<p><a id="11.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.1</span> CC is a form of attack which can occur only during the CCPh <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: vs Unarmed units (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.54" class="topiclink">20.54</a>), Reaction Fire (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.2" class="topiclink">D7.2</a>), Infantry OVR (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.152" class="topiclink">4.152</a>), TH-Hero Banzai Charge (<a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.423" class="topiclink">G1.423</a>)]</span> between opposing units in the same Location <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: CC with units in a pillbox never occurs in the same Location although it does occur between units in the same hex; <a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.6" class="topiclink">B30.6</a>]</span>. Units in different terrain features of the same Location (such as foxholes) still engage in CC with each other. There are no TEM or LOS Hindrance modifications to a CC attack DR, nor does PBF/TPBF ever apply to CC. Unlike Fire attacks, CC is <span class="f_Emphasis">usually</span> simultaneous, so both sides attack the other even if one or both is thereby eliminated.</p>
<p><a id="11.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.11 RESOLUTION:</span> The FP of attacking units is compared to the FP of those enemy units being attacked in order to achieve a ratio of attack-to-defense FP strength called odds. For example, if two 6-2-8 squads combine to attack a 4-6-7 squad the odds are 12-4, which is then rounded down to the nearest corresponding odds ratio printed on the CCT (EX: 7 to 4 would be 3-2; 11 to 2 would be 4-1; 4 to 15 would be 1-4). Once the odds have been determined, a DR is made for each attack. If the Final DR is &lt; the Kill Number listed on the CCT under the applicable odds column, the attacked units are eliminated. A Final DR which equals the Kill Number listed on the CCT is a Partial Kill: one (or more) defending unit suffers Casualty Reduction as determined by Random Selection. A Final DR &gt; the Kill Number has no effect. Normally the black Kill Numbers are used; see Hand-to-Hand CC (<a href="chj_chapj.htm#2.31" class="topiclink">J2.31</a>) for use of the red Kill Numbers.</p>

<p><a id="11.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.12 MECHANICS:</span> The ATTACKER specifies the order in which multiple Locations containing CC situations are to be resolved; each Location's CC for that Player Turn must be completely resolved before resolving CC in another Location. Barring sequential CC, each side in a Location must designate all of its attacks in that Location prior to the resolution of any of them (ATTACKER designating his first). The DEFENDER then designates all of his attacks, after which the ATTACKER resolves all of his previously declared attacks. The DEFENDER then resolves all of his attacks—even if those units have been eliminated, Reduced, or captured. Units may attack any unit or combination of units in the same Location <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: SMC; <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.14" class="topiclink">11.14</a>]</span>, so long as no unit attacks or is attacked <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Infantry OVR (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.152" class="topiclink">4.152</a>) or CC vs/by a vehicle]</span> more than once per CCPh. All units in the hex do not have to be attacked, nor do all units have to make an attack. See also <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.19" class="topiclink">11.19</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Assume that in the same Location, both players have three squads with a FP of four each, prior to Melee. Each player can choose to divide his combat in any of the following ways:</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A. &nbsp; &nbsp; One big 1-1 attack (12-12) involving all six units, or</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Three squads against one at 3-1 (12-4), or</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">C. &nbsp; &nbsp; Three separate 1-1 attacks (4-4) against each squad, or</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">D. &nbsp; &nbsp; A 2-1 attack (8-4) against one squad and a 1-2 (4-8) against the other two, or</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">E. &nbsp; &nbsp; A 2-1 attack (84) against one squad and a 1 -1 (4-4) against one of the other two.</span></p>
<p><a id="11.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.13 &nbsp;SW:</span> A SW/ordnance counter may not be used in CC. Each Gun/SW counter possessed by a unit eliminated in CC may also be eliminated if the Original colored dr of that CC DR is a 1. The attacker makes a subsequent dr for each Gun/SW possessed by the eliminated unit and if this dr is ≤ the black Kill Number of that CC attack, the Gun/SW of the unit is eliminated also. All other SW of units eliminated or captured in CC remain in the Location unpossessed until Recovered (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.44" class="topiclink">4.44</a>).</p>
<p><a id="11.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.14 SMC:</span> Any SMC in CC has an inherent FP attack and defense strength of one. A SMC may attack alone, but if it does, it must also defend alone and if occupying a Location with other friendly Personnel it must announce its solo attack status (although not necessarily the unit it will attack) before the opponent designates his attacks. Any number of SMC may combine with a MMC or other SMC to make a CC attack <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: vs vehicles; <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">11.5</a>]</span> and to defend by adding their inherent FP together, but a SMC must attack with the MMC it is stacked on top of if it is to combine FP with any MMC. The player is free to rearrange his stack in a CC Location so as to change the MMC that ≥ 1 SMC is stacked with, but he must do so prior to both sides' declaration of CC attacks in that Location.  </p>
<p>A SMC defends in CC as part of the group it attacks with by adding its inherent FP to the FP of the MMC stacked beneath it <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: A Known SMC may never defend with a concealed unit unless that unit forfeits its concealment so as to defend with the Known SMC, or vice versa]</span>. A CC attack cannot single out one or more SMC to attack unless the SMC(s) attack(s) without an MMC, or they are attempting to withdraw (or conversely, to stand) without an accompanying MMC. Otherwise, the smallest increment which can be the subject of a single CC attack is a single MMC (plus any SMC stacked directly above it).</p>
<p><a id="11.141"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.141 LEADER:</span> One leader may direct the CC attack of the unit(s) it defends with (and any other units which join them in a combined CC attack) by applying his leadership DRM to the CC DR, in addition to adding his inherent FP (or increasing the CCV; see <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">11.5</a>) to the strength of the attack. However, a leader may not use his leadership DRM to modify the CC DR of his own attack if he attacks alone or if any of the units attacking with him are berserk. Units in CC never take LLMC/LLTC.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A German 4-6-7 squad and 8-1 leader are in the same Location with two Russian 4-4-7 squads. The German player attacks both Russians squads at 1-2 (5-8) and can eliminate them both with an Original DR &lt; 5 due to the -1 leadership modifier. If the Original DR is a 5, at least one of the Russian squads is Reduced to a HS. The Russians attack at 3-2 (8-5) and can eliminate both German units with a DR &lt; 6. If the Russian player rolls a 6, the German player must make a Random Selection DR to determine which unit(s) suffers casualty Reduction.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: German 5-4-8 and 4-4-7 squads along with 9-2, 8-1, and 7-0 leaders are in the same Location as two Russian 6-2-8 squads. One, two, or three of the leaders could defend with either German squad, or all three could defend together without any MMC, or each separately, etc. Each leader will be stacked with the MMC it defends (and therefore attacks) with. The 9-2 and 7-0 leaders stack with the 5-4-8 (7 FP) while the 8-1 stacks with the 4-4-7 (5 FP). This prevents the two Russian squads from being able to muster 2:1 odds vs the 9-2 stack or 3:1 odds vs the 4-4-7. The 9-2 and 8-1 could each direct separate 1:1 and 1:2 attacks vs a different 6-2-8, but in the end the 9-2 directs one big 1:1 attack by all the Germans vs both Russian squads, which in turn combine to attack all the Germans at 1:1.</span></p>

Instead, the Basic Kill Number of any vehicle in CC is the <span class="f_Emphasis">Close Combat Value (CCV)</span> of the Personnel attacking it. The CCV of a squad is 5, a Crew is 4, a HS is 3, and a SMC is 2. The CCV is modified by +1 for an Assault Engineer, -1 for an Inexperienced unit, and +1 for a SMC combining with the main attacking unit in the same attack. A CCV subject to any form of halving FP penalty (such as being pinned) is reduced by one for each such penalty. If the CC DR is &lt; the CCV of the attacker, the vehicle is eliminated (and turned into a burning wreck if the CC DR is ≤ <span class="f_Emphasis">half</span> of the CCV). If the CC DR equals the CCV of the attacker the vehicle is immobilized instead. No more than two units may combine into a single CC attack vs a vehicle and one of the units in any combined attack must be a SMC who modifies the CCV of the other unit by +1. A single CC attack cannot affect both a vehicle and Personnel (except for the PRC of a vehicle, which are eliminated if the vehicle is destroyed). However, with multiple attackers in the same Location, one attack can be made vs Personnel (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.611" class="topiclink">11.611</a>) and subsequent attacks vs a vehicle, perhaps with a better chance of success due to the elimination of Personnel in the earlier attack.</p>

Whenever the attacker makes an Original 2 DR, he may roll a third die. If the subsequent dr is a 1, the vehicle is a burning wreck; if a 2 it is eliminated; if a 3 it is immobilized; otherwise there is no effect. However, regardless of the subsequent dr, if the Original 2 DR would have resulted in elimination or Immobilization that result still occurs, unless canceled by an elimination or burning result from the subsequent dr.</p>

A CC attack vs any vehicle without inherent manned functioning (e.g., Shock, stun, most BU AAMG) MG armament (including turreted MA ≤ 15mm) is eligible for a -1 DRM. There is a +1 DRM to the CC DR for every unbroken, unpinned, and armed <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> enemy HS/crew Personnel counter (+2 for each such squad) in the CC Location (and not in the act of Withdrawal) at the time of each attack unless they are BU. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> There is a +2 DRM for CC vs a Motion/non-stopped vehicle.

An unarmed, stopped/non-Motion vehicle without Personnel Escort is captured instantly in any CCPh in which it is alone with opposing Infantry. If an unarmored stationary vehicle has Passengers and the attacker wishes to capture (rather than eliminate) the vehicle, he must first attack and eliminate/capture all enemy Personnel in the Location, but must capture any Passengers. If all the Passengers are captured, so is the vehicle. The attacker must engage these Passengers in normal Infantry vs Infantry CC, but is eligible for both a -2 DRM for his attacks vs these Passengers and a +2 DRM in defending against attacks from those Passengers.

All Advances (shown by yellow arrows) have been completed. The German 9-2 and 4-6-7 at ground level in hex F3 Advance onto the Wire in F4 to Streetfight (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.8" class="topiclink">11.8</a>) the T-34. The 4-6-7 has passed a PAATC with an Original 8 which was modified by the 9-2, but the leader did not have to take one and waited to see the outcome of the squad's PAATC before advancing. The leader and squad could attack separately but elect to defend and attack together, allowing the leader to direct the attack. Because a vehicle is involved, CC is sequential with the German attacking first. Either the 9-2 or the 4-6-7 (but not both) may make an ATMM Check dr, but the leader would have a +2 drm. The squad opts to attempt the ATMM Check and obtains one with an Original 3 dr. The German CCV is 6 (5 for the squad plus 1 for the leader) with a total DRM of -5 (-1 Street Fighting Ambush, -3 ATMM, -2 Leadership Modifier, +1 Wire). The Original CC DR of 9 is modified to a Final DR of 4. Since this is less than the CCV, the T-34 is eliminated and flipped to its wreck side (Crew Survival NA). The German 9-2 and 4-6-7 must stay in F4 due to the Wire; otherwise, they could have chosen to return to F3 because they were Street Fighting.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Because the 4-6-7 in G2 Advances into CC in a building Location in G3, Ambush can occur. The Ambush Status drm of the Russian is +1 (Lax, due to being Inexperienced) while the German drm is zero. No Ambush occurs when the Russian dr is a 3 and the German dr is a 2. The German declares a Capture attempt vs the 4-2-6 at 1:1 odds with a -1 DRM (Capture vs Inexperienced) while the 4-2-6 attacks the 4-6-7 back at 1:1 with zero DRM. The German Original CC DR of 6 results in Casualty Reduction, i.e., the Capture of one HS. The Russian original CC DR of 9 has no effect. The 4-2-6 is replaced by a 2-2-6 and a HS Prisoner possessed by the German. Taking advantage of the squad's status as a Guard, the German Deploys into two HS, one of which possesses the Prisoner HS. The survivors are now held in Melee. If the Russian Original CC DR had been 4, the 4-2-6 would have eliminated the 4-6-7 and thus would not have been Captured. If the 4-6-7 had been Casualty Reduced, the remaining 2-4-7 HS would still Capture a HS Prisoner.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Because at least one of the units in CC is concealed when the 2-4-7 Advances into G5 from G6, Ambush can occur. Both sides must now reveal their strength factors. (If one had been a dummy stack, it would be removed now.) Both the 2-4-7 and the 4-4-7 receive a -2 Ambush drm for being concealed, and the 2-4-7 Ambushes the 4-4-7 (which loses concealment) when their respective drs are 2 and 5 (since 0 is at least 3 less than 3), making CC sequential, and allowing the 2-4-7 to Withdraw, either </span><span class="f_Emphasis">before</span><span class="f_Example"> CC or </span><span class="f_Emphasis">after</span><span class="f_Example"> CC and before Melee. The 2-4-7 could choose to attack the 4-4-7 at 1:2 odds with a -1 DRM for Ambush. The 2-4-7 could keep its concealment if it eliminates the 4-4-7, and then could elect to Withdraw or not. The 2-4-7 would lose its concealment if it did not eliminate the 4-4-7 which would then attack back at 2:1 odds with +1 DRM for Ambush. If the 2-4-7 survives, it could then Withdraw. Not willing to risk CC, the 2-4-7 elects to use its Ambush advantage to Withdraw to G4 before CC. Unfortunately for the 2-4-7, there is a HIP Russian AT Gun and crew in G4 (outlined in white). The Gun and crew are placed on board unconcealed (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.21" class="topiclink">11.21</a>) and the 2-4-7 is eliminated.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">In hex H3, the German PzV and the Russian 6-2-8 and 4-4-7 have already engaged in CC this Player Turn when the PzV entered the Location during its MPh and the Infantry used CC Reaction Fire (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.21" class="topiclink">D7.21</a>). Since the units are not in Melee yet, Ambush can occur when the German 5-4-8 and Hero Advance into CC in this woods hex. There is no drm to the Russian Ambush Status dr, while the German Ambush dr receives +2 drm (+2 vehicle, +1 BU, -1 Stealthy [Hero]), but no Ambush occurs when the Original dr for each side is 3. The Hero must announce if defending alone before any attacks are designated, but defends (and attacks) with the 5-4-8. Despite going first in sequential CC due to being the non-vehicular side, the Russian need not attack the vehicle and so the 6-2-8 attacks the German Infantry at 1:1 odds with zero DRM, but has no effect with an Original CC DR of 8. Subsequent attack opportunities alternate between sides and the German 5-4-8 and Hero attack back at 1:1 odds with -1 DRM (Heroic). The Original CC DR is 2, resulting in Infiltration and Field Promotion (<a href="cha_cha18.htm#18.12" class="topiclink">18.12</a>), as well as eliminating the 6-2-8. The German dr on the Leader Creation table is an Original 4 with a -2 drm (-1 German, -1 ML 8) resulting in a Final dr of 2, creating an 8-0 leader. Adding the leader to the attack does not change the result, and the German Infantry Withdraws to H2. Even if CC had not been sequential, the attacking German Infantry would have made its CC attack first and the Russian 4-4-7 would still have been unable to attack the German Infantry before it withdrew. The 4-4-7 now turns its attack against the PzV with a CCV of 5. Since the AFV is in Bypass and no Ambush occurred, the 4-4-7 receives the -1 Street Fighting Ambush DRM and Immobilizes the PzV with an Original CC DR of 6. No Immobilization TC is required. The PzV then attacks with its sN Close Defense Weapon System (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.622" class="topiclink">11.622</a>). Its Original IFT DR of 7 is ≤ its Usage #, so it attacks </span><span class="f_Emphasis">all</span><span class="f_Example"> unarmored units with 16 FP (no TEM or DRM ever apply) resulting in a 2MC vs the 4-4-7. If the 6-2-8 had survived or the German Infantry not Withdrawn, they would be attacked also. The 4-4-7 passes the 2MC, and the PzV attacks again with its 5 FP CMG vs the 4-4-7's CCV of 5 at 1:1 odds with +1 DRM (+1 Street Fighting Ambush). If the 4-4-7 had failed its 2 MC, the -2 DRM for broken would also apply to the CMG attack, for total DRM of -1. If the 4-4-7 had rolled an Original MC DR of 2 on its 2MC, Heat of Battle would apply. The Original CC DR of 12 results in the CMG Malfunctioning and Infiltration, allowing the 4-4-7 to Withdraw to H4. If the 4-4-7 stayed in the Location with the Immobile PzV instead of withdrawing, the squad would be locked in Melee; but the vehicle would not be held in Melee despite being Immobile, although it still could not shoot outside the Location it shares with the 4-4-7.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Being Fanatic, the 5-4-8 in J4 is exempt from PAATC when it Advances into I5 and attacks the T34/85 in sequential CC using Street Fighting. The German makes an ATMM check and rolls an Original 6, pinning the 5-4-8 and reducing its CCV to 4. DRM are -2 (-1 Street Fighting Ambush, -1 CE). The German then rolls an Original CC DR of 12 resulting in Casualty Reduction from Crew Small Arms (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.621" class="topiclink">11.621</a>). The T34/85 attacks with its CMG vs the CCV of the surviving, pinned 2-3-8 HS at 2:1 odds (4 FP:2 CCV [3 CCV -1 pinned]) with +1 DRM for Street Fighting Ambush. The Original CC DR of 9 has no effect. Since the 2-3-8 is pinned, it cannot return to its building Location and is locked in Melee with the vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Hex K4 has been in Melee for two Player Turns. The German 4-6-7 attacks the Russian 4-4-7 at 1:1 odds with zero DRM while the 8-1 declares it will attempt to Withdraw from Melee with the 4-6-7 covering. (If this were the first round of CC rather than Melee, the leader could not attempt to Withdraw.) The two Russian squads attack both German units at 3:2; zero DRM apply vs the 4-6-7 and -1 DRM apply to the leader (-2 Withdrawing, +1 covering unit). Since the leader is Withdrawing it cannot defend with the 4-6-7 so the Russian could have attacked them separately, 1:1 vs the squad and 4:1 vs the leader with the same DRM as the combined 3:2 attack. The German rolls an Original 12 CC DR resulting in no effect other than Infiltration for the Russian, who can now choose to Withdraw either or both squads </span><span class="f_Emphasis">before</span><span class="f_Example"> making an attack.

The Russian Withdraws the 4-4-7 to K5 and attacks both German units with the 5-2-7 at 1:1 odds with the same DRM as before. The original CC DR of 6 results in Casualty Reduction for the leader. The Wound Severity dr of 5 eliminates the leader but no LLMC is required. The 4-6-7 and 5-2-7 remain in Melee.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Because the 4-4-7 in L5 passed a PAATC when the PzTVH entered its Location in the MPh, the squad retained its &quot;?&quot; when it opted not to make a CC Reaction Fire attack. The 4-4-7 now attacks the PzIVH first in sequential CC with a CCV of 5 with zero DRM. Street Fighting Ambush is NA since the 4-4-7 did not advance out of a building to attack the AFV. The Original CC DR of 7 has no effect. The AFV then attacks the squad at 1:1 odds (5 FP CMG vs 5 CCV) with zero DRM, but has no effect with an Original CC DR of 7. A Melee counter is placed in L5, although a vehicle cannot be held in Melee. If in the PzIV's next MPh it expends a Start MP, the 4-4-7 will no longer be held in Melee and could conduct a CC Reaction Fire (but not a Non-CC Reaction Fire) attack, with a +2 DRM for the AFV being Non-Stopped. The 4-4-7 which Withdrew from K4 to K5 could also attack the PzIVH on its Start MP using Street Fighting CC Reaction Fire (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.211" class="topiclink">D7.211</a>) with DRM of +1 (-1 Street Fighting Ambush, +2 Non-Stopped). Because the 4-4-7 in L5 was concealed at the start of CCPh, it could opt to not attack in CC, retaining its &quot;?&quot;. The AFV's CC attack would be halved to 1:2 (2½ FP:5 CCV). If this attack has no effect, the 4-4-7 would continue to retain its &quot;?&quot; and not be held in Melee.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">The broken 2-2-7 in J2 routed there from I3. Since the 3-3-8 is not Known, the 2-2-7 could have continued routing to K2 but would have been eliminated when it tried to enter the 3-3-8's Location. Because the 3-3-8 is not Known, the 2-2-7 can end its RtPh ADJACENT without being eliminated. When the 3-3-8 Advances into CC in the J2 building Location, Ambush can occur (even if the 3-3-8 were not concealed).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">The Russian Ambush Status drm is +1 (Broken) while the German dim is -2 (concealed). The Russian is Ambushed when both roll an Original 5 Ambush dr. Even if there had been no Ambush, the broken 2-2-7 could not attack the 3-3-8, which attacks the 2-2-7 at 3:2 odds with -3 DRM (-1 Ambush, -2 broken), but rolls an Original CC DR of 11 for no effect. Because the 3-3-8 did not eliminate the its target, it loses concealment but can still Withdraw due to the ambush. If it does not Withdraw, it will be in Melee with the broken 2-2-7, which would then be relieved of the obligation to rout in the next RtPh, being required instead to Withdraw from Melee in the next CCPh while facing CC DRM of -4 (-2 broken, -2 Withdrawing).</span></p>
<p><a id="11.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.6 CC vs AN AFV:</span> In order for a MMC to <span class="f_Emphasis">advance</span> into a Location containing a manned unconcealed enemy AFV, it must first pass a PAATC (failure of which causes the unit to become pinned). SMC, Fanatic, and Berserk units are exempt from PAATC. A leader may use his leadership modifier to aid any units in the same Location with their respective PAATC even if he does not advance into the Location himself. All Inexperienced Infantry must take a 1TC rather than a NTC in order to advance into a manned enemy AFV's Location. Once in the same Location with an enemy AFV during the CCPh, no further PAATC is necessary in order to attack it during CC. A unit which passes a PAATC must immediately advance into the AFV Location; it may not await the outcome of another unit's PAATC before deciding whether or not it wishes to advance. PAATC attempts need not be predesignated.</p>

A CC attack vs a CE CT AFV is eligible for a -1 DRM.

All such FP is used to form Odds ratios vs the defender's CCV and uses the CCT black Kill Numbers, and is never increased due to any condition—although it can be halved due to Motion/or vs concealed units/by Pinned units (cumulatively), or negated (see Shock; <a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.42" class="topiclink">C7.42</a> and Stun; <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.34" class="topiclink">D5.34</a>). A defender's CCV cannot be reduced below 1; treat any condition that would do so as a CC DRM instead. Multiple ROF never applies in CC, nor do Intensive Fire penalties/restrictions.

It can be used to make a HE attack on the IFT if the AFV is BU, but only during the CCPh after the AFV or its Personnel Escort has been attacked in that CCPh (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.31" class="topiclink">11.31</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: an AFV may fire a Nahverteidigungswaffe before being attacked if it qualifies as the Ambusher; <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">11.4</a>]</span>.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="cha_chafootnotes.htm#16" class="topiclink">16</a></span> An AFV with this capability is identified by the symbol &quot;sN&quot; on the back of its counter. If fired (see <a href="chd_chd13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">D13.3</a>), it must attack all unarmored units in its Location (including friendly Personnel/Vulnerable PRC/unarmored vehicle) with 16 factors on the IFT. A Close Defense Weapon System attack cannot be combined with any other form of FP. No To Hit DR is necessary, but if the Original IFT DR is &gt; its Usage Number there is no effect (see <a href="chd_chd13.htm#13.34" class="topiclink">D13.34</a>). Despite the use of the IFT, TEM/SMOKE/other LOS Hindrances never apply to the resolution of a CC attack.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Three Russian 4-4-7 squads and an 8-1 leader wish to advance into an Open Ground hex containing a BU, Mobile, stationary German PzIVJ tank. Each squad (aided by the leader) makes a DR ≤ 8 for their PAATC (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.6" class="topiclink">11.6</a>) enabling all four units to advance into the German AFV's hex during that APh. In the ensuing CCPh, the Russian will get to attack first because CC vs a vehicle is sequential (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.31" class="topiclink">11.31</a>). His first attack is with squad A and the leader for a CCV of 6. The only applicable DRM is the leadership modifier of the 8-1 leader so the tank will be immobilized on an Original DR of 7, eliminated on an Original DR ≤ 6, and burns on an Original DR ≤ 3 (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">11.5</a>). The Original DR is a 7 so the tank has been immobilized. It is now the tank's turn to attack and it does so with its Close Defense Weapon System by attacking on the IFT with 16 FP (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.622" class="topiclink">11.622</a>). The IFT DR is a 7 resulting in a 2MC vs all four Russian units. The Russian leader breaks as do squads A and C, but no LLTC is required (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.141" class="topiclink">11.141</a>). It is now the Russian's turn to attack again, but he has only one unbroken squad left with which to attack. That squad has a CCV of 5, but because the tank is now immobile the Russian qualifies for a -1 DRM. He can eliminate it with an Original DR ≤ 5. However, he rolls a 7 and it is again the German's turn to make a CC attack; this time with his 5 FP coaxial MG which is all he has left to attack with. Bow MG are not usable in CC and AAMG usually must be CE to be fired (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.62" class="topiclink">11.62</a>). Nevertheless, the tank now has a choice of making a 1-1 (5-5) vs squad B or C, 1-2 (5-10) vs squads B and C, or 1-2 (5-6) vs squad A and the leader, or 1-4 (5-16) vs all four units. He opts to attack all four units at 1-4, mainly because he gets a -2 DRM vs the three broken units (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.16" class="topiclink">11.16</a>). His Original DR is a 5 which causes Casualty Reduction among the three broken units; the unbroken squad B is not affected. A Random Selection (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">A.9</a>) DR results in reducing squad A to a HS and wounding the leader due to a tie highest dr. At this point the CCPh ends since neither side has anything left to attack with which hasn't already been used in this phase. As the immobilized German AFV cannot move, it will hold all four Russian units in its hex in Melee until the next CCPh when new attacks and Withdrawal from Melee attempts may be made although the AFV may attack the Infantry during the PFPh.</span></p>
