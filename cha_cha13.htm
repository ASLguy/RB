<p><a id="13.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.1</span> Cavalry<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="cha_chafootnotes.htm#19" class="topiclink">19</a></span> is any Personnel unit Riding a horse, and is symbolized by placing the Personnel Counter directly atop the Horse Counter. The instant Cavalry dismounts it is treated as Infantry with a separate Horse counter. Any Personnel unit that mounts a horse is considered qualified Cavalry.</p>
<p><a id="13.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.2 STACKING:</span> Cavalry stacking limits are equal to those for Infantry (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">5.5</a>). There is no limit to the amount of unmounted horses in a hex.</p>
<p><a id="13.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.3 MOVEMENT:</span> Cavalry is not vehicular in nature; it has no VCA, and expends MF (not MP) as per the Cavalry column of the Terrain Chart. This column also lists all terrain types in which Cavalry/horses are NA (though movement through building hexes via Infantry Bypass is allowed; see <a href="chd_chdintro.htm#.2" class="topiclink">D.2</a>). The normal cost for Cavalry to move along a TB in woods is 3 MF. Cavalry may make a Minimum Move like Infantry <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: both the Cavalry unit and its horse become CX; Cavalry does not pin (<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.52" class="topiclink">13.52</a>)]</span>. Cavalry cannot receive a leader-MF bonus (see also <a href="chb_chb3.htm#3.4" class="topiclink">B3.4</a>), but a Cavalry leader may provide a leader-MF bonus (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.12" class="topiclink">4.12</a>) to <span class="f_Emphasis">Infantry</span> if they all move as a stack throughout their MPh.

<p><a id="13.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.31 MF COSTS:</span> (Dis)mounting a Horse counter costs one MF of the basic 4-MF allotment of any Infantry unit (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11</a>), but is NA during the APh. When (dis)mounting, the unit also <span class="f_Emphasis">loses</span> one MF of its basic MF allotment for every 25% of the horse's <span class="f_Emphasis">current</span> MF allotment (i.e., 12, 16 or 20 MF; <a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.34" class="topiclink">13.34</a>, <a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.36" class="topiclink">13.36</a>) that the latter has already used/lost during that MPh, and the horse loses 25% of its current MF allotment for each MF expended (not lost) by the Infantry/Cavalry unit in that MPh prior to and during this (dis)mounting. A Horse counter may be dismounted after having been mounted/moved earlier in the same MPh, but it may not be mounted in the same MPh after having been dismounted or otherwise having moved.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: An Infantry SMC that moves into an Open Ground hex (one MF) and mounts a SMC Horse counter (one MF) leaves the horse with six MF remaining out of its current 12-MF allotment. If he then declares a Gallop, he increases the horse's current MF allotment to 16 and its available MF to 10. If he wishes to dismount in the same MPh, however, he can expend no &gt; 4 more Cavalry MF before doing so, because he must expend one MF to dismount and will also lose another MF for the 1-4 MF expended by the horse while he was Riding it.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A Cavalry unit that declares a Gallop at the start of its MPh can expend no more than 15 Cavalry MF if it wishes to dismount in the same MPh, because dismounting will cause the horse to lose five MF (25% X 20 [current MF allotment] = 5 MF).</span></p>

A single animal (one horse depiction) can carry just one or two SMC. See also <a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.33" class="topiclink">13.33</a>. If a single Infantry unit can and wishes to mount a Horse counter that is too &quot;large&quot; for it, that Horse counter first automatically either Deploys into two HS Horse counters (if that Infantry unit is a HS or crew) or creates a SMC Horse counter (if that Infantry unit is a SMC) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: no SMC horse is created if the SMC will mount a Horse counter that is already carrying its capacity of MMC]</span>. In addition, a Cavalry SMC may create a SMC Horse counter from its MMC Horse counter at any time during its MPh in order to move separately from the latter. Otherwise, a squad Horse counter can be split into two HS Horse counters only to satisfy losses or when the squad Riding it Deploys. Horse counters may Recombine when their HS Riders do (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.32" class="topiclink">1.32</a>), or whenever the proper number occupy the same Location while unmounted and &quot;accompanied&quot; (<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.7" class="topiclink">13.7</a>).</p>

<p><a id="13.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.6 CHARGE:</span> Cavalry may Charge a Known-enemy-occupied Location, provided it declares a Charge vs that Location while in the LOS of and at a range of ≥ three hexes from it, is Galloping (or declares a Gallop) when it declares the Charge, can Gallop into that Location, and pays three MF (simultaneously with the cost to enter the target Location) to make the attack. After undergoing all Defense/Subsequent First Fire/FPF (see also <a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.351" class="topiclink">13.351</a>), it then (if still able) attacks its targets) with TPBF/MOL—(if available), neither halved for Mounted Fire nor penalized by the <span class="f_Emphasis">horse's</span> CX status. Thereafter it need not declare a further Charge during that MPh until it actually enters a new target hex. Each Charging unit attacks separately unless moving as a stack (/Cavalry Wave; <a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.62" class="topiclink">13.62</a>) with ≥ one other Cavalry unit, in which case they attack together.</p>
<p><img src="a136ex.gif" width="276" height="176" alt="a136ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: A 4-4-7 and 8-0 mounted on the same squad Horse counter in 4N6 have declared a Gallop, and a Charge vs the 4-6-7 in K5. The 4-6-7 Defensive First Fires at the stack with four FP, and a -2 DRM vs the Cavalry, as they enter M6. The Original DR is a 7 which spares the horses but becomes a Final IFT DR of 5 vs the Cavalry, resulting in a 1MC which the 8-0 fails but the 4-4-7 passes. The 8-0 must now take a Bailing Out NMC which he fails, causing him to suffer Casualty Reduction—but the 4-4-7 takes no LLTC/LLMC (<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.52" class="topiclink">13.52</a>). As the 4-4-7 Rides into L5 (second MF), the 4-6-7 Subsequent First Fires with four FP (Area Fire and PBF), still with a -2 DRM vs the 4-4-7. The Original DR is a 5, which Reduces the squad Horse counter to a HS Horse counter; the 4-4-7 must take a 2MC (due to the Final IFT DR of 3) which it passes, but Deploys into two 2-3-7 HS because one HS must Bail Out due to the Reduction of the horses (<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.511" class="topiclink">13.511</a>). The remaining Cavalry HS pays four MF (one for entry plus three for the Charge attack) and enters K5. The 4-6-7 then makes its mandatory FPF attack (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.312" class="topiclink">8.312</a> and <a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.351" class="topiclink">13.351</a>) with six FP (Area Fire and TPBF) but rolls an Original 10, breaking itself but leaving the Cavalry unaffected. The 2-3-7 Cavalry now makes its six-FP (TPBF) Charge attack which is resolved immediately.</span></p>
<p><a id="13.61"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.61 POST-RESOLUTION:</span> After resolving its Charge attack, Cavalry may remain mounted in its current hex, dismount, or enter another Location (even declaring another Charge against that Location), provided it has sufficient MF remaining to do so. If it remains in an enemy-occupied Location, it is not yet considered in Melee (although it may attack and can be attacked in the upcoming CCPh) and should be marked with a CC counter. A unit that declared a Charge in its MPh may not attack, etc., during the ensuing AFPh even if currently dismounted, and at the end of its MPh is marked with a Prep Fire counter as a reminder of its status.</p>
<p><a id="13.62"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.62 CAVALRY WAVE:</span> Cavalry may make Human Wave attacks as per <a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.23" class="topiclink">25.23-.235</a> (and <a href="che_che1.htm#1.423" class="topiclink">E1.423</a>) except as stated otherwise. Any nationality may make a Cavalry Wave attack. To declare a Cavalry Wave, at least one squad-equivalent of Cavalry must occupy each hex of the chain, no unit in the chain can be within three hexes of an enemy unit, at least one unit in the chain must be within 16 MF of and have a LOS to an enemy unit, and all units must immediately Gallop. An average of ≥ one MMC per hex of the chain and at least one leader must participate. The morale of Cavalry does not increase during a Cavalry Wave. At least one participating unit must Charge an enemy unit during that MPh. Each Charging unit need not end its MPh upon entering an enemy-occupied hex. Cavalry and Infantry cannot make a combined Human Wave attack.</p>
<p><a id="13.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.7 HORSES:</span> Horses are units, but are never considered enemy units. A Horse counter may be captured in the same manner as a SW via Recovery (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.44" class="topiclink">4.44</a>), but need not be Recovered by the side that last possessed it. No horse may be transported by vehicle <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: LC; <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">G12.12</a>]</span>, portaged, or moved in the RtPh/APh or by Assault Movement. Aside from LC movement, an unmounted horse may move only if accompanied by Infantry/Cavalry, and does so at no extra MF cost to either the Infantry (using Infantry MF costs) or the horse/Cavalry (using Cavalry MF costs), but still may not enter terrain prohibited to Cavalry except via Bypass. Each unbroken Infantry/Cavalry unit can &quot;lead&quot; Horse counters equal to triple its own size (i.e., a SMC may lead ≤ three SMC Horse counters, a HS or crew may lead a squad Horse counter plus a HS Horse counter, etc.). A unit leading a Horse counter may eliminate that counter as if it were a SW. A horse itself cannot carry a SW <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Animal Pack; <a href="chg_chg10.htm" class="topiclink">G10</a>]</span>, and its being CX does not affect its Rider's (non-)CX status (e.g., non-CX Cavalry on a CX horse would not generate a +1 CX Ambush drm as per <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">11.4</a>).
