Any Panji/Wire/Entrenchment movement may be in addition to entering a new Location during an Impulse.

Once any HW Unit enters such a Location during an Impulse, the Location is no longer devoid of friendly units, freeing other HW Units from the requirement to enter that Location during that Impulse. Upon entry of an enemy-occupied Location, mark all units with a CC counter. If a Location entered contains one enemy SMC only, Infantry OVR (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.15" class="topiclink">4.15</a>) is automatic without a NTC and with normal (non-doubled) MF cost, and the SMC cannot move to another Location.

He must now choose a (alternate) Hex Grain that includes O3 and is as close to a HW Unit as possible. Possible (alternate) Hex Grains are: O1-O2-O3-O4...; P1-O2-O3-N3...; P1-P2-O3-O4...; Q2-P2-O3-N3...; and R2-Q3-P2-O3... which all have a range of 0 to a HW Unit. He chooses P1-P2-O3-O4.... by marking it with HW Direction counters. During the Human Wave, a unit's forward hexes will be the hexes that share hexsides 4 and 5 (see Sniper counter) with the unit's current hex, and its side hexes will be the hexes that share hexsides 3 and 6 with the current hex (i.e., a HW Unit in P2 will have O3 and P3 as forward hexes and O2 and Q3 as side hexes). If instead the non-alternate Hex Grain Q2-P2-O3-N3... had been chosen, a unit's forward hexes would be the hexes that share hexsides 4, 5 and 6, and there would be no side hexes (i.e., a HW Unit in P2 would have O2, O3, P3 as forward hexes).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">As his first Impulse the Russian moves all elements of the chain forward one hex as shown, at a total cost of two MF (because the units in Q2 and R2 had to cross a hedge). The units that entered N1 and O2 are marked with a Range counter (<a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.2321" class="topiclink">25.2321</a>) since they increased the range to the HW alternate Hex Grain and must decrease the range before they can increase it again. The German 4-6-7 attacks N1 with its inherent 4 FP and -2 FFMO/FFNAM DRM and rolls an Original 9, which results in a PTC which is ineffective vs a Human Wave. The 4-6-7 is marked with a First Fire counter. The squad now fires the MMG directed by the 8-1 leader (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.53" class="topiclink">7.53</a>) at O2 and P2 with Spraying PBF. The attack is 5 FP (Area &amp; PBF) with a -3 DRM (grain is not in season). The Original DR is an 8 (with a 2 colored dr), resulting in a 1MC vs both hexes. The Russian player rolls a 9 for the leader which breaks and now no longer has its Morale Level increased. All four squads roll ≤ 7 and are unaffected. They need not take a LLTC because they are part of a Human Wave (which is immune to Pin results). However, the MMG retained its Multiple ROF and—because the Russian Impulse used two MF—it may First Fire again and chooses to repeat the same attack. This time it rolls an Original 5 (2 on the colored dr), resulting in a K/2. The Random Selection DR in O2 is a tie, so both squads are Reduced to HS (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.302" class="topiclink">7.302</a>) before taking a 2MC, which they each pass by rolling ≤ 6. The Random Selection DR in P2 selects the broken leader, who wounds, rolls a 5 on his Wound Severity dr (<a href="cha_cha17.htm#17.11" class="topiclink">17.11</a>), and thus is eliminated. If, however, the leader had survived, it would not then have to take the 2MC. The two squads roll a 6 and 7 for their 2MC which breaks one, which then passes its LLMC with a 7 [errata included]. The MG has retained its Multiple ROF and the German wants to fire again but cannot, because two shots are all that are allowed vs a moving unit that expended only two MF in its Location. The MG cannot avoid this by picking another target, because all of the units in its LOS moved simultaneously as part of the same Impulse (moreover, the other targets are all outside of the MG's now-fixed CA; <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>).</span></p>

The Russian moves all unbroken units forward as shown. Since the 4-4-7 in P2 enters O3, the two 2-3-7 in O2 are free from the restriction of <a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.234" class="topiclink">25.234</a> and may instead move to N2, which one of them does, while the other enters O3. Of the units that were marked with Range counters in the first Impulse, the two 4-4-7 in N1 and the 2-3-7 that enter O3 can remove their Range counters since they now decrease the range, while the 2-3-7 that enters N2 does not and must keep its Range counter.

PF range is limited to one hex prior to June 1944 and two hexes from June 1944 on. All non-date-dependent PF check drm apply normally. Additionally, Conscripts receive a +1 PF Check drm, Elite Romanians receive a -1 PF check drm vs AFV, and all Romanians receive a +1 PF check drm in scenarios set in 1945. The total number of PF shots taken in a scenario may not exceed the number of squad-equivalents for Hungarians in 1944-45 and for Romanians in 1945, and 1½ times the number of squad-equivalents for Romanians in 1944.</p>
