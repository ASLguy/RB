Infantry can be moved in any direction or combination of directions up to the limit of their movement allotment, which is measured in Movement Factors. Infantry units may move over and stack on top of other friendly units, although their ability to do so with enemy units during the MPh is restricted to a few specific cases (see <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.14" class="topiclink">4.14</a>). Each unit's movement allotment may be increased, decreased, or restricted by certain circumstances.</p>

A MF bonus of one can be earned for road movement (see <a href="chb_chb3.htm#3.4" class="topiclink">B3.4</a>). A MF cannot be transferred between units nor can it be accumulated from turn to turn. All Personnel and Horse-Drawn transport use MF as opposed to vehicular counters which use Movement Points (MP).</p>

<p><a id="4.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.13 TERRAIN EFFECTS:</span> Whenever Infantry moves into a hex during the MPh, it expends MF for that turn equal to the cost of the terrain within that hex as listed on the Infantry column of the MF Entrance Cost portion of the Terrain Chart/Desert Terrain Chart/PTO Terrain Chart, unless using Bypass movement.</p>
<p><a id="4.131"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.131 &nbsp;HEXSIDE COSTS:</span> Certain types of terrain depictions conform to hexsides. When crossing such a hexside to enter a new hex, an Infantry unit pays a specified number of MF for crossing that hexside plus the Cost of Terrain (COT) of the hex entered.</p>
<p><a id="4.132"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.132 ROAD:</span> Infantry entering a hex via a road hexside must pay either the road entry cost or the cost of other terrain in the hex. Road movement costs for Infantry are not cumulative with that of other terrain in the same hex (except for SMOKE). If Infantry pays the cost of other terrain in the hex, it is considered in that terrain and avoids FFMO DRM unless that other terrain is Open Ground. If any LOS Hindrance (such as SMOKE) or Artificial Terrain (such as AFV/wreck) is present, FFMO is negated even though the unit uses Road movement. Otherwise, if it pays only the road entry cost, it is subject to FFMO DRM (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.6" class="topiclink">4.6</a>) in that hex if the LOS can be traced to either of the two target points (a/b below) in that hex without crossing an obstruction in that hex. If the target enters at the road rate, the firer has the option of tracing LOS to either: a) the hex center dot, or b) the point where the hexside crossed intersects the road used. If the LOS to one target point is blocked, the firer can still fire at the other with no additional penalty.</p>

However, if the squad entered I4 at a cost of two MF without using Assault Movement, only the FFNAM (-1) and Woods TEM (+1) would apply (cumulatively). Fire from I5 or J4 to I4 (represented by the blue arrows) would never receive the -1 FFMO DRM because it must trace its LOS through the Woods depiction in I4. Fire from H4 or I3 would qualify for the -1 FFMO DRM (red arrows) only if the unit entered I4 at the one MF rate across the H3-I4 hexside, because otherwise it would have to trace its LOS through the woods depiction in I4 (blue arrows)</span></p>

It may attack the moving units on the IFT normally (non-heroic leaders with no SW have no such FP) with PBF/TPBF as applicable, and then, if the MMC is in the SMC's Location, engage in immediate CC during that MPh; <span class="f_Emphasis">or</span> the SMC may immediately, prior to any Defensive First Fire vs the ATTACKER, enter (free of all enemy fire) into any adjacent Accessible Location of the ATTACKER's choice which is not occupied by an enemy unit. The ATTACKER may not force the SMC into a minefield, FFE, Wire, or Open Ground hex if an alternate choice is available as the ATTACKER's MMC enters its hex. If the SMC is broken, pinned, already held in Melee, TI, occupying a vehicle, or otherwise incapable of movement it does not have this movement option, and its attack options are restricted as befits its status. This movement or attack option can be used by the same SMC again during that MPh if it is OVR by Infantry again, provided it is not now held in Melee.</p>
<p><a id="4.152"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.152 CC:</span> If, after Defensive First Fire, the SMC remains in its Location with the entering MMC, normal CC immediately ensues during that MPh. Should the SMC be eliminated or captured, the OVR unit(s) which defeated it may continue their MPh from that Location with any remaining MF allotment. Other units which have not already ended their MPh may then also transit the Location during that MPh. Should the SMC survive this initial CC, it and the OVR units are considered in Melee, marked with a Melee counter, and subject to CC again in that Location in that turn's CCPh. Should another MMC attempt to OVR it while the SMC is in Melee, that MMC may attack it in CC (even though the SMC has already been attacked during that MPh and may not attack back in that MPh) but only the newly arriving attacking unit(s) is eligible to continue movement with any remaining MF in that MPh if successful.</p>

A hexside forming a part of a Wire Location, or covered by a Water Obstacle (24L9-M9), may not be Bypassed (<a href="chb_chb26.htm#26.44" class="topiclink">B26.44</a>) on either side of the hexside; roadblocks also have Bypass restrictions (<a href="chb_chb29.htm#29.4" class="topiclink">B29.4</a>). SMOKE does not prevent Bypass but adds to the MF cost (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.7" class="topiclink">24.7</a>) of transit through the hex. Bypass may be used in a mined woods/building hex but does not prevent mine attacks. Use of Bypass movement does not prevent placement of a DC (<a href="cha_cha23.htm#23.3" class="topiclink">23.3</a>) or SMOKE grenade (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.1" class="topiclink">24.1</a>). Bypass must be announced with the expenditure of MF as the unit moves inside the building/woods hex. A unit that decides to occupy an obstacle it is currently Bypassing must pay the entire in-hex MF cost to enter that obstacle even though it is already in the hex.</p>

Bypass may exceed two contiguous unblocked hexsides per hex, but in so doing the Bypass cost for that hex is doubled. Remember that the unit is moving around the obstacle within the hex—not through it. Should there be any question whether a building or woods symbol touches a hexside, Bypass in that hex is blocked (i.e., is not allowed) along that hexside. Walls and hedges are considered extensions of hexsides for purposes of applying the mechanics of this rule; therefore if a wall/hedge depiction touches a building/woods depiction, bypass is blocked along that hexside.</p>

The squad cannot move into any hex other than C5 or D5 at this point during its MPh, unless it expends another MF for continued Bypass to D4-D5-E5 or D4-E4-E5; however, it can enter the building in D4 by expending two more MF.</span></p>

<p><a id="4.34"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.34 BYPASS LOS:</span> Infantry using Bypass are subject to special terrain modifiers and LOS rules. A unit firing at a Bypassing unit does not have to trace its LOS to the target hex center, but has the option to make its one allowed LOS check per attack to either hex vertex along a hexside traversed by a unit moving in Bypass (thus a choice of two vertices for one hexside Bypass, three vertices for two hexsides Bypassed, etc.) instead. Should the LOS of a firing unit reach an Open Ground Bypass hexside vertex unobstructed (see also <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">C.5</a>), that unit can claim a LOS and a First Fire -2 DRM for non-Assault Movement in the open. A wall or hedge in the target hex is <span class="f_Emphasis">not an obstacle to LOS</span> even though the target may be in Bypass on the other side of that same target hex (although its TEM would apply if crossed by the LOS). If the firer traces his LOS to the hex center, it must cross a bypassed hexside (thus usually qualifying for a -2 DRM for Non-Assault Movement in Open Ground) before reaching that hex center or the LOS is blocked. If a unit is using Bypass (including VBM) along a Crest Line, and the obstacle it is Bypassing is on the higher level of that Crest Line, then the unit is also at that higher level (since a Crest Line itself cannot be Bypassed; <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">4.3</a>).</p>

If it declares D4-E4, D4-E5, however, it is out of LOS from C7 at the D4-D3-E4 vertex because that vertex cannot be seen through the building in D4. The firer can trace its LOF to the D4-E4-E5, D4-D5-E5, or the D4-C5-D5 vertices but the FFMO DRM will not apply due to the wall TEM activated by the LOS crossing the wall at D4-D5.

<p>Because the existence of an Open Ground Location can be dependent on the LOS of any potential firer into that Location, it is possible that a declared Dash might not qualify as such vs one or more DEFENDING units. In this case, Dash First-Fire penalties may apply to some DEFENDERS but not to others. Once a Dash is declared, no other movement/MF-expenditure options are available to the Dashing unit and Armored Assault (<a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.31" class="topiclink">D9.31</a>) is NA.</p>

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The 4-6-7 has declared a Dash to 4AA7, thus halving the FP of the 4-4-7 in Y9 which fires on it in BB7. However, a 6-2-8 hidden in CC6 now drops its HIP to fire on the 4-6-7 in BB7 or AA7. The halving FP of a Dash does not apply to the 6-2-8 because AA7 is Open Ground to it. Even if the 4-4-7 were to fire after the 6-2-8, its FP would still be halved because AA7 and CCS are not Open Ground Locations vs fire from Y9. Even if AA7 were a building hex, an attack by the 6-2-8 vs AA7 would not be halved because the 4-6-7 is Dashing only in BB7—not in the hex it is moving to. None of this would change if the road ended in BB7, or if there were another road running from AA7 to CCS.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Assume AA7 were a building hex and that a leader was Dashing with the 4-6-7. If the leader broke in BB7, the 4-6-7 could declare Double Time and continue Dashing into AA7. If for any reason the 4-6-7 did not have enough MF to enter AA7, it would be stuck in BB7 without Dash benefits.</span><span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span></p>
