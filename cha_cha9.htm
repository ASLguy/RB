<p>[A LMG counter represents a weapon additional to the inherent complement of such weapons present in a squad and accounted for by that squad's FP. The inherent LMG of a squad counter is not subject to any of the following rules, nor can it ever be turned into a LMG counter.]</p>
<p><a id="9.1"></a><img src="germanlmg.gif" width="62" height="61" alt="germanlmg" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9.1 COUNTERS:</span> A ½&quot; MG counter is a SW and is dependent on Personnel to portage and fire it. Each SW MG has a two-number hyphenated Strength Factor; the number on the left is its FP and the number on the right is its Normal Range as measured in hexes. See also <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.4" class="topiclink">4.4</a>, <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">9.2</a>, and <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.7" class="topiclink">9.7-.72</a>.</p>
<p><a id="9.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.11 MMC USAGE:</span> A squad may fire any one SW MG at no cost to its own Inherent FP, or any two SW MG at their normal MG FP effect at the cost of forfeiting its own Inherent FP for the current and any remaining fire phases in that Player Turn <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.353" class="topiclink">7.353</a>]</span>. Any other MMC may fire only one SW MG (regardless of type) with full FP, but in so doing forfeits its Inherent FP for any remaining fire phases in that Player Turn <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.353" class="topiclink">7.353</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="9.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.12 SMC USAGE:</span> Unless otherwise prohibited, a single leader may fire any one SW MG as Area Fire, while two SMC stacked together may fire any one SW MG counter at full FP. If a leader fires/uses a SW-MG/any-other-SW (either singly or in combination with another SMC), he loses any leadership DRM he may have otherwise exerted during that fire phase, but the SW is exempt from Cowering. See <a href="cha_cha15.htm#15.23" class="topiclink">15.23</a> for Hero usage.</p>
<p><a id="9.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.2 MULTIPLE ROF:</span> Each SW (or vehicular MA) MG has a number encased in a square to denote its Multiple ROF, and therefore may conceivably fire many times each Player Turn (whether separately or as part of a FG), depending on how long its operator engages each target. This time factor is abstractly represented by the Original colored dr of the MG's IFT-Resolution/TH-(<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.6" class="topiclink">9.6</a>) DR. If that colored dr is ≤ the MG's applicable ROF, the MG retains its Multiple ROF and may be fired again during that phase (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.15" class="topiclink">A.15</a>). However, during the MPh a DEFENDER MG cannot fire at the same unit in the same Location more times than the number of MF/MP expended by the target in that Location (FRD, but a minimum of once per hex). Once a MG has lost its Multiple ROF, it is marked with an appropriate Prep, First or Final Fire counter. Each MG in a multiple-MG FG retains or loses its own Multiple ROF based on the Original colored dr of the FG IFT DR (e.g., if a FG with a MMG and a LMG rolls a colored 2 dr on its IFT DR, the LMG has exhausted its Multiple ROF but the MMG has not). See also <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.41" class="topiclink">4.41</a> and <a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.12" class="topiclink">21.12-.13</a>.</p>
<p><img src="a92ex.gif" width="199" height="272" alt="a92ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The Russian MG in 1J5 Defensive First Fires with a -2 FFNAM/FFMO DRM on the squad and leader stack as they enter H6 from H7 at a cost of one MF. The result pins the leader, but the squad continues on into H5. Having retained Multiple ROF with a 1 on the Original colored dr of its IFT DR, the MG may fire again, but not on the pinned leader (unless it waits until Final Fire and is still not marked with a First Fire or Final Fire counter) because only one MF was expended in that hex. (If the pinned leader had expended two MF in entering H6 and thereby allowed another shot, the -2 FFNAM/ FFMO DRM would not apply to that second shot because the leader is now pinned; moreover, the MG would have to make its decision whether to continue firing at the pinned leader before the squad leaves the leader's hex, because thereafter the leader's MPh has ended and it is no longer subject to First Fire.) So the MG fires on the squad in H5 with a +2 DRM (-1 [FFNAM] +3 [TEM]) and breaks it while again rolling low enough on the colored dr of his IFT DR to retain its Multiple ROF. Because the now-broken squad expended two MF in entering H5, the MG may attack it once more (still with a -1 FFNAM DRM; <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.14" class="topiclink">8.14</a>) and does so—but this time loses its Multiple ROF and is marked with a First Fire counter. It cannot use Subsequent First Fire vs the broken squad because it has already fired on it twice and the unit had expended only two MF in its current Location. Should another unit move into the MG's CA (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>) within a two-hex range, the MG could use Subsequent First Fire (and thus Sustained Fire; <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">9.3</a>), but otherwise its attack opportunities are over for this Player Turn unless an enemy unit moves ADJACENT or into its current Location (see FPF; <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.31" class="topiclink">8.31</a>). The German MPh ends at this point, and the MG (not adjacent to an enemy unit) gets no Final Fire (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.4" class="topiclink">8.4</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="9.21"></a><img src="ca.gif" width="63" height="62" alt="CA" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9.21 FIELD OF FIRE:</span> Normally, a SW may fire in any direction with no detriment due to the facing of the counter. However, if a SW MMG/HMG in a woods/rubble/building hex fires and is entitled to another shot, it may continue to fire during that phase only inside the CA of the prior shot (which, unlike the CA of a Gun [<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">C3.2</a>], includes the MG's own Location regardless of the hexside [if any] crossed by the target unit entering that Location). If it fired up or down a stairwell within its same hex, its CA is defined vertically and subsequent shots during that phase (other than vs its own Location) are limited to the same direction up or down the staircase. If necessary, place a CA counter on the MG (or alternately two hexes away to relieve any congestion caused by stacking), pointing to the center hexspine of that CA as a reminder of its now-fixed CA. Remove the CA counter at the end of the current phase <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a SW MMG/HMG with a fixed CA, and whose operator was pinned in the PFPh/MPh, retains that fixed CA until the end of the DFPh]</span>. The restricted-CA principles of 9.21 also apply to SW of the INF, RCL and 20L ATR types.</p>

If he does declare a Fire Lane, he must place a First Fire counter on the MG and, after resolving that First Fire attack in the normal manner, must also place a Fire Lane Residual FP counter in one hex along a Hex Grain; that Hex Grain must include the MG's hex and its First Fire target hex, but he may place the Fire Lane counter in or beyond the latter hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: no Fire Lane is placed if the MG's manning Infantry Cowered, and/or used Subsequent-First-Fire (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">8.3-.31</a>)/FPF, during that initial First Fire attack]</span>. Fire Lane FG are NA; i.e., each MG must create a separate Fire Lane even if using the same Hex-Grain/IFT-DR as another. An illegally placed Fire Lane counter is removed, but the MG is still marked with a First Fire counter. Each Fire Lane Residual FP counter contains an ID letter to match the A-F ID letter of its MG counter, and should be placed so that the arrow points back along the Fire Lane Hex Grain to the firing MG.</p>
<p>A Fire Lane Residual FP counter exerts a unique form of Residual FP in its Location, and in every same-level (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">B.5</a>) Location of the Fire Lane Hex Grain between that counter and the MG, that is within the MG's Normal Range and in the LOS of its manning Infantry (when tracing their LOS to the hex center dot).

After resolving the attack with 8 FP and a 0 DRM (+1 [grain Hindrance] -1 [leadership]), the DEFENDER places a 2 FP Fire Lane counter in BB5 thereby leaving two Fire Lane Residual FP in Z4, AA5, and BB5 (plus 4 FP in Y4). In addition, the squad's FP leaves one normal Residual FP in AA5 (<a href="che_che8.htm#8.21" class="topiclink">8.21</a>; <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.26" class="topiclink">8.26</a>). A unit subsequently using non-Assault in AA5 will be attacked first (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.222" class="topiclink">9.222</a>) by the one Residual FP with a -1 DRM (FFNAM) and then by the Fire Lane's two residual FP with a -1 DRM (FFNAM) but the 4-6-7 cannot Subsequent First Fire against it (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.223" class="topiclink">9.223</a>).

A unit attacked by the four Fire Lane Residual FP in EE6 would receive a +1 wreck Hindrance DRM, while Infantry attacked in CC6 would receive a +1 wreck TEM. No Fire Lane Residual FP exists in DD5 because the 5-4-8's LOS to DDS's center dot is blocked by the woods in BBS. If the wreck were in DD5, its +1 Hindrance DRM would not apply vs a target in EE6 (<a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">D9.4</a>).

<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">A9.61 indicates that an MG TH vs. an AFV must be “without any form of halved FP penalty imposed”, given Ordnance is never halved, does that imply the halved FP penalty should be considered as if the MG was firing on the IFT instead? E.g. can a MG TH attempt target a concealed AFV? On the IFT normally the FP would be halved, but as ordnance case K applies instead. Or if the MG is pinned is a TH allowed?</span></p>

<p><a id="9.611"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.611 EFFECT vs PERSONNEL:</span> A MG making a normal IFT attack has no effect vs armor other than its effect on any Vulnerable PRC. However, a MG To Kill attack can also affect Vulnerable PRC of that AFV Collaterally (<a href="chd_chdintro.htm#.8a" class="topiclink">D.8A</a>).</p>
<p><a id="9.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.7 SUPPORT WEAPON (SW) MALFUNCTION:</span> Whenever a SW fires there is a chance it will jam or run out of ammunition. Each SW has an inherent B12 unless it has a Breakdown Number printed on its counter in the form &quot;B#&quot; or &quot;X#&quot;. Whenever a SW participates in an attack in which the Original IFT resolution DR (or To Hit DR in the case of ordnance weapons) is ≥ that SW's B#, that SW malfunctions and is inverted (or if the SW has an X#, the SW has permanently malfunctioned and is removed). The attack which caused the breakdown is still resolved <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: DC; <a href="cha_cha23.htm#23.4" class="topiclink">23.4</a>]</span> but no subsequent fire is allowed from that SW until it has been repaired (see <a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.11" class="topiclink">A.11</a>). A white &quot;X&quot; is superimposed over the nationality color of the malfunctioned side of a SW/Gun as a reminder that it is malfunctioned and subject to repair. A SW/Gun without this white X on its reverse side cannot be repaired or requires placement of a special Malfunction counter.</p>
<p><a id="9.71"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.71 MULTIPLE SW MALFUNCTION:</span> Should a FG containing two or more SW roll ≥ a B# when resolving its attack, at least one of the participating SW whose B# has been rolled will malfunction, but not necessarily all of them. Random Selection is used to determine the one(s) affected. This rule also applies to multiple MG and OVR attacks by the same AFV (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">D3.7</a>), as well as to multiple elimination due to rolling ≥ X#.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A FG contains a German HMG using Sustained Fire (thus a B# of 10 and an X# of 12 [<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.11" class="topiclink">A.11</a>]) and a LMG firing normally (B# of 12). If the Original IFT DR is a 10 or 11, the HMG automatically malfunctions. However, if the IFT DR is a 12, either the LMG malfunctions, the HMG is removed, or both—as determined by Random Selection.</span></p>
<p><a id="9.72"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.72 SW/GUN REPAIR:</span> Any Good Order unit may attempt to repair as many of its malfunctioned SW during any RPh as it can fire in one phase, by making a dr (∆) for each. If the Repair dr is ≤ the Repair Number listed on the back of the counter (in the form &quot;R#&quot;), the SW/Gun is repaired. A dr of 6 eliminates the SW/Gun; any other dr results in no change during that Player Turn. A captured SW/Gun may never be repaired unless recaptured by its original side. Only a crew (not a Temporary Crew) can attempt to repair a Gun, and not while hooked up.</p>
<p><a id="9.73"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.73 SW SELF-DESTRUCTION:</span> A SW/Gun/vehicular-weapon may be destroyed or deliberately malfunctioned (instead of firing it) by the unit or inherent crew possessing it during any PFPh/DFPh in which the weapon and possessing unit would otherwise still be allowed to fire it (see <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.4" class="topiclink">8.4</a> for DFPh restrictions). A unit/inherent crew may malfunction/destroy only as many weapons as it could fire were it not engaged in their malfunction/destruction. Such destruction counts as use of a SW.</p>
<p><a id="9.74"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.74 RANDOM SW/GUN DESTRUCTION:</span> When a Final KIA result occurs on the IFT <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: to determine Gun Destruction due to ordnance/bomb/DC/OBA; see <a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">C11.4-.52</a>]</span>, make a dr on the same column of the IFT for each SW/Gun possessed by the unit(s) eliminated by that KIA. Indirect Fire and OVR attacks can also destroy unpossessed weapons in the target hex. A -1 drm applies to the SW Destruction dr if the KIA was due to a fully-tracked AFV OVR, but no DRM carries over from the original KIA resolution. If the Final dr is a KIA, that SW/Gun is eliminated; if it is a K, that SW/Gun is malfunctioned (or eliminated if already malfunctioned). An overrunning, fully-tracked AFV which ends its MPh in a target Location may check for Random SW Destruction of unlimbered, NM, and RFNM (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.2" class="topiclink">C10.2-.26</a>) Guns and abandoned weapons even if the OVR did not result in a KIA unless the weapon is in an entrenchment. A fully-tracked AFV may make an OVR attack vs a Location devoid of Personnel to automatically destroy any Gun/SW therein not in an entrenchment, but must pay normal OVR MP costs. See <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.13" class="topiclink">11.13</a> for Random SW/Gun destruction occurring in CC.</p>

MG]</span> may have its PP halved (FRU) if in a dismantled state. A dm weapon is replaced with the appropriate dm SW counter. A weapon may be converted to an appropriate dm SW counter (or vice versa) by the unit possessing it during any PFPh/DFPh in which the weapon has not fired, but such conversion counts as use of that SW (including the use of all ROF). A unit may assemble/disassemble only as many weapons as it could fire were it not engaged in assembly/disassembly. 76-82mm mortars can be portaged by Infantry in the dm state at a cost of five PP apiece. A weapon may start a scenario dm at the owner's option <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if listed as dm it must start in that state]</span>. A malfunctioning weapon may be dismantled and transported, and repairs can be attempted while it is dm (using its normal, assembled R#). If captured, the captor may disassemble/reassemble a weapon as if it were his own. A mortar or MG Removed or Scrounged from a vehicle/wreck in which it was previously inherent armament is always removed as a dm SW if possible. A dm SW may not be fired until reassembled <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a German dm HMG/MMG may be fired as a German LMG</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.14" class="topiclink">14</a></span><span class="f_EXC">]</span>. Should a dm German HMG/MMG malfunction while firing as a LMG, it is marked with a MG Malfunction counter until repaired or removed (or assembled; in which case the inverted HMG/MMG counter can be used instead).</p>
