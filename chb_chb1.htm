<p><a id="1.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.1</span> &nbsp;Open Ground is any hex devoid of other printed terrain features which would affect fire or LOS into that hex. The most common form is any hex covered uniformly in light green such as 2B1. However, there are many other types of Open Ground hexes.</p>
<p><a id="1.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.11 ROADS:</span> The presence of a road modifies an Open Ground hex for movement purposes through a road hexside only. Otherwise, a road (such as 2W8) devoid of other terrain is considered an Open Ground hex.</p>
<p><a id="1.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.12 RUNWAY:</span> A runway hex is treated as Open Ground for most purposes with an additional TEM and prohibition against most Fortifications.</p>
<p><a id="1.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.13 SHELLHOLES:</span> Shellholes are treated as Open Ground only during Defensive First Fire and the RtPh, and only if the unit moving into them paid Open Ground entry costs as opposed to shellhole entry costs.</p>
<p><a id="1.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.14 HILLS:</span> Any hill hex devoid of other terrain is also an Open Ground hex. 2L4, 2L5, and 2K5 are examples of Open Ground hexes. However, the -1 FFMO DRM does not apply (due to the +1 TEM for Height Advantage) for most fire traced from a lower elevation, and therefore that hex is not considered unmodified Open Ground (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.531" class="topiclink">A10.531</a>) for that type of Interdiction claim unless the routing unit is crossing a Crest Line through the same hexside crossed by the firer's LOS (see <a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">10.31</a>).</p>
<p><a id="1.15"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.15 BRIDGES:</span> A bridge is considered Open Ground (actually a road) if the LOS of the firing/interdicting unit enters the bridge hex only through the road depiction of that bridge.</p>
<p><a id="1.16"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.16 HEXSIDES:</span> The presence of a wall, hedge, crest, or cliff hexside in an Open Ground hex does not change it from an Open Ground hex unless the LOS crosses that hexside. A FFNAM DRM and any hexside TEM are cumulative, but any beneficial TEM means the -1 FFMO DRM does not apply, thereby preventing any Interdiction attempt across a hexside TEM.</p>
<p><a id="1.17"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.17 ARTIFICIAL TERRAIN:</span> The placement of Artificial Terrain in (or along the LOS to) an Open Ground hex provides cumulative TEM or Hindrance bonuses which negate Interdiction and FFMO claims (even if using Road Movement rate).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A Defensive First Fire attack on a squad making an Assault Move into an Open Ground hex containing a wreck does not receive a negative DRM for FFMO (due to the TEM of the wreck) so it is entitled to a total TEM of +1.</span></p>
<p><a id="1.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.2 </span>Open Ground presents no obstruction or Hindrance to LOS, although those hexes which are also hills, or contain non-Open Ground hexsides or Artificial Terrain may, consistent with the rules for those other terrain types.</p>
<p><a id="1.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.3</span> The only TEM for Open Ground is the -1 FFMO DRM vs moving Infantry.</p>
