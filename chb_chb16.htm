<p><a id="16.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.1</span> A marsh represents pockets of alternating ankle-to-waist high water and swampy ground overgrown with vegetation. Any hex whose center dot is inside a dark bluish-green background containing black swamp symbols such as 7P6 or 13X7 is a marsh hex. Any unpossessed portaged equipment in a marsh hex is eliminated.</p>
<p><a id="16.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.2 </span> A marsh hex is a Hindrance to same-level LOS and causes a +1 DRM for every marsh hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">A6.7</a>]</span> between same-level target and firing hexes.</p>
<p><a id="16.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.3</span> A marsh hex has no TEM for fire traced into it, but because it is not Open Ground it negates Interdiction/FFMO for fire traced into it.</p>
<p><a id="16.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.31</span> Any HE attack into a marsh hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: vs a bridge or units on the bridge]</span> is halved due to the muffling effects of soft ground/water on the explosion.</p>
<p><a id="16.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.32</span> Only the inherent FP of Infantry, their LATW, any LMG, DC, FT or inherent SW may be used from a marsh hex and are resolved as Area Fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a unit on a bridge may fire from a marsh hex with no such detriment]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="16.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.4</span> Infantry/Cavalry may enter a marsh hex only at the cost of their entire MF allotment (inclusive of a broken unit's RtPh allotment); a marsh hex cannot be entered during the APh, nor can it be entered via Low Crawl (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.52" class="topiclink">A10.52</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC to all: along a bridge]</span>. Entry of a marsh hex from a lower elevation is a Minimum Move (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.134" class="topiclink">A4.134</a>).</p>
<p><a id="16.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.41</span> No non-amphibious vehicle, towed or pushed ordnance may enter a marsh hex unless on a bridge.</p>
<p><a id="16.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.42 &nbsp;AMPHIBIANS: </span>Amphibious vehicles may cross any hexside containing Open Ground/water/marsh into a marsh hex during the MPh as if it were entering a water hex, but must pay double the normal amphibious MP (<a href="chd_chd16.htm#16.2" class="topiclink">D16.2</a>) cost (i.e., two MP) to do so; such MP expenditure includes the cost of both the hexside terrain and of moving to a higher elevation. Boats cannot be used as conveyance in a marsh hex unless the hex has been flooded (<a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.6" class="topiclink">16.6</a>), in which case it is treated as a river hex.</p>
<p><a id="16.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.43 BOG:</span> Any ground level or level -1 hex adjacent to a marsh/mud-flat hex is a Bog hex requiring a Bog Check of any vehicle entering it along a non-road hexside <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.8" class="topiclink">16.8</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="16.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.5</span> No Fortifications are allowed in a marsh unless on a bridge (<a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.6" class="topiclink">6.6</a>).</p>
<p><a id="16.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.6 WATER DEPTH: </span>The scenario-defined water depth of a stream/river can alter the effects of a marsh. When a stream/river is flooded, all marsh hexes adjacent to or connected to the stream/river by a continuous string of marsh hexes are treated as stream/river hexes instead (<a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.43" class="topiclink">16.43</a> still applies as if they were Marsh). If the stream/river is dry/fordable respectively, they are treated as mudflats.</p>
<p><a id="16.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.7 &nbsp;MUDFLATS:</span> A mudflat is marsh with a lower water level. All marsh rules apply except where modified below.</p>
<p><a id="16.71"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.71</span> Infantry/Cavalry may enter a mudflat hex at a cost of two MF; <a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.4" class="topiclink">16.4</a> does not apply. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> Unpossessed portaged equipment in a mudflat is not lost.</p>
<p><a id="16.72"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.72 </span>Amphibious vehicles may not enter a mudflat in the water movement mode but must use land movement capabilities and roll for Bog instead and pay double Open Ground COT. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span></p>
<p><a id="16.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.8 WEATHER:</span> Marsh hexes are treated as Open Ground hexes during scenario-defined Snow, Deep Snow, or sub-zero temperatures (<a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.43" class="topiclink">16.43</a> does not apply).</p>
