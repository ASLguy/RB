<p><a id="20.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.1</span> A stream is a gully containing a small rivulet. A hex such as 13P4 containing a thin meandering blue line enclosed in a layered white, brown, and dark green background which extends through two hexsides of the hex is a stream hex. 13G4 and I6 are not stream hexes because the stream symbol crosses only one hexside therein. Non-stream remnants such as those in 22J0 and X10 do not block or impede Bypass movement of the J0-K1 hexside.</p>
<p><a id="20.2"></a>20.2 A stream is usually a level -1 Depression hex (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.3" class="topiclink">A6.3</a>), although it can exist at one level lower than that of any surrounding terrain. A unit IN a stream cannot see any other Depression hex unless it is ADJACENT and connected by a stream hexside, or the LOS can be drawn to another stream hex without leaving the layered blue-white-brown-dark green stream depiction. A flooded stream is usually level 0; see <a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.44" class="topiclink">20.44</a>.</p>

<p><a id="20.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.3</span> &nbsp;Barring other terrain in the hex, a stream is considered Open Ground for TEM and Rout purposes, provided a LOS to it exists (see bridge; <a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.32" class="topiclink">6.32</a>).</p>
<p><a id="20.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.4 DEPTH:</span> The depth of water in a stream is the only thing which distinguishes it from a gully hex. A stream may be defined as one of four types: dry, shallow, deep, or flooded. If undefined by SSR, a stream is considered to be shallow. In DYO scenarios where this information is unknown, it can be resolved with a single dr as per the following chart. This dr is modified by the current EC drm (<a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.5" class="topiclink">25.5</a>).</p>

<p><a id="20.44"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.44 &nbsp;FLOODED:</span> If a stream is flooded, it is one level higher than it would normally be (i.e., usually level 0), and is treated as a flooded pond. All mapboard-depicted ponds in a scenario that has a flooded stream are also one level higher than normal, as per <a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.21" class="topiclink">21.21</a>. See <a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.6" class="topiclink">16.6</a> for a flooded stream's effect on marsh.</p>

If a non-dry stream is not frozen, but snow is present, the stream is a frigid Water Obstacle. If Infantry/Cavalry units enter a frigid Water Obstacle without a bridge they are Replaced by the next lower Class unit or Disrupted as per <a href="cha_cha19.htm#19.12" class="topiclink">A19.12-.13</a> or Casualty Reduced if incapable of both Replacement and Disruption (e.g., heroic or unarmed units). Any boat capable of conveying that size unit can be used to cross a frigid stream at the normal MF cost of the Passenger for entry of that type of stream. There are no loading/unloading costs or other boat rules to consider when crossing a stream unless it is flooded.</p>

Fords are not printed on the mapboard, but are represented by ford counters which can be placed on a stream or gully hex only by SSR.</p>
<p><a id="20.81"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.81</span> &nbsp;Movement into a ford stream hex from any direction is treated as if the water depth were one classification shallower (dry rather than shallow; deep rather than flooded).</p>
<p><a id="20.82"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.82</span> Movement from a ford hex does not require a Bog DR even if the move is across a higher level hexside, but does require the normal additional MF/MP costs if moving to a higher elevation.</p>

One Crest counter may service all units in a hex or multiple Crest counters can be placed in a hex to allow different units Crest status in different directions.</p>

<p><a id="20.91"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.91 </span>Any Good Order Infantry already IN a Depression may (if capable of Advance) claim Crest status in that same hex during its APh by remaining in the same hex and placing a Crest counter beneath it, or by expending two MF in its MPh to do so. Good Order Infantry outside a Depression may claim Crest status in the Depression hex it enters along the hexside it enters by expending one less MF than the normal COT of that hex but its Crest counter must be placed so that the middle of the three hexsides it could conceivably protect is the hexside it crossed. Therefore, this option could not be used when entering a Depression via a Depression hexside. Units may begin a scenario already set up in Crest status. Infantry in Crest status are considered entrenched one level higher than the Depression against all Direct Fire attacks across any of the front three hexsides of that Depression hex (as identified by placement of the Crest counter) which are not crossed by a Depression hexside. Crest counters must be placed so that the middle of the three hexsides it could conceivably protect does not cover a hexside intersected by the Depression terrain. Once placed, a Crest counter cannot be altered until it is removed.</p>

All fire traced INTO a Depression hex affects units both IN the Depression and units in Crest status in the same hex with the same DR. However, same-level, non-adjacent Direct Fire which is valid against Crest status Infantry does not affect units IN that Depression.</p>

The 4-6-7 can see the 5-4-8 in R3 but only because both are in Crest status; if either or both were IN their respective hexes they could not see each other because of the intervening ground level terrain along the S3-S4 hexside which would block their LOS.

Crest Infantry may exit the Depression hex to a non-Depression hex along the same side of the Depression which they occupy as if they were leaving a foxhole (one MF &amp; COT or normal APh capability).

<p><a id="20.94"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.94 FIRE/CC:</span> Crest Infantry firing at any target not within their protected Crest front must fire as Area Fire. Crest Infantry in CC are subject to a -2 DRM for all attacks against them and a +2 DRM for any attacks they make (unless the attackers had just entered the hex through a protected Crest hexside), but if they survive their initial round of CC, they must immediately drop their Crest status if held in Melee.</p>
<p><a id="20.95"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.95 &nbsp;SW:</span> Other than their inherent FP, a Crest infantry unit may fire only LMG, DC, LATW, FT/inherent SW. Any unpossessed SW previously in Crest status falls INTO the Depression hex.</p>
<p><a id="20.96"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.96 &nbsp;BROKEN UNITS:</span> If broken, Crest Infantry must leave their Crest status during the following RtPh.</p>
<p><a id="20.97"></a><span class="f_Strong">20.97 &nbsp;FORTIFICATIONS:</span> Fortifications in a Depression hex are assumed to be IN the Depression rather than in Crest status.</p>
