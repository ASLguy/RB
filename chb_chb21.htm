<p><a id="21.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.1</span> A Water Obstacle is a body of water large enough to stop the normal movement of men and vehicles, which cannot enter without special assistance. Any non-stream hex whose center dot is emplaced in a blue background is a Water Obstacle hex. There are four types of Water Obstacles—all of which have very similar characteristics.</p>

<p>Place the Current counter in a river hex proper side up as a constant reminder of prevailing Current conditions. Current does not affect bridges or any river hex bordered on opposite sides by non-island ground (marsh inclusive) hexes (EX: 7CC4, 7K2, 7H1). Current affects fording Infantry only in that it defines &quot;downstream&quot;. Both moderate and heavy currents affect boats and amphibious vehicles, except during the Player Turn in which they are launched or landed; slow current has no effect. Boats and amphibious units IN a river hex with moderate current must drift one hex downstream during their APh; in a heavy current they drift one hex during each APh. If there is more than one adjacent downstream hex to drift to, power boats and non-Immobile amphibious vehicles may choose the drift hex if manned by non-broken/shocked/stunned PRC. The drift hex of all paddled or abandoned boats, and abandoned or shocked/stunned/immobilized amphibians, is determined by dr: 1-3 lower hex coordinate, 4-6 higher hex coordinate. A unit does not drift into/out of marsh.</p>
<p><a id="21.122"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.122 DEPTH:</span> At the outset of any river scenario the depth should be defined as fordable, deep, or flooded. If fordable, Infantry units may attempt to ford without use of boats. Wrecks appear IN water hexes only in fordable rivers. If undefined by SSR, a river is considered to be deep. In DYO scenarios where this information is not known it can be resolved with a dr. ≤ 1 = flooded, 2-5 = deep, ≥ 6 = fordable. This dr is modified by the current EC drm (<a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.5" class="topiclink">25.5</a>). A flooded river transforms adjacent marsh to river terrain (<a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.6" class="topiclink">16.6</a>); a fordable river transforms such marsh to mudflats (<a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.7" class="topiclink">16.7</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="21.13"></a><img src="b2113.jpg" width="489" height="115" alt="b2113" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">21.13 &nbsp;POND:</span> A pond for game purposes is essentially a land-locked river, lacking the natural flow patterns of a river because it is surrounded by land on all sides. 7CC9 and 17N7 are examples of a pond hex. No dr is made to determine the depth of a pond; <a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.2" class="topiclink">21.2</a> applies instead. A pond can exist without containing a hex center dot (such as the one in 24L9-M9), but in this case the hex is not considered a Water Obstacle hex (although the pond hexside is a Water Obstacle) and can be entered across any non-all-water hexside. An amphibious vehicle attempting to cross any all-water hexside into a non-Water Obstacle hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: marsh; <a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.42" class="topiclink">16.42</a>]</span> must expend one amphibious mode MP plus the normal non-amphibious MP cost of that hex. Wrecks appear in a pond only if it is defined by SSR as fordable.</p>
<p><a id="21.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.14 LAKE/OCEAN:</span> A lake/ocean is a body of water so large that it extends unimpeded across the entire length of a mapboard and covers that mapboard edge with Water Obstacle hexes.</p>
<p><a id="21.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.2</span> All Water Obstacles are one level beneath the surrounding terrain (usually level -1), so a Crest Line is formed where a Water Obstacle hex meets a ground level or higher terrain feature <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.21" class="topiclink">21.21</a>]</span>. Therefore a unit IN a Water Obstacle hex may trace a LOS into only the initial hex of each level above it; however, this LOS can be blocked by other LOS requirements (such as distance from a Crest Line; <a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.23" class="topiclink">10.23</a>). Similarly, a unit on a higher level may trace a LOS INTO a Water Obstacle hex only if between it and the Water Obstacle hex, there are no other intervening hexsides (other than its own) of equal or higher elevation to it.</p>
<p><a id="21.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.21</span> If a river is defined as flooded it is one level higher than normal (i.e., usually level 0). All ponds in a scenario that has a flooded river are also one level higher than normal. Such increases in the level of a Water Obstacle (or stream; <a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.44" class="topiclink">20.44</a>) do not prohibit normal movement under a bridge (<a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.4" class="topiclink">21.4</a>) in that water hex.</p>
<p><img src="b213ex.gif" width="196" height="200" alt="b213ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: 7AA10 would have to be at level 1 or higher to give it a view INTO the river through AA9. However, if the river were defined as flooded, both AA8 and BB9 would be at ground level (and BB8 would be considered a river hex; <a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.6" class="topiclink">16.6</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="21.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.3 </span>Provided a LOS to it exists, a Water Obstacle is considered Open Ground for TEM and Rout purposes (see bridges; <a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.32" class="topiclink">6.32</a>).</p>
<p><a id="21.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.4</span> Entrance of a Water Obstacle hex is usually limited to units on a bridge, boat, or amphibious vehicle. Otherwise, entrance is limited to swimming or fording by Personnel units. The rules for swimming and boats are highly specialized and therefore described separately in Chapter <a href="che_cheintro.htm" class="topiclink">E</a>.</p>
<p><a id="21.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.41 FORDING:</span> Fording may be attempted by Infantry/Cavalry only in river hexes defined as both fordable and non-frigid. Pushing motorcycles/Guns is not allowed while fording. Entrance of such a hex costs the unit's entire MF allotment and is considered Hazardous Movement for as long as the unit is in that hex. There is no penalty for leaving a Water Obstacle hex other than the doubling of MF for each higher elevation entered <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Abrupt Elevation Change; <a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">10.5</a>]</span>. Fording units may not move upstream directly against a heavy current. Fording units are immune to Pin effects. A Water Obstacle cannot be entered (via fording) during the APh, but can be left in the APh. Mortars, MMG, and HMG must be dm to be portaged by fording Infantry/Cavalry.</p>
