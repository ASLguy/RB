<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">23. BUILDINGS</span></h1>
<p><a id="23.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.1</span> Buildings represent man-made dwellings of various sizes, shapes, and construction. Any hex containing one or more brown or gray rectangular overview building depictions is a building hex—even if the hex center dot does not touch that building depiction.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="b231ex.gif" width="202" height="121" alt="b231ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: 1M4 is a building hex. M5 is also a building hex but is part of the same building as N3, N4, and N5 because all four building hexes are connected by building hexsides. Unless reference is specifically made to a &quot;hex&quot; of a building, reference to building M5 also includes hexes N3, N4, and N5.</span></p>
<p><a id="23.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.2</span> A building is an obstacle to LOS, and its elevation is dependent on the combination of its height and the elevation level it occupies. For example, a Single Story House on a level 0 hex is a level 1 obstacle; a Single Story House in a valley is a level 0 obstacle; and a Single Story House on a level 2 hill is a level 3 obstacle. The height of the building itself is based solely on the number of hexes it occupies and the presence or absence of a stairwell symbol within the building. A stairwell symbol is the small white square which replaces the hex center dot of some building hexes. Remember that either the firing or target unit needs an elevation advantage over the height equivalent of any obstacle to see past that obstacle to a lower level, but an intervening same-level obstacle never blocks the LOS of same-level units.</p>
<p><a id="23.21"></a><img src="b2321.jpg" width="479" height="116" alt="b2321" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">23.21 SINGLE STORY HOUSE:</span> All single hex buildings which do not contain a staircase symbol are considered one level obstacles to LOS. All units in such buildings are at the level of the other terrain in the hex. 1D4 is an example of a Single Story House.</p>
<p><a id="23.211"></a><img src="b23211.jpg" width="476" height="116" alt="b23211" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">23.211 LUMBERYARD:</span> Any hex containing numerous brown rectangular striped shapes is a lumberyard hex. Hex 24Q6 (and cD4 of Deluxe ASL) is an example of a lumberyard hex. A lumberyard is considered identical to a wooden Single Story House in all respects except for Rout (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">A10.51</a>), Rally (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.61" class="topiclink">A10.61</a>), Victory Conditions (<a href="cha_cha26.htm" class="topiclink">A26</a>), <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> and EC DRM for Kindling/Spreading (<a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.5" class="topiclink">25.5</a>) purposes, the ability to fire mortars and AA Guns therefrom, and the hex may not be OVR by vehicles. Vehicles may enter a lumberyard only via Bypass <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: motorcycles may be pushed]</span>. Paths never exist through a lumberyard.</p>
<p><img src="b2322.jpg" width="416" height="140" alt="b2322" style="border:none" /></p>

<p><a id="23.22"></a><img src="b2322.gif" width="137" height="99" alt="b2322" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">23.22 TWO STORY HOUSE:</span> &nbsp;A multi-hex building which contains no stairwell symbol is considered a 1½ level obstacle to LOS despite also having another vertical level in each hex besides the ground level in the form of a level 1 capacity. All buildings of this type have an inherent stairwell present in each hex to allow movement between levels. Units on a Level 1 counter are considered to be at a level one higher than the surrounding terrain even though the building itself is only 1½ levels higher than the surrounding terrain. 1F1-G1 is an example of a two story house.</p>

Such buildings have no inherent stairwells other than those represented by the white square stairwell symbol. Movement between levels inside the building may only be accomplished in a stairwell hex. 1U3 is an example of a multi-story building.</p>
<p><a id="23.24"></a><img src="lvl3.gif" width="70" height="72" alt="LVL3" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">23.24 THIRD LEVEL STRUCTURES:</span> A building with three levels constitutes a 3½ level obstacle, exists only by SSR, and is identified thereafter by placement of a Level 3 counter on an appropriate hex. The Level 3 height can apply to either the entire Building or a specific hex of that building as specified by SSR. If a SSR or the building itself does not specify the presence of a stairwell, each hex of the building containing a third level Location is assumed to contain an inherent stairwell.</p>
<p><a id="23.25"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.25 ADJACENT BUILDING HEXES:</span> A unit in a building is ADJACENT to an adjacent building level of the same building only if both are either on the same level <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Rowhouse; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.71" class="topiclink">23.71</a>]</span>, or are vertically connected by a stairwell (printed or inherent). Otherwise, no LOS exists between adjacent units in the same building, nor does a LOS exist between non-adjacent units in the same building, unless a LOS clear of the building depiction can be traced through intervening hex(es)—such as from 1M5 to N3 (see <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.1" class="topiclink">23.1</a> illustration). &nbsp;LOS to a unit in a building Location <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: rooftop Location]</span> can exist only if drawn to an ADJACENT unit or (for LOS between different hexes) if the LOS as it enters the hex does not cross a hexside within the building depiction (e.g., in contrast to 1X3/1X4). <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span></p>
<p><img src="b2325ex.gif" width="135" height="121" alt="b2325ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The ground level of 1X3 is not in the LOS of the 1st level of W4. Therefore, the broken unit in level 1 of W4 is under no obligation to rout despite the presence of the enemy unit in X3. Similarly, units in those adjacent hexes cannot fire at each other due to their lack of LOS.</span></p>
<p><a id="23.26"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.26 STAIRWELL:</span> Attacks up or down a stairwell hex to other vertical levels of the same building hex are limited to the next higher or lower level. A ground level and second (or higher) level of the same building hex are never ADJACENT.</p>
<p><a id="23.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.3</span> The TEM of a building is dependent on the construction type of that building. Gray buildings represent stone construction and have a TEM of +3. Brown buildings represent wooden construction and have a TEM of +2. If the color of a particular building is such that players cannot agree on the construction type of that building, treat it as wooden.</p>
<p><a id="23.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.31</span> The TEM is determined by the building occupied by the target and is not altered for fire from within the same building <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Factory; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.741" class="topiclink">23.741</a>]</span>. A Bypassing unit does not qualify for a building TEM vs non-Residual-FP <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chj_chapj.htm#2.23" class="topiclink">J2.23</a>]</span> attacks.</p>
<p><a id="23.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.32 INDIRECT FIRE:</span> Indirect Fire is resolved simultaneously with the same Original Resolution DR vs each level of a building (provided it is not an Interior Building Hex), but there is an additional +1 DRM for each non-rooftop level of the building above it (even if in the Marketplace [<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.73" class="topiclink">23.73</a>], or if being attacked by WP); if an Interior Building Hex is hit, only the rooftop and highest level of that building hex are affected <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Rubble; <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.11" class="topiclink">24.11-. 121</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">]</span>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A unit on the ground level of a wooden Two Story House receives a +3 TEM vs indirect Fire; a unit on Level 1 of a stone Multi-Story Building receives a +4 TEM.</span></p>
<p><a id="23.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.4</span> Unless using Bypass, Infantry spend two MF to enter a building hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: via Road (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.132" class="topiclink">A4.132</a>); also, if the Bypass portion of the hex contains other than Open Ground such as 2I9 (<a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.4" class="topiclink">A2.4</a>)]</span> and one MF to change levels within a building in a stairwell hex (whether printed or inherent). A vehicle may enter a building hex only via VBM (D2.3), Factory Stairwell (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.742" class="topiclink">23.742</a>), or by risking rubble/cellar collapse (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.41" class="topiclink">23.41</a>) <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: Marketplace; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.73" class="topiclink">23.73</a>]</span>, and may never occupy an upper building level.</p>
<p><a id="23.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.41 CELLARS:</span> Only a fully-tracked, CT, BU AFV without Riders may enter a building obstacle <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Marketplace (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.73" class="topiclink">23.73</a>); Factory Stairwell (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.742" class="topiclink">23.742</a>)]</span> and does so at a total MP cost equal to half of its printed MP allotment (plus the additional one-fourth of its MP allotment if it makes an OVR attack; <a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.1" class="topiclink">D7.1</a>). Such non-VBM entry of a building hex requires an immediate Bog Check DR with a +3 DRM to the Bog Check only (+4 for stone buildings). If the AFV rolls ≤ 0 on the colored dr of the Bog Check DR, the building hex has been rubbled. A -1 drm to the colored dr of the Bog Check DR applies if the building is wooden/a Single Story House (per each applicable case) only for purposes of determining rubble creation. Rubbling a Single Story House has no effect upon any occupants of the building, but if a rubbled building has an upper level, <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.11" class="topiclink">24.11-.121</a> applies. If the AFV rolls an Original 6 on the colored dr of the Bog Check DR, the AFV has fallen through the floor to the cellar and is removed. Should the AFV crew survive, it is automatically placed at ground level subject to Hazardous Movement for any subsequent fire during that phase (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>). Cellars have no other use in the game. An AFV falling into a cellar does not in itself create rubble, nor does it have any effect on Manholes, sewers, or units therein.</p>

The floor remains inherently present despite the absence of the Level counter. The Level counter is used only to show units or that specific upper level.

As a multi-hex building, Rowhouses have an upper level(s) and are considered either 1½ level obstacles to LOS if they have only an inherent stairwell (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.22" class="topiclink">23.22</a>) such as 20X6, or 2½ level obstacles if they have a printed stairwell (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.23" class="topiclink">23.23</a>) such as 12O4. The thick black bar blocks all LOS through it at all levels <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Rowhouse rooftop units retain their normal LOS]</span>. Rubble has no effect on this black bar unless both hexes formed by that hexside are rubbled, in which case it ceases to exist. Infantry in a Rowhouse may move/rout/advance/Withdraw-from-CC directly into another Rowhouse hex of the same building only at the ground or Rooftop (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.8" class="topiclink">23.8</a>) level; if at the ground level they must specify which side of the building they are &quot;bypassing&quot;. Such units moving/routing on the ground level expend three MF (one to &quot;bypass&quot; in the hex it is leaving where it would be attacked by any OBA/Residual-FP and two to enter the building), and can be Interdicted or Defensive First Fired upon with FFMO/FFNAM DRM by any unit capable of doing so that can trace a LOS to the vertex of the hexside crossed by the moving/routing unit on that side of the building. If broken, pinned, or repulsed at this vertex, the unit is returned to its last-occupied Location as if it had attempted to enter a concealed MMC's Location during its MPh (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.15" class="topiclink">A12.15</a>). A ground-level move/rout/advance/Withdrawal of this type is vulnerable to any mines in either hex. Units in different Rowhouses may not form a FG unless each is ADJACENT to another unit that is not in a Rowhouse but that is part of that FG. Each hex of a Rowhouse building is always considered a separate building for Rout and Mopping Up purposes but not for Building Control.</p>

Routing up a level in I7 would save it temporarily but leave it very vulnerable to the next German move, so it elects to rout to H6 on the other side of the building because neither German unit has a LOS to the I7-I6-H6 vertex along the I6 side of the building to H6.</span></p>

The same is true for multi-hex buildings located on different elevation levels and having no stairwell symbol, whether a Rowhouse (41V6-V7) or regular two story house (overlay 6). Movement within the building from the higher hex to the lower hex must be made from a building level which is one lower than the building level moved into and vice versa; units on rooftops cannot move directly into a new hex. Movement between Rowhouse hexes of the same split level building can occur only at ground level; if ascending elevation, Infantry would spend 4 MF (two [2 x 1] to &quot;bypass&quot; and two to enter the building).

A DC may be Placed on a Fortified Building Location without attempting to Breach it at the normal building entry COT, even if the Placing unit could not enter the Location due to it being Fortified.</p>
<p><a id="23.93"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.93 &nbsp;GUNS:</span> A Fortified Building differs from a building in that any ART/AT/INF Guns ≤ 76mm may set up in the fortified upper levels of a multi-level stone Fortified Building. Such a weapon cannot be moved from that Location during play. See <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.6" class="topiclink">C2.6</a> for the minimum distance at which such a Gun can fire at a different-level target. Any type/target size of Gun may set up in the ground level of a Fortified Building but may not fire at Aerial targets or use Indirect Fire. No ⅝&quot; weapon counter may be moved into a Fortified Building during play.</p>
