Before normally resolving the HE attack against any affected occupants, make a subsequent dr, adding a +1 drm if the building is of stone construction. If the result is ≤ the KIA# of the Original DR, that building level (and all levels above it in that hex) has been rubbled. This is indicated by placement of a rubble counter on top of the proper Level counter to show that the lower levels still exist. If the building Location is not rubbled, use the Original IFT DR and any applicable DRM to resolve the attack on the target. The level affected in an Area-Target-Type/OBA attack vs a multi-level building is determined via Random Selection among those levels hit. All un-armored occupants (including SW) of a rubbled building level are eliminated (see <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.121" class="topiclink">24.121</a> for effects on an AFV). Even if the KIA occurs in a higher building level, there is still a possibility that the entire building will collapse. Roll one die. On a dr ≥ 6 the entire building hex is rubbled. There is a +1 drm for every non-rooftop building level above the one in which the rubble occurred.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A Brummbaer attacks a 4-4-7 in a stone building and scores a hit on the Infantry Target Type with its 150mm Gun. The Original IFT DR is a 3 which results in a 3KIA. The building is stone (+1 drm) so the German must roll a 1 or 2 on a subsequent dr to rubble that Location; if he makes an Original dr ≥ 3, no rubble results and he must resolve the Original IFT DR as a 3KIA result vs the 4-4-7 instead. Had the attack been a 150mm FFE, the result would have been the same except that a +3 TEM would have applied after the building failed to rubble, resulting in a K/4 vs the 4-4-7.</span></p>

<p><a id="24.121"></a><span class="f_Strong">24.121</span> Falling rubble transforms any non-Water Obstacle terrain it falls on into a rubble counter at ground level and eliminates any non-armored (including non-AFV wrecks) or OT AFV unit/Fortification/TB in that hex. Each surviving armored unit must immediately check for Bog (even if its Bog Check caused that rubble; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.41" class="topiclink">23.41</a>). A CE, CT AFV is also Stunned (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.34" class="topiclink">D5.34</a>). It is possible that falling rubble can fall into another building hex (even a higher one), rubbling it, and thereby start a chain reaction of such collapses. The movement costs and TEM of rubble replace whatever terrain was previously present <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: bridges remain intact but with a rubble counter on top]</span>. See <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.6" class="topiclink">24.6</a> for Falling Rubble vs Flame/Blaze.</p>
<p><a id="24.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">24.2</span> Ground level rubble is a Half-Level LOS obstacle through the entire hex (including hexsides but without negating any hedge/wall). Rubble at a higher building level is a LOS obstacle equivalent to a half level plus that of the highest non-rubbled level beneath it, but only within the building depiction outline in that hex at upper levels. The ground level of any hex containing upper level rubble is assumed to be covered with rubble throughout the hex, although it does not harm units at ground level when it occurs and units may cross the ground level hex through a connecting (non-rubble) building hexside at non-rubble movement rates. Rubble falling into a hex already containing uncleared rubble has no additional effect other than the danger it poses to the occupants of that hex (24.121). A combination gully-rubble hex is a LOS obstacle at both its Crest (<a href="chb_chb19.htm" class="topiclink">19</a>.) and Depression levels <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: rubbled bridge; <a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.331" class="topiclink">6.331</a>]</span>. A unit IN such a hex must expend four MF to enter Crest status in that hex (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.91" class="topiclink">20.91</a>). A Crest unit in such a hex always receives rubble TEM—not entrenchment benefits. All other Crest rules apply unchanged.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="b242ex.gif" width="182" height="200" alt="b242ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The 4-6-7 on Level 2 of 20H3 can see directly along the H2-I3 hexside to I2 due to the ground level rubble in H2 despite the H2-I3 hexside still being a two level obstacle, because a LOS must be obstructed on both sides of the thread to be blocked unless it is Inherent Terrain—which the I3 building is not (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">A6.1</a>). However, a unit at ground level in H3 could not be seen from I2 because the rubble is a Half-Level Obstacle and, even though the LOS is traced exactly along a hexside, the H2 rubble and I3 building form a continuous obstacle (albeit of varying height) across that hexside. Now assume that the rubble in H2 was at level one. A unit in I2 would have to pay three MF to enter H2, but a unit at ground level in G3, H3, or I3 would only have to pay two MF to enter H2.</span></p>

The units involved must have declared their Clearance task as Hazardous Movement by expending ALL of their MF to enter (or remain in) the hex during their MPh and being marked with a TI counter. A bulldozer may enter a rubble hex without checking for Bog and make a Clearance attempt provided it expends its entire printed MP allotment (other than for Starting/changing-VCA) to enter/remain-in the hex, is not using Reverse/ESB, and becomes TI. A cleared rubble hex is marked with a TB counter across any two hexsides of the rubble hex of the clearing player's choice. A TB counter reduces movement costs into that hex through the TB hexside to its pre-rubble status cost. The TB has no effect on LOS or TEM of that hex (see <a href="chb_chb13.htm#13.4212" class="topiclink">13.4212</a>). If every hexside of the rubble hex is crossed by a TB, the rubble and the TB are removed.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: One squad, a bulldozer, and a 9-1 leader engaged solely in rubble clearance throughout their entire Player Turn can create a TB through the rubble hex with an Original DR ≤ 9 because they qualify for a -7 DRM (-5 [bulldozer] -1 [squad] -1 [leadership] = -7).</span></p>

If more than one Flame counter exists in a Location, each must be cleared separately with its own separate DR, although all extinguishing units may attempt to put out each Flame. A Blaze cannot be extinguished by Clearance attempts. An extinguished Flame leaves the terrain in its pre-Fire condition.</p>
<p><a id="24.721"></a><span class="f_Strong">24.721 HAMPER: </span>A Final Fire Clearance DR of 3-6 prevents a Flame from becoming a Blaze during that Player Turn. A Hampered Flame is signified by placement beneath a PIN counter.</p>

However, any Original Minefield Clearance DR of 12 (11 or 12 if Inexperienced) results in Casualty Reduction vs the clearing unit(s). If successful, the minefield hex is marked with a TB counter across any two hexsides of the ATTACKER's choice (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.61" class="topiclink">28.61</a>). If every hexside of the minefield hex is crossed by a TB, the mines and TB are removed. Good Order Infantry may enter a Known minefield hex free of minefield attack by placing a partial TB, provided they expend their entire MF allotment to do so, become TI, and attempt to clear the minefield at the end of their CCPh. Unless the minefield is cleared, these units may exit the minefield free of minefield attack only by the hexside through which they entered. No other units may use the partial TB. The partial TB counter is removed if they are eliminated or exit the hex. See also <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">28.62-.8</a>.</p>

If it attempts that same DR again it may add the -1 Labor Status DRM to its DR even if joined by new units. If it fails another DR of the same type, the Labor counter is flipped to its -2 DRM side which will then be applicable to future attempts. Once earned, a Labor counter remains in place until the Task is achieved or all MMC beneath it are eliminated or removed from their current Location. A Labor Status DRM is applicable only to the specific Task attempt for which the Labor counter was placed.</p>
