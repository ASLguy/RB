<p><a id="28.413"></a><span class="f_Strong">28.413 ROUT:</span> A routing unit need not move through a known A-P minefield hex and may opt to take a longer route to a building/woods hex instead. However, if a broken squad is Reduced to a broken HS by minefield attack, that HS may continue its rout in the same RtPh at its option. Should a routing unit also be subject to Interdiction, the Interdiction would be resolved after any minefield attack.</p>
<p><a id="28.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">28.42 VEHICLES:</span> Vehicles entering or leaving an A-P minefield hex also undergo attack on the IFT. A-P minefield attacks are always resolved before A-T minefield attacks, and if they result in Immobilization they cancel any yet-to-be resolved A-T minefield attack vs the same vehicle. Unarmored vehicles use the ★ Vehicle line of the IFT normally. Armored vehicles do not use the ★ Vehicle line but are unaffected by minefield attacks resulting in other than a KIA; a KIA result immobilizes an AFV. There is no armor modifier to a minefield attack, but any AFV whose lowest hull AF is 0 or whose side and rear are unarmored is treated as an unarmored vehicle for purposes of any type of minefield attack.</p>
<p><a id="28.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">28.43 PRC:</span> PRC are immune to minefield attacks unless their vehicle is eliminated or immobilized. If their vehicle is eliminated, the PRC roll for survival normally. If their vehicle is immobilized, any Vulnerable PRC are attacked Collaterally (all PRC of an unarmored vehicle [including those with a 0 hull AF] are considered Vulnerable to minefield attacks). PRC which disembark or Bail Out into an A-P Minefield hex must undergo minefield attack as if they were entering that hex for the first time.</p>
<p><a id="28.44"></a><span class="f_Strong">28.44 MINEFIELDS IN BUILDING/TRENCH HEXES:</span> Minefields are allowed in non-Interior Building Hexes but do not attack units entering/exiting those hexes through a building hexside unless using Bypass Movement. Neither would mines attack units using Trench movement, or using a Tower's stairwell.</p>
<p><a id="28.45"></a><img src="b2845.gif" width="117" height="59" alt="b2845" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">28.45 KNOWN MINEFIELDS:</span> Due to the often mobile nature of the war in North Africa, minefields were usually well marked so friendly troops would not accidentally enter them. Hence, special minefield counters have been included in WEST OF ALAMEIN. These are termed Known Minefield counters, and treated as normal mines except as specified otherwise. Known Minefield counters have the normal depiction on the front but list no attack strength; the reverse side has the same but with the strength shown. When Known Minefields are called for in any scenario, during his setup the owner places the desired number of these counters onboard (with their strength-side down). Once the strength of such a counter has been revealed, it is flipped over. Known Minefield counters may represent minefields previously discovered by reconnaissance or in a previous engagement; therefore, Known Minefields are set up onboard even in night scenarios. If a Known Minefield counter has its strength reduced or eliminated by OBA/Bomb attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">28.62</a>), that counter is replaced by one having the appropriate new strength (or by a Dummy Minefield counter [<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.47" class="topiclink">28.47</a>] if its strength was eliminated); if its strength was unrevealed at the time, its new strength remains unrevealed. Known Minefield factors may not be exchanged for booby trap capability, nor may Known A-P mines be exchanged for any type of A-T mines or vice-versa. The use of Known mines is not restricted to any type of board/scenario. Known minefield factors have the same BPV as hidden mines, and are indicated on the DYO Purchase Roster by adding &quot;Kn&quot; in the 'TYPE&quot; column of &quot;Fortifications&quot; section where the purchase was recorded.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A player whose OB contains 24 Known minefield factors may set up two Known Minefield counters with 12 factors each, or three of 8 factors each, or four with 6 factors each, or two with 6 factors each plus one with 12 factors, etc.</span></p>
<p><a id="28.46"></a><img src="b2846.jpg" width="146" height="62" alt="b2846" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">28.46</span> A second type of Known Minefield counter contains an arrow. Whenever a player wishes to have a multi-hex Known minefield along a Hex Grain (or Alternate Hex Grain), he may place two such counters along it with the arrow on each counter pointing towards the other in the same manner as if they were Barrage counters (<a href="che_che12.htm#12.11" class="topiclink">E12.11</a>), but with no limit to the number of hexes allowed between them. Such placement indicates that each hex between (and inclusive of) them along that (Alternate) Hex Grain contains a Known minefield. The type(s) and strength(s) of mines (if any; <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.7" class="topiclink">28.47</a>) in each such hex must still be recorded. A hex containing Known mines can incorporate only one A-P/A-T minefield, regardless of how many multi-hex Known minefields that hex is part of.</p>

When the opponent discovers that it is a Dummy (which must be announced when any ground unit enters, or successfully Searches [<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.152" class="topiclink">A12.152</a>], its Location), simply remove it from play <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if an unmined hex is thusly discovered in a minefield laid out as per </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.46" class="topiclink">28.46</a></span><span class="f_Emphasis">, mark that hex with a Dummy Minefield counter]</span>. A Dummy minefield is unaffected by a K/KIA resulting from bomb/OBA attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">28.62</a>). The number that may appear beneath a Dummy Minefield counter depiction in a printed scenario OB represents the number of Dummy counters allotted. In a scenario that does not allot Dummy minefields (which includes all DYO scenarios), a player may add (at no extra BPV cost) one Dummy Minefield counter to his OB for every 24 Known minefield factors he sets up. In addition, in any scenario in which a player has received ≥ one Dummy Minefield counter, he may make a Secret dr (halved; FRD) and receives an additional number of Dummy mine counters equal to that result.</p>
<p><a id="28.48"></a><span class="f_Strong">28.48 HIDDEN MINES:</span> Known Minefield counters may also be used to mark hexes containing hidden mines whose presence (but not strength) is discovered by either Searching (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.152" class="topiclink">A12.152</a>) or by a unit's being subjected to a mine attack DR therein. In addition, any &quot;normal&quot; Minefield counter is considered to indicate the presence of Known mines when placed onboard. Normal mines may not be otherwise exchanged for or converted to Known Mines.</p>

An A-T Mine can be selected by the defender for every three A-P minefield factors he forfeits. A-T Mines may compose a minefield hex of their own of from one to five factors, or be included in any strength from one to five factors in a normal A-P minefield. A-T Mines are not detonated by traversing Infantry/Cavalry. Only a wagon or a vehicle <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: motorcycles]</span> may trigger an A-T Mine attack.</p>

The Aerial AF (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.12" class="topiclink">C7.12</a>) corresponding to the AFV's lowest hull AF is used as an IFT positive DRM for KIA purposes only. Versus an unarmored vehicle (including any AFV with a hull AF of 0; <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.42" class="topiclink">28.42</a>), elimination is automatic, but a Burning Wreck applies only on a Final DR of ≤ 6 (i.e., ≤ 1KIA). Random Immobilization does not apply. An A-T Mine detonation has no effect on Personnel in the same hex other than PRC of the same vehicle who must roll for survival normally if the vehicle is eliminated, and Passengers/Riders who are attacked Collaterally with halved FP (i.e., 16) on the IFT if the vehicle is immobilized.

These mines can be placed at any time during an enemy MPh (even as an enemy vehicle enters the placement hex), or during a friendly fire phase of the owner's Player Turn, by an unpinned Good Order Infantry unit possessing that Daisy Chain counter in an ADJACENT hex. Such placement is noted on paper, and not revealed to the opponent until one of his Good Order units has a LOS to the hex containing the Daisy Chain. If the placement is announced immediately after a vehicle expends MP to enter (or change VCA within) the placement hex, the placer then immediately rolls as per <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.51" class="topiclink">28.51</a>. A Daisy Chain A-T minefield can attack only once; thereafter it ceases to exist. Any Daisy Chain counter which has not yet attacked can be Recovered like any other SW. Placement of a Daisy Chain does not cause loss of concealment, but otherwise is considered use of a SW. The portage cost of a Daisy Chain is one PP per A-T mine factor.
