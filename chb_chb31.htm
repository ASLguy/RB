<p><a id="31.132"></a><img src="cc.gif" width="58" height="62" alt="CC" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">31.132 CC:</span> A vehicle on a Narrow Street is subject to Street Fighting (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.8" class="topiclink">A11.8</a>) when attacked in CC (including CC Reaction Fire) if its attacker occupies the ground level of a building in one of the two hexes common to that Narrow Street hexside. &nbsp;A +1 DRM applies to all CC CMG attacks by a vehicle currently in CC/Melee on a Narrow Street.</p>
<p><a id="31.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">31.14 FORTIFICATIONS:</span> Fortifications not normally allowed in a paved road hex may be placed in a hex with ≥ one paved Narrow Street hexside unless prohibited by other terrain in the hex.</p>
<p><a id="31.141"></a><img src="roadblock.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="ROADBLOCK" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">31.141 ROADBLOCK:</span> A roadblock may be placed &quot;across&quot; a Narrow Street by setting up the counter so that it straddles, with its arrow pointing to a vertex of, that hexside. For LOS and movement purposes, the roadblock is considered to extend from center dot to center dot of the two hexes formed by that hexside. A Narrow Street roadblock cannot convey Wall Advantage, provides no TEM vs Indirect Fire or Residual FP, and prohibits VBM along the straddled hexside. As a non-Bypassing unit crosses a hexside that is straddled by a Narrow Street roadblock, it must declare a vertex of that hexside in order to establish, vs any ensuing Snap Shot, which &quot;side&quot; of the roadblock it is on (thus determining whether it will be able to claim the roadblock's protective benefits vs that attack). LOS to such a roadblock requires LOS to the entire straddled hexside (ignoring the roadblock itself) but HIP loss also occurs per <a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.33" class="topiclink">A12.33</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="b31141ex.gif" width="199" height="197" alt="b31141ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: A roadblock has been placed in hexes PBL12-K13, with its arrow pointing toward the L12-K13-K12 vertex. Since the roadblock is considered to extend from the center dot of L12 to the center dot of K13, squads F and G have no LOS to each other (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">9.2</a>), and squad H can claim neither roadblock TEM nor Wall Advantage if fired on by squad F. Squad G must also expend one MF to cross the roadblock if it Bypasses directly to vertex L12-K13-K12 (the two MF being expended simultaneously).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad H may enter K12 (whether entering or Bypassing the building) without the roadblock affecting its entry cost. If it directly enters building K13, its owner must declare if it crossed the hexside on the vertex L12-K13-K12 or L12-K13-L13 side of the roadblock; if he chooses the latter, an ensuing Snap Shot conducted by squad F (or by any other unit—including one in Bypass at vertex L12-K13-K12—whose LOS to vertex L12-K13-L13 first crosses the roadblock) will be subject to the roadblock's TEM. If squad E enters K12 by Bypassing along Narrow Street hexside L12-K12, each ensuing attack vs it [EXC: Indirect Fire; (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.1" class="topiclink">C.I</a>)] at vertex L12-K12-K13 by any unit whose LOS to that vertex first crosses the roadblock will likewise be subject to roadblock TEM.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A vehicle (tracked or not) in L11 moving to J12 would pay 1 MP along the L12-K12 hexside (half the normal 2 MP for Bypassing in Open Ground), plus 2 MP for the VCA change and entry onto the K12-K13 hexside, regardless of CE/BU status.</span></p>
<p><a id="31.1411"></a><span class="f_Strong">31.1411 REMOVAL:</span> Clearance attempts vs a Narrow Street roadblock can be made only from any of the four ground-level Locations that touch the straddled hexside. A unit wishing to use a DC to eliminate a Narrow Street roadblock must occupy one of the three hexes that form a vertex of the straddled hexside, and must declare the attempt to eliminate it. The DC is then Placed/Thrown/Set vs that vertex, and can affect nothing but the roadblock when it detonates. Direct Fire ordnance can eliminate a Narrow Street roadblock only if the firer has a LOS to the entire straddled hexside and declares the roadblock as its sole target prior to firing; the attack can affect nothing but the roadblock. Indirect Fire HE eliminates a Narrow Street roadblock with the proper result vs either of the two ground-level Locations that form the straddled hexside. <a href="chb_chb29.htm#29.5" class="topiclink">29.5</a> applies otherwise unchanged.</p>

The removal of such revealed mines as per <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.53" class="topiclink">28.53</a> is NA. Mines in either of the two hexes common to a Narrow Street hexside (or in both such hexes, if one contains A-P mines and the other A-T mines) can possibly affect a unit using Bypass along that hexside; however, if eacEXCh such hex contains mines of the same type but of a different strength from that in the other Location, only the higher strength can be used to attack the Bypassing unit. <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC to both: If that hexside is also a Crest Line hexside, only the mines in the lower-Base-Level hex are used.]</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chb_chb31.htm#31.141" class="topiclink">31.141</a> illustration, and assume that L13, K13, and K12 contain A-P minefields of six, eight and twelve factors respectively, which have to have been set up revealed. Any unit Bypassing along the L13-L12 Narrow Street hexside, regardless of which hex that unit occupies, will be attacked by the six-FP L13 minefield. A unit Bypassing along the K12-K13 Narrow Street hexside would undergo the twelve-FP attack of the K12 minefield.
