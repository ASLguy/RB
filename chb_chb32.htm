A hexside that is crossed by a RR depiction is termed a RR Hexside.</p>

<p><a id="32.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.13</span> Whenever GLRR and ElRR overlays are joined together, treat the two adjoining overlay hexes as EmRR hexes. Non-bypass units in RR hexes of the same railroad are treated as being at the same level as each other for all LOS between them that cross only RR hexsides (exclusive of vertices).<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chb_chbfootnotes.htm#12" class="topiclink">12</a></span></p>
<p><a id="32.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.14 &nbsp;RR BRIDGES:</span> A GLRR overlay may cross a depression hex (e.g., gully, stream, canal, river), in which case the depression terrain continues to exist as a separate Location beneath the RR. The GLRR crosses the depression on a stone bridge (<a href="chb_chb6.htm" class="topiclink">6.</a>) which extends to the hexsides of the two adjoining RR hexes, while the depression encompasses the entire Location below the overlay.</p>
<p><a id="32.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.2 OTHER TERRAIN:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chb_chbfootnotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">13</a></span> Although the RR hexes on overlays provided in DOOMED BATTALIONS contain no other terrain <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: potential RR Crossings, <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.4" class="topiclink">32.4</a>]</span>, other terrain types (woods, grain, brush, etc.) could potentially exist in a RR hex (by SSR or via future overlays). Except for GLRR hexes, this additional terrain would not be at the base Level of the hex (i.e., not at the same level as the RR), but rather would be considered to be at the level that the RR hex itself rises from (for EmRR and ElRR) or falls from (for SuRR) <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: bridges]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="32.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.21</span> If the height of the other terrain in the hex is ≤ the height of the RR (e.g., an EmRR or ElRR in a brush hex), the other terrain has no effect on LOS into the RR hex or to LOS that crossed the RR depiction; units in a RR hex are considered to be in Open Ground <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Infantry/Cavalry expending MF to enter ground-level non-Open-Ground terrain (<a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.3" class="topiclink">32.3</a>); units which qualify for pillbox/shellhole/artificial-terrain-(<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">B.9</a>) TEM]</span>. The -1 Air Burst TEM for woods does not apply to units in an ElRR hex since the woods are no higher than the RR.</p>
<p><img src="b3221ex.gif" width="139" height="139" alt="b3221ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: If the road in I3 and K3 were an ElRR, then a unit in K3 would be considered in Open Ground to any unit which it did not have Height Advantage over, and any LOS to it would be unaffected by the woods in its hex. If the road were instead an EmRR or a GLRR, then a unit in K3 would be considered in Open Ground only to LOS entering across a RR depiction (e.g., from a unit in J3).</span></p>
<p><a id="32.211"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.211</span> If the height of the other terrain in the hex is &gt; the height of the RR (e.g., a GLRR in a woods or brush hex), the principles of woods-road hexes (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.132" class="topiclink">A4.132</a> and <a href="chb_chb13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">13.3-.32</a>; <a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.6" class="topiclink">14.6</a> for orchards) are used for LOS/LOF purposes, treating a moving unit which crosses a RR hexside at the RR rate (i.e., does not expend MF/MP for the other terrain in the hex) as though it crossed a road hexside.</p>
<p><a id="32.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.3 MOVEMENT:</span> The MF/MP expenditure required to enter a RR hex is determined (per the Railroad Movement Costs Chart found on the Chapter B Divider) by the type of hexside being crossed (i.e., RR hexside or non-RR hexside) and whether or not a higher elevation is being entered (e.g., going from GLRR to EmRR or going from EmRR to ElRR). Additionally, Infantry/Cavalry units may, while crossing a GLRR hexside, actually enter the non-Open-Ground terrain (if any) in a RR hex by expending the necessary MF.</p>
<p><a id="32.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.31 &nbsp;BYPASS:</span> Units bypassing a woods-RR along a RR hexside (i.e., crossing the RR tracks) expend the MF/MP for crossing a non-RR hexside, excluding the COT of the woods being bypassed. Bypass along a non-RR hexside (i.e., parallel to the tracks of a woods-RR hex) is only allowed in GLRR hexes and costs normal Open Ground (or Brush) MF/MP.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.21" class="topiclink">32.21</a> illustration: If the road were either an ElRR or an EmRR, the woods could not by bypassed and a unit in J3 could enter K3 only by using the RR. If the road were a GLRR, a unit in 13 could bypass the woods in K3 along the I2/K3 and K2/K3 hexsides, or, if Infantry/Cavalry, could enter K3 without using the RR by paying the woods COT (thus getting benefit of the woods TEM).</span></p>
<p><a id="32.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.32 &nbsp;ELEVATION CHANGES:</span> When crossing a RR hexside, the maximum elevation change encountered is one half-level. A Railroad changing from GLRR to SuRR or vice versa does not change levels; only its relationship to the other terrain changes.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Infantry entering a brush hex containing an ElRR across a RR Hexside expends 1 MF. &nbsp;It could not expend extra MF to enter the brush terrain since this is not a GLRR. Infantry entering the same hex from a ground level hex across a non-RR Hexside expends 4 MF (2xCOT).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A halftrack entering this same hex across a RR hexside would expend 2 MP (3 MP if gaining elevation). If entering across a non-RR Hexside it would expend 7 MP (5 + COT) and would take a Bog Check with a +1 DRM (<a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.33" class="topiclink">32.33</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="32.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.33 BOG:</span> Only tracked vehicles can enter an ElRR hex across a non-RR Hexside and they must make a Bog Check DR (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">D8.2</a>) when doing so.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chb_chbfootnotes.htm#14" class="topiclink">14</a></span> Halftracks must add a +1 DRM to that Bog Check DR. Whenever other terrain <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Mud/Deep-Snow/Walls/Hedges require a separate Bog Check]</span> in the hex would require a Bog Check DR, only one DR is made, but with an additional +1 DRM; halftracks would therefore add a +2 DRM.</p>
<p><a id="32.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.4 RR CROSSINGS:</span> A road that runs up to a RR hex and continues beyond it in an adjacent non-RR hex crosses the RR via one of the four types of RR Crossings (RR-Xing) in <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.41" class="topiclink">32.41-.44</a>. A unit entering a RR-Xing via a road hexside may elect to pay the normal non-RR-hexside COT rather than use the road <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: ElRR-Xing and SuRR-Xing (<a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.43" class="topiclink">32.43-.44</a>)]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="32.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.41 &nbsp;GROUND LEVEL RR CROSSING:</span> In a GLRR-Xing, the RR and the road are both at ground level. A unit crossing a road hexside may enter at the normal road rate.</p>
<p><a id="32.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">32.42 EMBANKMENT RR CROSSING:</span> In an EmRR-Xing, the RR and the road are both at level ½ (<a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.12" class="topiclink">32.12</a>). A unit which enters using the road incurs no additional cost for changing elevation.</p>

The RR crosses the road on a stone bridge (<a href="chb_chb6.htm" class="topiclink">6.</a>) which extends to the hexsides of the two adjoining RR hexes. A unit entering an ElRR-Xing via a road hexside is at ground level in a separate Location underneath the bridge and must enter the hex at the road rate. A unit must cross a RR hexside in order to enter/exit an ElRR bridge Location <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: by Scaling (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.424" class="topiclink">23.424</a>)]</span>. Normal bridge rules (<a href="chb_chb6.htm" class="topiclink">6.</a> and <a href="chb_chb5.htm#5.21" class="topiclink">5.21</a>) apply to RR bridges <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: only Infantry/Cavalry may enter/exit the road Location via a RR hexside]</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chb_chbfootnotes.htm#15" class="topiclink">15</a></span></p>
