<p><a id="5.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.1</span> Elevated Roads are located on manmade mounds, usually constructed for purposes of flood control. Any hex such as 13Y8 or 13Y7 containing a road symbol bordered on two sides by two-tone brown contour lines (with the darker contour lines on the inside) is an Elevated Road hex.</p>
<p><a id="5.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.2</span> An Elevated Road is a one level obstacle (inclusive of the contour lines which border it) to LOS. Any unit on an Elevated Road on board 13 is at level 1 and subject to the same LOS restrictions as a unit on a level 1 hill.</p>
<p><a id="5.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.21</span> The contour lines forming the edge of the Elevated Road symbol are the equivalent of hill Crest Lines. Even so, vehicles cannot claim HD status on an Elevated Road hex. A unit at a lower level may maintain a LOS through an Elevated Road hex to another unit on the same level as the viewer only if its LOS does not cross any part of the brown contour lines of that Elevated Road hex or of the road itself.</p>
<p><img src="b521ex.gif" width="299" height="460" alt="b521ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The solid red lines show that 13H7 can see M7, but the dashed lines indicate that H7 cannot see a Crest unit in L6, because the H7-L6 LOS actually crosses the contour lines of the Elevated Road hex. An unobstructed LOS exists beneath the level 1 obstruction of the bridge between L7 and J4.</span></p>
<p><a id="5.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.22</span> Due to the Crest effects of an Elevated Road hex, a unit on an Elevated Road cannot see a unit at a lower level if it must trace its LOS through the brown contour lines of another Elevated Road hex.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Using the previous illustration, we find that a unit on 13G8 can see 7, but not J6. A unit in N4 can see J4 even though the LOS does cross the Elevated Road hex M5 because it does not cross the brown contour lines of that Elevated Road hex.</span></p>
<p><a id="5.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.3</span> An Elevated Road is considered Open Ground for TEM and Interdiction purposes, provided the Height Advantage TEM does not apply. The +1 TEM for Height Advantage can apply to Direct Fire from a lower elevation, thus allowing rout through the hex free of interdiction and movement free of the FFMO DRM. However, the Height Advantage TEM does not apply to moving units during Defensive First Fire or Interdiction, if in entering the Elevated Road the moving unit crosses a Crest Line through the same hexside that is intersected by the firer's LOS (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">10.31</a>).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Again using our previous illustration, we find that a broken unit in 13J6 can be Interdicted by a unit in I8 as the broken unit routs from J7. A unit in J6 making an Assault Move to I7 while being fired on from K8 receives only a +1 DRM (for Height Advantage) because the FFMO DRM does not apply.</span></p>
<p><a id="5.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.4</span> Movement costs across an Elevated Road hexside are identical to those of other roads. Only entrance of an Elevated Road hex through a non-road hexside differs.</p>
<p><a id="5.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.41</span> &nbsp;Infantry/Cavalry may enter an Elevated Road hex through a non-road hexside at a cost of two MF (one MF doubled to two for a move to higher elevation) unless the move gains two levels of height, in which case an Abrupt Elevation Change (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">10.5</a>) applies.</p>
<p><a id="5.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.42 </span>Tracked vehicles may enter or leave an Elevated Road hex through a non-road hexside at a MP cost equal to crossing an Open Ground hill Crest hexside. Vehicular entrance or exit of the Elevated Road hex directly to/from a Depression would amount to crossing an Abrupt Elevation hexside (see <a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">10.51</a>). Motorcycles which enter/leave an Elevated Road hex through a non-road hexside can do so only by chancing a Wreck Check dr (<a href="chd_chd15.htm#15.46" class="topiclink">D15.46</a>) or being pushed. All MP penalties for entering a hex containing a wreck/vehicle on a road (two MP), or for changing a VGA across a non-road hexside, are doubled while in an Elevated Road hex.</p>
<p><a id="5.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.5 </span>Entrenchments may not be placed in an Elevated Road hex. See also <a href="chb_chb3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">3.5</a>.</p>
