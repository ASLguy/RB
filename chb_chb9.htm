<p><a id="9.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.1</span> A wall represents a stone fence varying in height between one and two meters, and conforms to hexsides rather than the interior of a hex. Any hexside that overprints a thick gray line such as 2E4-E5 is a wall hexside. A hedge represents hedges one to two meters high and also conforms to hexsides. Any hexside containing a thick green line such as 2T1-U2 is a hedge hexside. The thick terrain depiction, as well as the hexside itself (inclusive of vertices), represents the wall/hedge and will affect any LOS through it, except for obvious breaks in the depiction such as 6W9-X9. A wall/hedge cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p><img src="b91ex.gif" width="283" height="361" alt="b91ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: An attack from 6Y6 to Z7 is affected by the hedge hexside Y7-Z7 even though the hedge depiction does not actually extend to the vertex.</span></p>
<p><a id="9.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.2 LOS:</span> Wall and hedge hexsides are Half-Level obstacles to same-level LOS (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.21" class="topiclink">A6.21</a>) unless the wall/hedge hexside is part of the viewing/target hex. A wall/hedge hexside never blocks LOS to any portion of its own hex even in the case of Snap Shots or vs Bypassing units on the opposite side of that hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>]</span>. A wall/hedge lying lengthwise (on a hexspine) exactly along a LOS is a Half-Level LOS obstacle only if the wall/hedge hexspine is not touching the viewing or target hex, or if touching one of the viewing/target hexes and the vertex opposite of the viewing/target hex has walls/hedges on all of its three hexspines.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The 4-4-7 in 6Z9 can attack the 8-3-8 in X6 with a +2 DRM for the wall because both intervening wall/hedge hexspines are part of either the firing or target hex and neither of them has three wall/hedge hexspines on the vertex that is part of neither Z9 nor X6. If Y8-Y9 were a hedge hexside, no LOS would exist since the Y8-Y9-Z8 vertex would have wall/hedge hexsides on all three hexspines. If a German unit were in Y8, both it and the 4-4-7 would qualify for the +1 TEM of the Z8-Y9 hexspine when firing at each other. If the Z8-Y9 hedge did not exist (or were instead at Y8-Y9), the LOS from Z9 to X6 would be blocked at the Y8-Y9-Z8 vertex.</span></p>

<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">If a unit in 11D7 moves to 11C7, and a unit in 11G9 takes a snapshot at that moving unit along the D7/C7 hexside, is the LOS blocked by the hedge? If not, does the tem apply?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> No. Yes. (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a> specifically mentions that the hedge hexside “...of a hex being entered/exited can modify a Snap Shot if crossed by the LOF on the way to the target hexside”.)</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">Would this be an exception to the <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a> example? It seems to be a very similar situation (LOS to a vertex/hexside). Would that be a range 3 attack or range 4 attack?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> The target is considered in C7 for range purposes but the attack is occurring at the hexside, unlike in  <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a> where the hypothetical is clearly in the further hex.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">Assume that the 467 in 2Z3 enters 2AA4, and that a hypothetical DEFENDER in 2X2 that makes a Snap Shot attack at the Z3/AA4 hexside.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">1) In the above situation, “the hex the target would remain in if affected by that fire” is the hex entered (AA4), so <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5c" class="topiclink">C.5C</a> can be read: “The hex containing the target is the hex entered (AA4)”. Does <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5c" class="topiclink">C.5C</a> therefore say that the 467 is considered in the hex entered (AA4) for Snap Shot purposes? If no, what is the meaning of <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5c" class="topiclink">C.5C</a>?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">2) Range: <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5a" class="topiclink">C.5A</a> defines the range to always be counted to the hex entered (AA4). Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">3) Covered Arc: If a hypothetical MG with a fixed CA (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">A9.21</a>) has the hex exited (Z3) inside its CA, but not the hex entered (AA4), a snap shot is not possible (according to <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5b" class="topiclink">C.5B</a>). Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Correct.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">4) Walls/Hedges: <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">B9.2</a> says that a wall/hedge blocks LOS unless the wall/hedge is part of the target hex, but <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a> says that a wall/hedge hexside of a hex being entered/exited can modify a snap shot. This is to understand that such a wall/hedge hexside can never block the Snap Shot LOS, so for snap shot purposes the LOS is clear regardless of which hex the target 467 is in. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Yes, if I understand your question correctly. Basically, since the Snap Shot is made at another hexside of the same hex (Z3) with the original wall/hedge then the LOS is not blocked (though wall/hedge TEM for that original wall/hedge will apply).</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">5) Rubble: The same <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a> sentence applies similarly to Rubble, so if Z3 and/or AA4 contains rubble, the Snap Shot LOS is not blocked, but is affected by Rubble TEM, and the highest if one contains Wooden Rubble and the other Stone Rubble. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> In your EX, rubble in Z3 would affect the Snap Shot; rubble in Z4 would not since it is not “...crossed by the LOF on the way to the target hexside.”</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">6) SMOKE:</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">6a) The same <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a> sentence applies similarly to SMOKE, so if Z3 or AA4 contains SMOKE, the LOF is affected by the SMOKE. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">6b) If both Z3 and AA4 contains SMOKE, are both added as DRM as per <a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.2" class="topiclink">A24.2</a>?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Only if there is SMOKE in the hex “...crossed by the LOF on the way to the target hexside”; so only SMOKE in Z3 would affect the Snap Shot in your EX. SMOKE in AA4 would be ignored, per <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">7) Hindrances: Assume that Z3 is an Orchard hex:</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">7a) Since the LOF goes through Z3, to a hexside of AA4, the Orchard +1 Hindrance is added. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">7b) Now look at the Snap Shot taken when the 467 originally entered Z3 from Z4. The +1 Hindrance would not be added here, since the LOF did not exit Z3 (into Z4), and therefore did not go through the Orchard as per <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">A6.7</a>. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Yes. Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">8) Blind hexes: <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a> says “Any unit ... may claim a Snap Shot if it can trace a LOS to an entire hexside (even if that hexside is part of a Blind hex)” So the DEFENDER can make a Snap Shot even if either Z3 or AA4 are Blind hexes (but not if both are, I assume). Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Basically.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">9) Inherent terrain: Assume that AA4 is a Dense Jungle hex:</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">9a) Since the LOF goes to a hexside of AA4, the Jungle TEM is added. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">9b) Assume that the 467 instead moved from AA4 to Z3 (and therefore is in Z3). The Jungle TEM is not added, since the LOF is only drawn to the Z3 portion of the hexside, and there is therefore no “mere entrance of the hex [AA4]” as required by <a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.6" class="topiclink">B.6</a>. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> No, since the Jungle was not “...crossed by the LOF on the way to the target hexside.” Note that <a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a>specifies that such inherent terrain TEM won’t apply unless “...crossed by the LOF on the way to the target hexside. Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">10) Board entry/exit: Assume that AA4 is offboard:</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">10a) Since the AA4 part of the hexside is off-board and the target hex is AA4, no Snap Shot is allowed when the 467 exits the playing area by entering AA4. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">10b) Assume that the 467 instead moved from AA4 (off-board) to Z3. The target hex is now Z3 which is on-board, so the Snap Show is allowed. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Yes. Yes, as long as there is a real hexside there (i.e., not an unused mapboard butted up against an ‘in-play’ half-hex with the Snap Shot made against a hexside of the unused mapboard).</span></p>

<p><a id="9.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.21 ENTRENCHMENTS:</span> A unit in an entrenchment cannot see (or be seen) across a same-level wall/hedge hexside/hexspine to (or from) any non-adjacent same-level or lower Location—although an elevation advantage of at least a half-level over the Entrenchment does allow such LOS. LOS is reciprocal. If a viewer would have LOS to any non-entrenched units in such a Location, it also has LOS to any entrenchments in that Location even though it may not have LOS to units beneath that entrenchment.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="b921ex.gif" width="198" height="262" alt="b921ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The 4-4-7 can make a Snap Shot at the unit entering hex 3Z3 because a &quot;hedge hexside never blocks LOS to any portion of its own hex&quot;. Now assume that Z3 is a building hex and that a vehicle in Bypass exists at CAFP Z3-Z4-AA4. Provided the LOS is not blocked by the building, the 4-4-7 can trace a LOS to that vertex. The same could not be said for a Bypass vehicle in Z4 at CAFP Z4-Z3-AA4 (assuming Z4 was a woods/building hex allowing such Bypass) because it is in a different hex and thus blocked by the Z3-Y3 hedge even though the target points are essentially the same (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">C.5</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: If the 4-6-7 in 3Z3 were beneath a foxhole, no LOS would exist between the 4-6-7 and the 4-4-7 in X1, but the 4-4-7 would still have LOS to the foxhole, thus revealing it if hidden.</span></p>

If the 4-4-7 (or the 6-2-8 in Q7) First Fires now, the attack will be subject to building TEM. After this the 4-6-8 may still claim WA (since it has not yet completed its MPh) even if not spending additional MF, but if doing so the 4-4-7 may (Subsequent) First Fire subject to the hedge TEM and the 6-2-8 may (Subsequent) First Fire with FFMO (assuming the DEFENDERS haven't exhausted their First Fire capability based on the three MF expended when entering the Location). The 4-6-8 may wait until the APh to claim WA, but if the 4-6-7 in Q5 becomes broken (or leaves) before this, the 4-4-7 in P5 must claim WA (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.323" class="topiclink">9.323</a>) and will thereafter prevent the 4-6-8 from claiming it.</p>

He also uses two OB-designated &quot;?&quot; for a dummy stack in R2, which is allowed for the same reason.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">The British player sets up a 4-5-7 in S1, with LOS to Q1 and R2 through non-bocage hexsides, so the 2-3-7 is placed onboard unconcealed and the dummy stack is eliminated when the British setup has been completed. The squad in R1 remains hidden due to being in an orchard hex.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">During the British MPh, the 6-4-8 moves to Q3, thereby forcing the hidden 2-4-7 to be placed onboard beneath &quot;?&quot;.</span></p>

It is the British PFPh and the 6-4-8 in 54K4 prep fires against the 4-6-7 and breaks it. A lone broken unit cannot claim WA (9.32), even in a hex where mandatory WA (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.323" class="topiclink">9.323</a>) otherwise applies; the 4-6-7 therefore loses WA and disappears out of LOS from both British units, making it immune to further attacks.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">During the British MPh, the concealed 3-3-8 uses Non-Assault Movement and enters K4 without claiming WA (due to the woods TEM), and is therefore out of the 4-4-7's LOS. It continues to L4 where it must claim WA (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.323" class="topiclink">9.323</a>), thereby moving within the 4-4-7's LOS, but still retaining Concealment since the movement is treated as Assault Movement for &quot;?&quot;-loss purposes (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.55" class="topiclink">9.55</a>). Similarly, the 3-3-8 would not lose Concealment by entering/exiting a foxhole or changing Crest status, but would lose Concealment by performing any other Concealment loss actions (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.141" class="topiclink">A12.141</a>) besides movement in L4 (e.g., placing a DC). The 4-4-7 and MMG attack with 4 FP (9 FP halved for Concealment) and +2 DRM (+2 [bocage TEM] +1 [orchard Hindrance] -1 [FFNAM]), to no effect but retains ROF. No Residual FP would be placed even if ROF had been lost, since the Residual FP is reduced three columns due to orchard and bocage.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">(If there were a German 2-4-7 in L5 with WA, the 3-3-8 could not claim WA when entering L4.

In this case the LOS from the 2-4-7 would not receive bocage TEM, so the 3-3-8 would lose &quot;?&quot; and be subject to FFMO from the 2-4-7, but would be out of LOS from the 4-4-7 in K6, and therefore immune to attacks from it.)</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">At the start of the German DFPh, the 6-4-8 drops WA (which he could have done anytime after firing [9.322]), thereby disappearing from the 4-4-7's LOS. So the 4-4-7 instead fires its MMG at the concealed 3-3-8 which cannot drop WA. A PTC is rolled, forcing loss of the 3-3-8's &quot;?&quot;.</span></p>

At the end of the British CCPh, both British MMC gain &quot;?&quot; since all enemy LOS is traced through bocage hexsides (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.55" class="topiclink">9.55</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">At the start of the next German Player Turn, the 4-6-7 rallies and immediately gains WA (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.323" class="topiclink">9.323</a>). The British 6-4-8 then forfeits WA again to avoid German Prep Fire. During the German MPh, the 4-6-7 Assault Moves to K5 where it is prevented from claiming WA by the 3-3-8 in L4. The 6-4-8 cannot reclaim WA at this point, so its attack against the 4-6-7 receives the +2 bocage TEM, while fire from the 3-3-8 receives FFMO. If the 6-4-8 and 3-3-8 formed a FG, the attack would receive +2 bocage TEM and no FFMO.</span></p>

If in-hex TEM were available, it could not regain WA over those hexsides until the following RPh (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.322" class="topiclink">9.322</a>).
