<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.  <a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1 BRIDGES:</a></span> The term &quot;stone construction&quot; is used to define any heavy construction material other than wood. A &quot;stone&quot; bridge or building is just as likely to be made of reinforced concrete, bricks, or other masonry materials.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.  <a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">6.5 BURNING:</a></span> Burning bridges as a game tactic is so damaging to most scenario Victory Conditions that it is usually not allowed. Realistically speaking this is not as bad as it sounds, for the battlefield commander never had the omniscient view of the battlefield that the player enjoys, nor did he have set Victory Conditions that could be neatly achieved by burning a bridge without regard to the stragglers who might be left behind—or the sudden appearance of reinforcements needing that same bridge to counterattack. In short, the decision is too important and too easy for the player to be entrusted with lest he abuse the privilege.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3. <a href="chb_chb7.htm" class="topiclink">7. RUNWAYS:</a></span> Although paved runways were hardly commonplace battlefields, they proved to be among the most lethal terrain the &quot;poor bloody infantry&quot; could cross in the face of enemy fire. Going to ground on macadam/concrete surfaces provided no relief from incoming fire, whose explosive force and fragmentation had no chance to be muffled in the earth; indeed, the hard surface increased the ricochet danger from spent rounds and short-falling fire.</p>
<p><a id="3a"></a><span class="f_Strong">3A. <a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.6" class="topiclink">27.6 LOWER LEVEL LOCATIONS:</a></span>These rules have been included to reflect the fact that in a fortified line (which is what trenches usually represent) communication trenches linked the various defensive positions. It wouldn't make much sense to fortify a hilltop but not provide a protected access route to it. Sangars were included to further emphasize the benefits inherent in a well-planned position.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4. <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.411" class="topiclink">28.411 A-P MINE ATTACK:</a></span> An A-P minefield &quot;attack&quot; does not necessarily indicate that a detonation has occurred. It merely indicates that the unit is at risk while moving through the minefield. If a unit survives a minefield attack, even by passing a MC, it is assumed to have avoided tripping any mines. A unit that pins is considered to have discovered the mines and gone to ground, but has not actually been attacked by them. A detonation occurs only if the unit breaks or is Reduced/eliminated.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.  <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.51" class="topiclink">28.51 A-T MINE ATTACK:</a> </span>Unlike an A-P minefield attack, an A-T mine attack indicates that a detonation has occurred.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.  <a href="chb_chb31.htm" class="topiclink">31. VILLAGE TERRAIN:</a></span> With the introduction of HASL modules RED BARRICADES, KAMPFGRUPPE PEIPER, and PEGASUS BRIDGE, new terrain types representing the particular historical battlefields were developed. While some of these terrain types are very specific to the particular battle (e.g., Roofless Factory Hexes in RB), others are more representative of Europe in general. We felt that some of these terrain types warranted wider use than just the original HASL map sheets. In order to utilize them on the geomorphic boards, they had to be included in Chapter B. Since we were expanding Chapter B in DOOMED BATTALIONS to include rules for the new Railroad terrain, we have taken the opportunity to include some of these HASL terrain types as well.</p>
<p>The Village Terrain rules were originally developed to deal with specific situations in the HASL modules. Single-Hex Two Story Buildings were introduced in RB, while Narrow Streets and Steeples were introduced in KGP. All were used in PB. The two new building types are included on board 45 and overlays in DOOMED BATTALIONS, and on Board 46 along with Narrow Streets.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.  <a href="chb_chb31.htm#31.1" class="topiclink">31.1 NARROW STREET:</a> </span>Many European villages and hamlets had very narrow streets, which are represented on the map board by &quot;hexside roads.&quot; Such streets were notorious for restricting the maneuverability of even average-sized vehicles.</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">8. <a href="chb_chb31.htm#31.11" class="topiclink">31.11 ONE-LANE:</a></span> Here &quot;road&quot; is defined to mean a string of ≥ one contiguous Narrow Street hexside between the two vertices/hexsides where that string either ends (EX: vertex PBDD10-DD11-EE11), joins with two other Narrow Street hexsides (EX: vertex K12-K13-L12), or becomes a non-hexside road (EX: vertex J12-K12-K13). Hence, each of the following constitutes a separate &quot;road&quot; for one-lane purposes: hexsides K9-L9 and K10-L9; hexsides K13-L12 and L13-L12; and single hexsides B16-C16; P12-P13; K12-K13; K12-L12 and so on.</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.  <a href="chb_chb31.htm#31.11" class="topiclink">31.11 DASHING/ROUTING:</a></span> Dashing across/along a Narrow Street is NA mainly to prevent any conflict between the rules for First Fire vs a Dashing unit and those for Snap Shots. Routing along a Narrow Street is NA because a routing unit may not Bypass (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">A4.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">10. <a href="chb_chb32.htm" class="topiclink">32. RAILROADS:</a></span> Railroads played a big role in the strategic aspects of WW2. Many battles were fought over or around them, and partisan activity often centered around disrupting the flow of men and supplies along them. Railroads were an important terrain feature throughout the world, especially in northwest Europe where they were readily encountered. While railroads often had a distinctive effect on tactical level combat, their presence just as frequently had no appreciable impact. Some of the battles already portrayed in ASL scenarios took place on or around railroads, but there was no indication that the existence of the railroad had any impact on the fighting. The major exception so far has been the Historical ASL module RED BARRICADES. The embanked railroads in the Barrikady played an important role in the early German attacks into the factories. By virtue of being on a historical mapsheet, the Railway Embankments and the accompanying rules in RB could limit themselves to a specific situation. The hexside nature of the Railway Embankments in RB fit that situation very well, but was too limiting for geomorphic boards.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11. <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.1" class="topiclink">32.1 RAILROAD TYPES:</a> </span>Railroads run through many different types of terrain, via many different methods. To reflect this diversity, railroads at several levels are described, using the existing rules for roads (including sunken roads and elevated roads) and hillocks as a basis. Even so, in order to keep these rules both playable and of manageable length, a good degree of abstraction takes place.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">12.  <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.13" class="topiclink">32.13 SAME LEVEL LOS:</a> </span>Railroads typically have a very gentle gradient, gentle enough not to affect line of sight along them. Nonetheless, they do change elevation, especially in relation to the other terrain around them. Treating LOS along a railroad as always being at the same level proved to be the best compromise of realism and playability.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.  <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.2" class="topiclink">32.2 OTHER TERRAIN:</a></span> These rules are intended to be flexible enough to allow for railroads sharing a hex with terrain other than open ground, bridges, or roads. This flexibility comes at the price of some additional complexity. It is envisioned, however, that the vast majority of ASL railroads will pass through open ground, and only overlays of this type are being provided in DOOMED BATTALIONS. While further scenario design experience might uncover the need for railroad hexes combined with other terrain, rules sections <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.2" class="topiclink">32.2-.211</a> and <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.31" class="topiclink">32.31</a> will not come into play until such time.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><span class="f_Strong">14. <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.33" class="topiclink">32.33 BOG:</a></span> While generally treated in the rules as an Elevated Road, an Elevated Railroad is usually narrower than an actual road, and harder to enter from &quot;off-road.&quot; Thus, although entry of an Elevated Road across a non-road hexside does not require a Bog Check, entry of an Elevated Railroad across a non-Railroad hexside does.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><span class="f_Strong">15. <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.43" class="topiclink">32.43 ELEVATED RR CROSSING:</a></span> Typically, the area around an Elevated Railroad Bridge is more built up, with much less room for maneuver, than a similar area involving a road that crosses a stream or gully on a bridge. A vehicle would have a much tougher time moving from up on an elevated railroad to under the bridge (and vice versa) than it would moving from on a road into the gully (or stream) under the bridge (and vice versa).</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="16"></a><span class="f_Strong">16. <a href="chb_chb32.htm#32.44" class="topiclink">32.44 SUNKEN RR CROSSING: </a></span>Vehicles are prohibited from entering a Sunken Railroad across a non-Railroad hexside, just as they are prohibited from entering a Sunken Lane across a non-road hexside.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><span class="f_Strong">17.  <a href="chb_chb33.htm#33.1" class="topiclink">33.1 STREAM-HEX TERRAIN:</a></span> Although stream-brush and stream-orchard hexes remain confined so far to the KGP maps, we include them here with stream-woods hexes for ease of reference.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><span class="f_Strong">18. <a href="chb_chb34.htm" class="topiclink">34. TOWERS:</a> </span>Tower rules are used to represent various highstanding structures such as water towers scattered throughout France and artillery spotting towers on Tarawa as well as other types of unenclosed towers and observation platforms. Clock towers and other substantial enclosed structures will be better represented by normal buildings (<a href="chb_chb23.htm" class="topiclink">23.</a>), perhaps in combination with Steeples (<a href="chb_chb31.htm#31.2" class="topiclink">31.2</a>). Towers can also be depicted, via an SSR, by on-map buildings. The definition of Towers in these rules was left somewhat open; they were given &quot;plug in&quot; characteristics with the intent that scenario designers adapt them to their own specific situations. Towers were originally included in Pegasus Bridge and also appear in our Blood Reef: Tarawa HASL module.</p>
