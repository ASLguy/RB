<p><a id="1.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.1</span> OBA represents a battery of Guns outside the area represented by the mapboard, using radio-directed Indirect Fire to fire HE or SMOKE (or IR; <a href="che_che1.htm#1.93" class="topiclink">E1.93</a>) onto designated areas of the mapboard. OBA availability is usually symbolized by the presence of a radio counter in the scenario OB and is further defined by SSR or DYO purchase as to type. Each radio in the OB represents one predesignated available OBA battery (aka module). Each battery may produce a variable number of Fire Missions, but only via the one radio representing it in the scenario. If that radio is lost, so is the opportunity to contact that battery; another radio may not be used to call in the remaining Fire Missions of that battery.</p>

Only an Observer (i.e., a Good Order leader possessing a functioning radio/field-phone counter [<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6</a>], or an OP tank [<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.46" class="topiclink">H1.46</a>], or an Offboard Observer [1.63; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.6" class="topiclink">E7.6</a>]) may attempt Radio Contact <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: not if he is a Rider, or a Guard whose US# is &lt; that of his prisoners]</span>, and may do so only at the start of the PFPh/DFPh<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chc_chcfootnotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">1</a></span> (as given in the Advanced Sequence of Play) as his sole action for that phase aside from other allowed OBA activities. Radio Contact is established with a DR ≤ the Radio Contact value printed on the radio counter (∆). If the Radio Contact DR is failed, neither the radio nor the Observer may attempt Radio Contact again until the start of his next PFPh/DFPh (whichever comes first; see also <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.61" class="topiclink">1.61</a>). The Contact value may vary with nationality and, in some cases, time frame of the scenario. If a radio counter has a multiple Contact value, the dates for their use are listed on the reverse side.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The Russian Contact value of 6/7/8 indicates a Radio Contact value of 6 through June '42, 7 from July '42 through June '43, and 8 thereafter.</span></p>

In addition, whenever placing an AR counter onboard in order to place (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">1.3</a>) or Correct (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.4" class="topiclink">1.4</a>) a SR/FFE, and whenever Converting any SR/FFE:C to a FFE:1 (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.332" class="topiclink">1.332-.333</a>; <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.342" class="topiclink">1.342</a>), Battery Access must be attempted a second (i.e., an extra) time if ≥ one non-hidden enemy ground unit is in/adjacent-to the AR (or, when Converting, to the SR/FFE:C) counter's hex but none of those units are Known to the Observer (see also <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6</a>). Battery Access is gained only by randomly drawing a black card/chit from that battery's Draw Pile (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.211" class="topiclink">1.211</a>) and revealing it to the opponent. Once gained, Battery Access is retained until the end of a RPh in which that battery has a FFE:C counter onboard or until a FFE of that battery is Cancelled (whichever comes first). Failure to gain Battery Access (i.e., drawing a red card/chit at any time) does not break Radio Contact, but does cause all currently onboard AR/SR/FFE counters of that battery to be removed, Cancels its current Fire Mission (if any), and ends that Observer's and battery's OBA actions for that phase. In addition, the second permanently-removed (i.e., non-extra) red card/chit drawn for a battery causes the loss of its Battery Access for the duration of the scenario. The current Radio-Contact and Battery-Access status of each radio is marked on the Scenario Aid Card by flipping the Battery Contact counter to the appropriate side and placing it in either the &quot;Battery Access&quot; box (if Access has been gained) or the &quot;Contact&quot; box (if it has not).</p>

<p><a id="1.211"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.211 DRAW PILE:</span> Each battery's Draw Pile is assembled prior to setup, and comprises a number of black and red chits or playing cards (hereafter referred to collectively as chits) as listed in the form &quot;#B/#R&quot; in that nationality's &quot;OBA ACCESS&quot; column of the A25 National Capabilities Chart on the Chapter A divider. (OBA chits are the reverse side of certain DM counters.) Each Draw Pile can be increased at this time by one or more of the following, as applicable: one extra black chit if the battery has been assigned ≥ one Pre-Registered hex (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.73" class="topiclink">1.73</a>); one extra black chit if it is specified as having Plentiful Ammunition; one extra red chit if it has Scarce Ammunition. The Draw Pile is then &quot;shuffled&quot; and set aside for use during play. Whenever Battery Access is lost or a new chit draw is made, the previously drawn chit is removed permanently from the Draw Pile <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: each extra chit drawn as per <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.21" class="topiclink">1.21</a> is mixed back into the Pile immediately after being revealed]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="1.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.22 MAINTAINING RADIO CONTACT:</span> To maintain Radio Contact from a preceding turn, the player must roll ≤ the Radio Contact value again in his next PFPh or DFPh (whichever comes first), but may deduct one from the DR <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: the Maintenance DRM is -2 if the battery is 70+mm/80+mm battalion mortar OBA.</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chc_chcfootnotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">2</a></span><span class="f_EXC">]</span>. The Maintenance DR is the Observer's sole allowed action for that fire phase (other than further allowed radio activities). A radio is a 1PP SW. A leader must possess a radio to use it.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chc_chcfootnotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">3</a></span> A radio breaks down on any Original Contact or Maintenance DR of 12 (or as listed on the radio counter) and is subject to normal SW Repair (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.72" class="topiclink">A9.72</a>). The involuntary loss of Contact does not automatically cause loss of Battery Access, but failure to regain Contact in the next friendly PFPh/DFPh (whichever comes first) will prevent the Conversion, Correction, and voluntary Cancellation of that battery's onboard SR/FFE counter; the FFE would continue to be resolved as per <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.5" class="topiclink">1.5-.51</a>, and, if still existing at the end of the RPh in which it is a FFE:C, would at that time be Cancelled (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.34" class="topiclink">1.34</a>); a SR would remain in place. Voluntary loss of Contact (i.e., failure to roll for Contact/Maintenance or voluntary rout; <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6</a>) causes the immediate loss of Access and Cancellation of the Fire Mission (if any). However, failing to roll for Contact/Maintenance is considered voluntary loss of Contact only if the Observer has no LOS to the SR's/FFE's Blast Height; <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.32" class="topiclink">1.32</a>).

A Security Area is a prerecorded line of hexes with either the same vertical row letter or horizontal grid number from the Field Phone (inclusive) to its Friendly Board Edge. Anytime a FFE is resolved within that area resulting in an Original KIA DR, or the opposing player rolls an Original 2 DR for any purpose for one (or more) of his units in the Security Area, the line is considered cut and the Field Phone is removed. A Field Phone and its Observer may always set up using HIP (if otherwise able to).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: If a Field Phone is in hex 4E5 and its Friendly Board Edge is along the side whose hexes are numbered 10, its Security Area is Hex Grain E5-E10.

LOS is then checked from the Observer to the AR's hex; if no such LOS exists to any non-Aerial Location therein, that AR is removed, that Observer's OBA actions are considered finished for the current phase, and at the opponent's option that current Fire Mission is Cancelled. If at this point the AR is not removed (as per either the preceding sentence or a 1.21 extra red chit draw), the player then makes an Accuracy dr to determine if his SR will land Accurately (i.e., in the AR's hex). For British (including Free French), German, and U.S. OBA <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: Offboard Observer (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.63" class="topiclink">1.63</a>; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.61" class="topiclink">E7.61</a>)]</span> and Shore Fire-Control Party (<a href="chg_chg14.htm#14.64" class="topiclink">G14.64</a>), a Final Accuracy dr of ≤ 2 (see below and <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.62" class="topiclink">1.62</a> for cumulative drm) results in the SR landing on target and the AR counter being exchanged for a red Spotting Round (SR) counter. All other nationalities must make a Final Accuracy dr of ≤ 1 to result in the SR landing on target. An Accuracy dr made for a Corrected SR that is predesignated to be Converted to a FFE (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.332" class="topiclink">1.332</a>) receives a + 1 drm if that SR was Corrected 7-12 hexes, or a +2 drm if it was Corrected 13-18 hexes.

<p><a id="1.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.31 &nbsp;DIRECTION/EXTENT OF ERROR:</span> Make a DR if the SR does not land on target on the AR.

It is not, thanks to the Known (to him) Russian in U4, so he exchanges the SR for a FFE:1 counter which will now attack the Russians in U4, V3, and W4 (despite the latter two being out of his LOS) with 12 FP. He makes a separate IFT DR for each target hex, with a +2 TEM for V3, a -1 TEM for W4, and a +1 TEM for U4 (U4-V4 wall; <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.34" class="topiclink">B9.34</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the Russian in U4 were under a &quot;?&quot; and in Concealment Terrain, or were absent altogether, the German would have to draw an extra black chit before he could convert the SR.</span></p>
<p><a id="1.63"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.63 OFFBOARD OBSERVER:</span> A SSR may give a player an OBA module that uses an Offboard Observer. The SSR will specify a particular on-board hex and level (even though the listed hex may have no such level), and all OBA LOS checks are taken from this point as if the Observer were located there. Since there is no Observer actually in the designated Observer hex, any fire or movement into/through that hex has no effect on the OBA <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Hindrances affect the Observer's LOS (and hence, Accuracy dr)from that hex level normally]</span>. Even though no radio is provided for the OBA module, all OBA procedures are conducted normally except that Radio Contact and Maintenance are automatic. The Final Accuracy dr required for OBA using an Offboard Observer is always ≤ 1 <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Pre-Registered Fire; <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.73" class="topiclink">1.73</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="1.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.7 FIRE MISSIONS:</span> A Fire Mission consists of the entire time between Battery Access chit draws in which a FFE is on board. There are seven types of Fire Missions. The first is the HE Concentration and the second the SMOKE Concentration (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.71" class="topiclink">1.71</a>), the Blast Area for both of which is defined in <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.32" class="topiclink">1.32</a>. The other types are Harassing Fire (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.72" class="topiclink">1.72</a>), IR (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.93" class="topiclink">E1.93</a>), Barrage (<a href="che_che12.htm#12.1" class="topiclink">E12.1</a>), SMOKE Barrage (<a href="che_che12.htm#12.51" class="topiclink">E12.51</a>) and Creeping Barrage (<a href="che_che12.htm#12.7" class="topiclink">E12.7</a>). A Fire Mission cannot be of more than one type; e.g., if a battery uses a HE Concentration in its FFE:1 stage, it cannot switch to Harassing Fire or SMOKE, etc., in its FFE:2 stage. Whenever a FFE:1 appears onboard, or when an SR is predesignated for conversion to a FFE (although if it does not actually Convert it may be re-designated later), the type of Fire Mission to be used (including whether Smoke or WP) must be announced immediately by its owner (before making any required Accuracy dr for it). <span class="f_Emphasis">[EXC: IR Missions must be declared prior to the Mission's first Battery Access draw]</span>. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span></p>
<p><a id="1.71"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.71 SMOKE:</span> A SMOKE FFE is treated like an equivalent HE FFE except that it does not attack with HE, and in the PFPh and DFPh it places a SMOKE counter in each Blast Area hex. Normal SMOKE rules (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.76" class="topiclink">3.76</a>; <a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.5" class="topiclink">8.5-.6</a>; <a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.2" class="topiclink">A24.2-.8</a>) apply <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: during the PFPh and DFPh, a WP FFE subjects all vulnerable units/PRC in every Blast Area hex—not just those in Locations where WP counters are placed—to an </span><span class="f_Emphasis"><a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.31" class="topiclink">A24.31</a> NMC]</span>.

The Blast Area of Harassing Fire comprises all onboard hexes within two hexes of the FFE counter, and its per-hex FP within that 19-hex Blast Area is 1/3 of that battery's HE Concentration FP; however, it cannot place SMOKE. Harassing Fire is indicated by using a blue FFE counter.</p>
<p><a id="1.73"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.73 PRE-REGISTERED FIRE:</span> Pre-Registered Fire may be used only if allowed by SSR or DYO-purchase (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.53" class="topiclink">H1.53</a>), and only if that battery's Observer starts the game onboard or is an Offboard Observer (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.63" class="topiclink">1.63</a>; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.6" class="topiclink">E7.6</a>). Prior to the start of the opponent's setup, that Observer's owner may secretly record ≥ one (as determined by SSR or DYO-purchase) target hex as that battery's Pre-Registered hex(es). A battery with Pre-Registered Fire capability also receives an extra black chit in its Battery Access Draw Pile (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.211" class="topiclink">1.211</a>). If that Observer has both Battery Access and a LOS to any non-Aerial Location in a Pre-Registered hex of that battery, the following rules apply (Pre-Registered Fire has no additional effect):</p>
<p><a id="1.731"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.731</span> &nbsp;After successfully placing the AR on that Pre-Registered hex, the player may dispense with the SR and instead immediately place a FFE: 1 on that AR. He then rolls for Accuracy, etc. as per <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.732" class="topiclink">1.732</a>.</p>
<p><a id="1.732"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.732 </span>While the AR is in that Pre-Registered hex (even if the SR is not being dispensed with), Accuracy (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">1.3</a>) occurs if the Original dr is ≤ 4; if not Accurate, the Extent of Error dr is halved (FRU).</p>
<p><a id="1.733"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.733</span> Pre-Registered Fire may be used with any type of Fire Mission <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: only as per <a href="che_che12.htm#12.71" class="topiclink">E12.71</a> for Creeping Barrage]</span>, but is always limited to the specific Observer and battery (not radio or field phone) that start the scenario with such capabilities.</p>
<p><a id="1.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.8 BOMBARDMENT:</span> The following rules, which may be invoked only via SSR or DYO-purchase, simulate the artillery softening-up process conducted prior to a set-piece attack.</p>
<p><a id="1.81"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.81 &nbsp;AREA:</span> Bombardment begins after setup <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> but prior to the start of play. Bombardment potentially affects all the hexes of an entire mapboard (hexrows A-GG) or two adjacent halfboards (hexrows A-Q/Q-GG) at the firer's option, including all friendly units present in that designated area. The firer makes six dr, modifying the last three dr by +6. Each of these Final dr represents a numerical grid coordinate of the Bombardment area which is immune to its effects. Should any of these Final dr result in the same number or exceed 10, the total area spared the effects of the Bombardment is correspondingly less. A Final dr of 10 also spares all hexes of the Bombardment area that have a coordinate of 0 (see <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.2" class="topiclink">A2.2</a>). For Deluxe ASL see <a href="chj_chapj.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">J2.5</a>.</p>

<p><a id="1.82"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.82 EFFECTS:</span> All non-Aerial Personnel units and Vulnerable PRC not in the spared hexes must take a 2MC prior to the start of play (thus passing the 2MC has no effect on HIP/&quot;?&quot; status). However, the TEM of their Location is added to their MC DR as a negative DRM (e.g., -4: entrenchment; +1: woods [Air Bursts]; -3: entrenchment in woods; 0: Open Ground). The +1 DRM for each non-rooftop level of a building above it (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.32" class="topiclink">B23.32</a>) does not apply. A -2 DRM applies if in Marsh. Otherwise, all rules for, and consequences of, a MC apply in the normal manner <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: each Personnel unit whose MC DR is Original Doubles &lt; 12 suffers Casualty Reduction if it also fails that MC]</span>; <a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">A10.31</a> applies to an Original 12. Hidden/concealed Personnel that break or become pinned must be completely revealed regardless of enemy LOS (thus eliminating a Dummy stack). All Horses, Motorcycles, and Boats not in the spared hexes are eliminated; their Passengers/Riders must Bail Out (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.24" class="topiclink">D6.24</a>), and then must take the Bombardment 2MC. CH are not applicable during Bombardment.</p>
<p><a id="1.821"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.821 EQUIPMENT:</span> Vehicles (and SW/Guns, in some instances) not in the spared hexes must take a NMC <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Horses, Motorcycles, and Boats do not take MC; they are affected as per <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.82" class="topiclink">1.82</a>]</span>. Unarmored vehicles have a Morale Level of 6, Guns and SW have a Morale Level of 7, all OT AFV and those CT AFV with all AF ≤ 4 have a Morale Level of 8, and all other CT AFV have a Morale Level of 9. There is no Pin, or reversed TEM (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.82" class="topiclink">1.82</a>), effect. Each vehicle must take its MC before its occupants do. A possessed SW/Gun takes the NMC only if its possessor breaks/suffers-Casualty-Reduction; if unpossessed when attacked by the Bombardment, it must always take the NMC. Failing a MC by one immobilizes vehicles, and malfunctions SW and non-vehicular ordnance. Failing the MC by two eliminates it, and a destroyed vehicle's PRC must roll for Survival (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>/<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.9" class="topiclink">D6.9</a>; those that survive are not attacked again by the Bombardment). A vehicle failing a MC by ≥ three results in a burning wreck.</p>
<p><a id="1.822"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.822 TERRAIN:</span> Each building/bridge hex not in the spared hexes must take a NMC before any of its occupants do. Wooden buildings/bridges (and pontoon bridges) have a Morale Level of 8, and stone buildings/bridges have a Morale Level of 9. Completely Fortified building hexes <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Factory]</span> may increase their Morale Level by one. A &quot;brown&quot; pillbox has a Morale Level of 10; a &quot;grey&quot; pillbox has a Morale Level of 11. One level of the building (from top down) is turned to rubble for every multiple of one by which the MC is failed (a bridge would be treated as a Single Story House). All occupants of a rubbled level are eliminated (also check for Falling Rubble; <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.12" class="topiclink">B24.12</a>). Wire and Roadblock counters, as well as all minefields, have a Morale Level of 9, and are eliminated if they fail their NMC; if hidden, they take their NMC and any eliminations are noted on the owner's side record (without telling his opponent what was eliminated or where such occurred). If a unit in a sangar is eliminated, so is that sangar (see the last sentence of <a href="chf_chf8.htm#8.41" class="topiclink">F8.41</a>).</p>
<p><a id="1.823"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.823 FIRE/SHELLHOLES:</span> Whenever any Bombardment MC DR is an Original 12, make a subsequent dr. If this dr is ≤ 4 a Shellhole counter is placed at the Base Level of that hex, provided such placement is otherwise legal; if the dr is ≥ 3 a Flame is placed in the same manner; if the dr is 3 or 4, place one of each. Bombardment may place no more than one of each type per hex.</p>
<p><a id="1.9"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.9 ROCKET OBA: </span>Rocket DBA is available only to certain nationalities (see the DYO OBA Battery Availability Charts) and only by SSR or DYO-purchase. No SR is placed nor is a FFE subject to Correction. Rocket OBA never receives more than one Fire Mission per battery. Rocketry is inaccurate and consequently never gets the benefit of an Accuracy dr; Error is automatic (although Extent of Error may be halved by Pre-Registered Fire). After gaining Battery Access, the firer merely places his AR (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.21" class="topiclink">1.21</a> applies), rolls for Error, and places his FFE. Rocket OBA has the same Blast Area as Harassing Fire but is resolved with full FR Rocket OBA cannot use Harassing Fire, Barrage, IR or SMOKE.</p>
