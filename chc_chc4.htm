<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">4. GUN &amp; AMMO TYPE BASIC TH# MODIFICATIONS</span></h1>
<p>[Gun and Ammo Type modifications are distinct from all others because they modify the Basic TH#—not the To Hit DR—to achieve the Modified TH#. The distinction is very important and care should be taken not to lump these modifications together with a DRM.]</p>
<p><a id="4.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.1 &nbsp;BARREL LENGTH:</span> Put simply, the longer the gun barrel (or tube), the more accurate a weapon is at greater ranges. Therefore, all ordnance weapons (including SW MTR, INF, RCL, and 20L ATR, but not MG/LATW) are rated for tube length as being either short (*), normal (no suffix), long (L), or extra long (LL). Normal length tubes have no effect on the Basic TH# of that Gun, but all other types are subject to modification of their Basic TH# when firing at a range &gt; 12 hexes. Barrel Length does not affect any resulting To Kill DR; the added lethality of the longer tubes is built into the To Kill Tables.</p>
<p><a id="4.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.11 &nbsp;*:</span> Short-barreled weapons must subtract one from their Basic TH# when firing at a range &gt; 12 hexes.</p>
<p><a id="4.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.12 L:</span> Long barreled weapons must add one to their Basic TH# when firing at a range &gt; 12 hexes.</p>
<p><a id="4.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.13 LL:</span> Extra-long barreled weapons must add one to their Basic TH# when firing at a range &gt; 12 hexes, or must add two to their Basic TH# when firing at a range &gt; 24 hexes.</p>
<p><a id="4.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.2 &nbsp;SMALL CALIBERS:</span> Smaller shells generally lost velocity faster than larger shells, affecting trajectory, stability, and ultimately, accuracy. Any weapon (including MG) ≤ 57mm is subject to a -1 modification to its Basic TH# for every 12 hexes (or fraction thereof) beyond 12 hex range. All weapons <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> ≤ 40mm is subject to an additional -1 modification to its Basic TH# at &gt; 12 hex range.</p>
<p><a id="4.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.3 APCR/APDS:</span> APCR ammunition was less accurate at long range due to the poor ratio of weight to diameter. APDS ammunition was also less accurate at long range due to the separation of the sabot from the core. Therefore, the Basic TH# of any shot using APCR/APDS is lessened by one for every 12 hexes (or fraction thereof) beyond 12 hex range. The German 28LL and 40LL Guns use the APCR Basic TH# Modification even if firing HE, and are not subject to APCR Depletion Numbers (<a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">8.2</a>).</p>
<p><a id="4.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.4 SMOKE:</span> Ordnance using the <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C3</a> To Hit Table to fire SMOKE at ≤ 12 hexes must add two to its Basic TH#.</p>
<p><a id="4.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.5 MODIFIED TH#:</span> All Gun &amp; Ammo Type modifications are cumulative and transform the BASIC TH# to a MODIFIED TH#. All other factors affecting the To Hit process are DRM which affect the To Hit DR, not the TH#.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A German 4.2cm le PaK 41 (40LL) firing APCR at a tank 25 hexes away has a Basic TH# of 6, but a Modified TH# of 3 (+2 [LL] -2 [APCR] -2 [≤ 57mm] -1 [≤ 40mm] = -3).</span></p>
