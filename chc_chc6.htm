Within this restriction, all MF/MP thusly expended by the target in that Location before the firer takes his first shot may (must, if engaging in a Gun Duel; <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.2401" class="topiclink">2.2401</a>) be used to minimize the application of Case J<span style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: super;">1</span>/J<span style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: super;">2</span> DRM to that first shot, or (if not engaging in a Gun Duel) may be applied in increments to a series of shots at it.</p>

Area Acquisition follows all the principles of ½&quot; counter Acquisition except as specified otherwise. An Area Acquired counter applies to all non-Aerial units and terrain which are currently in the acquirer's LOS in that Acquired counter's hex (unlike a ½&quot; Acquired counter, which cannot apply in more than one Location). Using the Area Target Type, a Gun can fire on a hex not containing a Known enemy unit; Area Acquisition can be gained on that hex, and can be used vs any (even subsequent/unknown) occupants of that hex which are in that firer's LOS when he fires. An Area Acquired counter cannot track a moving/routing/advancing/Withdrawing unit as per <a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.51" class="topiclink">6.51</a>; the firer would have to reacquire such a unit each time it enters a new hex.

Using the Infantry Target Type, the tank can fire at either Level 1 or Level 2 of the building; barring malfunction, it will gain Acquisition on Level 2 if it fires at that squad—but if it fires at the squad on Level 1 it can acquire it only if it achieves a &quot;PTC&quot; or better result on the IFT. Alternatively, it can use the Area Target Type to fire at (and acquire) both Levels 1 and 2. In neither case however, can it affect the squad at Level 0 (except via rubble), which is out of its LOS. The tank uses the Area Target Type to fire (and thus has no Multiple ROF; <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">3.33</a>), so a -1 Area Acquired counter is placed above the Level 1 counter. Assuming the situation remains unchanged through the beginning of its PFPh, the tank can now fire again on the Area Target Type at M2 with the -1 Acquisition DRM, or it can transfer that DRM to a ½&quot; Acquired counter and use it with the Infantry Target Type to fire at level 2. It cannot transfer the DRM to use with the Infantry Target Type to fire at Level 1 if the squad on Level 1 is still concealed; if it fires at this squad, its prior Acquisition is lost (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.52" class="topiclink">6.52</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the tank has a Stabilized Gun, it can forego attacking in the PFPh and instead move to L3, where it can use Bounding First Fire to attack one level of M2. It will retain its Acquisition DRM for this attack, but must transfer it to the Infantry Target Type (using a ½&quot; Acquired counter) when it announces the attack (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.55" class="topiclink">6.55</a>). It cannot use (and will lose) its Acquisition DRM if it attacks the concealed squad on Level 1—but it can attack the unconcealed squad on Level 0 using its Acquisition DRM, because it had Area Acquisition in that hex when this squad came into the tank's LOS (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.52" class="topiclink">6.52</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Now assume that instead of firing during Final Fire, the M4/76 fired on the Area Target Type during its Defensive First Fire when the squad shown on Level 2 of M2 originally entered that Location. Both Levels 1 and 2 would be acquired, and this DRM would still apply at both levels if that squad then descended to Level 1 (or if the squad at Level 0 ascended to Level 1) and the tank fired again on the Area Target Type. However, if the squad moved from Level 2 of M2 into N2 it would no longer be acquired, nor could the tank transfer its Area Acquired counter to a ½&quot; Acquired counter to track that squad into N2.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If instead the tank had fired on the Infantry Target Type to attack the 4-6-7 when it entered Level 2 of M2, it would have gained a -1 ½&quot; Acquisition counter which would follow the squad when it moves to Level 2 of N2; when the squad moves to Level 2 of N1, the ½&quot; Acquisition counter would stay at Level 2 of N2.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the tank then used Area Target Type vs hex N2, it could transfer the Acquisition DRM and replace the ½&quot; Acquisition counter with a ⅝&quot; Acquisition counter.</span></p>
