<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">1. VEHICLE COUNTERS</span></h1>
<p>[All vehicles are represented by ⅝&quot; counters bearing an overhead depiction of the vehicle (which for most is drawn to a scale roughly corresponding to the hex size of Deluxe ASL) and an assortment of data pertaining to its size, movement, defense, and attack strengths. Although all vehicles have that information listed in chart form in their respective nationality's Vehicle Listing, the most commonly used data can be determined from the graphic layout of the counter. See also <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.9" class="topiclink">C2.9</a>.]</p>
<p><a id="1.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.1 MOVEMENT TYPE:</span> For land movement purposes there are five types of vehicles (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.11" class="topiclink">1.11-.15</a>). Each <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Motorcycle]</span> is readily identified by the shape of the white symbol behind the large MP number in the upper right-hand corner of the counter. Any numerical superscript to the right of the MP number represents the vehicle's amphibious MP allotment (<a href="chd_chd16.htm#16.2" class="topiclink">16.2</a>); the movement type of the vehicle on land is still determined normally. If the MP number is printed in red, the vehicle is prone to mechanical breakdown (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">2.5</a>).</p>
<p><a id="1.11"></a><img src="d11.gif" width="72" height="72" alt="d11" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.11 MOTORCYCLE:</span> A vehicle classified as a Motorcycle for movement purposes is recognizable by its white counter and its obvious overhead depiction.</p>
<p><a id="1.12"></a><img src="d112.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="d112" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.12 ARMORED CAR:</span> A vehicle classified as an Armored Car for movement purposes is recognizable by the white circular background (representing a wheel) behind its MP number (EX: German PSW 234/1 armored car).</p>
<p><a id="1.13"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_4f01fb0a.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="PZKPFW IVH" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.13 FULLY TRACKED:</span> A vehicle classified as Fully Tracked for movement purposes is recognizable by the white oval (representing a track) behind its MP number (EX: German PzKpfw IVH tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.14"></a><img src="spw251-1.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="SPW251-1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.14 HALF-TRACKED:</span> A vehicle classified as a Halftrack for movement purposes is recognizable by the white combination circle-oval (representing a track and a wheel) behind its MP number (EX: German SPW 251/1 halftrack).</p>
<p><a id="1.15"></a><img src="d115.gif" width="142" height="72" alt="d115" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.15 TRUCK:</span> A vehicle classified as a Truck for movement purposes is recognizable by the white double circles &quot;figure eight&quot; symbol (representing two wheels) behind its MP number (EX: Russian GAZ-MM truck; Russian BA-20 armored car).</p>
<p><a id="1.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.2 ARMOR STATUS:</span> Every vehicle falls into at least one of four Armor status categories. If a vehicle has any armor (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6</a>) it is referred to as an Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV) and is subject to many special rules. The main advantage of an AFV is that it cannot be harmed by Small Arms on the IFT (although its PRC may be Vulnerable to such fire in certain situations) unless struck through an unarmored Target Facing/Aspect.</p>
<p><a id="1.21"></a><img src="d121.gif" width="140" height="69" alt="d121" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.21 UNARMORED:</span> An unarmored vehicle is recognizable by the presence of two  ★ symbols (in red, white or black) vertically aligned beneath the MP number (EX: German Opel truck; German SdKfz 7 halftrack). AFV can be treated as unarmored vehicles vs certain types of attack; see <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.311" class="topiclink">5.311</a> and <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.42" class="topiclink">B28.42</a>.</p>
<p><a id="1.22"></a><img src="d122.gif" width="73" height="70" alt="d122" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.22 PARTIALLY ARMORED:</span> An AFV that has armor protection along only its front and side Target Facings is recognizable by the presence of a ★ symbol along the right-hand margin beneath its Side/Rear AF. If a &quot;T&quot; appears beside the ★, only the turret/upper-superstructure Aspect (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.9" class="topiclink">C3.9</a>) of the rear Target Facing is unarmored (EX: German Marder III(t)H).</p>
<p><a id="1.23"></a><img src="spw251-1.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="SPW251-1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.23 OPEN-TOPPED (OT):</span> An AFV whose entire overhead depiction is printed on a white background is an OT AFV (EX: German SPW 251/1 halftrack).</p>
<p><a id="1.24"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_4f01fb0a.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="PZKPFW IVH" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.24 CLOSED-TOPPED (CT):</span> An AFV with neither a ★, nor a white background for its overhead depiction, is a CT AFV (EX: German PzKpfw IVH tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.3 MAIN ARMAMENT (MA) TYPE:</span> Each armed vehicle has one MA Inherent weapon. The MA is shown as a large number representing its MA Gun Caliber Size (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">C2.21</a>), or by the appropriate acronym for its MA MG, FT or ATR, in the bottom left-hand corner of the counter. The MA is either turret-mounted (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.31" class="topiclink">1.31-.322</a>) or bow-mounted (i.e., non-turreted; <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.33" class="topiclink">1.33</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: MA AAMG; <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.83" class="topiclink">1.83</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="1.31"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_4f01fb0a.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="PZKPFW IVH" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.31 FAST TURRET TRAVERSE (T):</span> Any MA of the &quot;T&quot; Type (which generally represents a three-man turret crew) is recognizable by a large but thin white circle on the counter (EX: German PzKpfw IVH tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.32"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_2e8e2c8d.gif" width="68" height="71" alt="PZKFPW VG" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.32 SLOW TURRET TRAVERSE (ST):</span> Any MA of the &quot;ST&quot; Type (which generally represents a two-man turret crew or heavy, manual-traverse turret) is recognizable by a large but thin white square on the counter (EX: German Panther tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.321"></a><img src="d1321.gif" width="71" height="69" alt="d1321" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.321 RESTRICTED SLOW TRAVERSE (RST):</span> Some tanks of the ST Type<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chd_chdfootnotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">1</a></span> had a turret/crew arrangement such that the MA and CMG could not be used while the commander was CE. Such a MA Type is termed &quot;RST&quot; (symbolized by a large thick white square), and is considered a ST Type but can fire neither its MA nor its CMG while CE (EX: Russian BT-5 tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.322"></a><img src="d1322.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="d1322" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.322 ONE-MAN TURRET (1MT):</span> Any MA of the &quot;1MT&quot; Type is recognized by a large thick white square with no corners (EX: German PzKpfw IB tank). A 1MT AFV is considered a ST Type, but can fire neither its MA nor its CMG while CE. In addition, any 1MT AFV that is Stunned is automatically Recalled (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">5.341</a>) and may not become CE for the remainder of its time onboard.</p>
<p><a id="1.33"></a><img src="d133.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="d133" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.33 NON-TURRETED (NT): </span>Any MA of the &quot;NT' Type <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: MA AAMG; <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.83" class="topiclink">1.83</a>]</span> is recognizable by having no MA Type white circle/square on the counter (EX: German StuG IIIB assault gun). All bow-mounted weapons fall into this category.</p>
<p><a id="1.34"></a><img src="d134.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="d134" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.34 SECONDARY ARMAMENT (SA):</span> Some vehicles have a SA weapon, which is indicated on the counter in the same manner as, but above and in a smaller typeface than, the MA [EXC: the SA is prefixed with a &quot;T&quot; if turret-mounted or a &quot;B&quot; if bow-mounted] (EX: Italian M11/39 tank). A weapon must also be specifically listed in the SA column of that vehicle's entry line in its Vehicle Listing in order to be considered SA.</p>
<p><a id="1.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.4 IDENTITY &amp; GROUND PRESSURE:</span> Each vehicle is identified by name (sometimes in shortened form) beside its overhead depiction, and individually by letter in the upper left-hand corner of the counter. The ID letter is used to identify different vehicles of the same type for record-keeping/Target-Acquisition—(<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.58" class="topiclink">C6.58</a>) purposes. Each vehicle's Ground Pressure is listed as Low, Normal or High for Bog DR (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.21" class="topiclink">8.21</a>) purposes.</p>
<p><a id="1.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.41 &nbsp;LOW GROUND PRESSURE:</span> Any vehicle whose ID letter is encased in a square has Low Ground Pressure (EX: German PzKpfw 1B tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.42 NORMAL GROUND PRESSURE:</span> Any vehicle whose ID letter is not encased in a circle or square has Normal Ground Pressure (EX: German StuG IIIB assault gun).</p>
<p><a id="1.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.43 HIGH GROUND PRESSURE:</span> Any vehicle whose ID letter is encased in a circle has High Ground Pressure (EX: Russian BA-20 armored car).</p>
<p><a id="1.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.5 TOWING (T#)/PORTAGE (#PP):</span> If a vehicle is allowed to tow a Gun, its counter will have a &quot;T#&quot; to indicate how heavy a Gun it can tow (<a href="chc_chc10.htm" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>). If a vehicle can carry Personnel/SW as Passengers, its counter will be marked in the form &quot;#PP&quot; to indicate the vehicle's maximum Passenger capacity (<a href="chd_chd6.htm" class="topiclink">6.1</a>).</p>
<p><a id="1.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.6 ARMOR FACTOR (AF):</span> Every AFV is rated as to the quality of its armor protection for both its front and side/rear Target Facings, as well as for both its hull and turret/upper-superstructure aspects, by the two numbers vertically aligned beneath its MP number. Armor is given a rating called an AF.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chd_chdfootnotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">2</a></span> There are 11 different AF in the game: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 18, 26. Unless Partially-Armored, each AFV actually has four AF (which may or may not differ from each other): one each for its front (i.e., for the front Target Facing of its) hull, front turret/upper-superstructure, side/rear hull, and side/rear turret/upper-superstructure.</p>
<p><a id="1.61"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.61 &nbsp;FRONT ARMOR:</span> The upper printed AF is the AFV's front hull AF and, unless encased in a box or circle (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.63" class="topiclink">1.63-.64</a>), is also its front turret/upper-superstructure AF.</p>
<p><a id="1.62"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.62 &nbsp;SIDE/REAR ARMOR:</span> The lower printed AF is the AFV's side/rear hull AF and, unless encased in a box or circle (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.63" class="topiclink">1.63-.64</a>), is also its side/rear turret/upper-superstructure AF.</p>
<p><a id="1.63"></a><img src="d163.gif" width="71" height="71" alt="d163" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.63 SUPERIOR TURRET:</span> A printed AF encased in a square indicates that the AFV's turret/upper-superstructure AF for that Target Facing is &gt; that hull AF. The Superior-Turret AF is calculated by increasing that printed AF to the next-higher AF value given in <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The front hull AF of the German StuPz IV is 11, but its front upper-superstructure AF is 14. Its side/rear hull AF is 3, but its side/rear upper-superstructure AF is 4.</span></p>
<p><a id="1.64"></a><img src="d164.gif" width="72" height="72" alt="d164" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.64 INFERIOR TURRET:</span> A printed AF encased in a circle indicates that the AFV's turret/upper-superstructure AF for that Target Facing is &lt; that hull AF. The Inferior-Turret AF is calculated by decreasing that printed AF to the next-lower AF value given in <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The front hull AF of the Russian T-50 tank is 6, but its front turret AF is 4. Its side/rear hull AF is 4, but its side/rear turret AF is 3.</span></p>
<p><a id="1.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.7 TARGET SIZE:</span> All vehicles are rated for one of five possible Target Sizes, as follows:</p>
<p><a id="1.71"></a><img src="d171.gif" width="73" height="71" alt="d171" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.71 VERY LARGE:</span> A vehicle whose upper and lower AF (or ★ symbols) are both red is subject to a -2 Case P To Hit DRM when fired on (EX: German PzJg Tiger TD).</p>
<p><a id="1.72"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_2e8e2c8d.gif" width="68" height="71" alt="PZKFPW VG" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.72 LARGE:</span> A vehicle whose upper AF (or ★ symbol) is red is subject to a -1 Case P To Hit DRM when fired on (EX: German Panther tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.73"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_4f01fb0a.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="PZKPFW IVH" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.73 AVERAGE:</span> A vehicle whose upper and lower AF (or ★ symbols) are both black is subject to no Case P To Hit DRM when fired on (EX: German PzKpfw IVH tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.74"></a><img src="d174.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="d174" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.74 SMALL:</span> A vehicle whose upper AF is printed on a white dot (or whose upper ★ symbol is white) is eligible for a +1 Case P To Hit DRM when fired on (EX: German PzKpfw IIF tank).</p>
<p><a id="1.75"></a><img src="d175.gif" width="73" height="71" alt="d175" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1.75 VERY SMALL:</span> A vehicle whose upper and lower AF are each printed on a white dot (or whose ★ symbols are both white) is eligible for a +2 Case P To Hit DRM when fired on (EX: German Kfz 1 Kuebelwagen).</p>
<p><a id="1.76"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.76 CONCEALMENT:</span> If a vehicle is concealed, special rules apply concerning its Target Size TH DRM, see <a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.2" class="topiclink">A12.2</a>.</p>
<p><a id="1.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.8 &nbsp;VEHICULAR MG/FT:</span> <a href="d1_8_vehicular_mg.htm" class="topiclink">D1.8 Vehicular MG</a> &nbsp;A vehicle with Inherent MG armament is identified by the MG FP factors printed in the lower right-hand corner in the configuration &quot;b/c/a&quot;, with b = Bow MG FP, c = Coaxial MG FP, and a = AAMG FP. If no AAMG is present, the shortened form &quot;b/c&quot; is used. If a vehicle has an Inherent FT, its mounting configuration (B = Bow NT; T = Turret; S = Side-hull [see the pertinent Vehicle Note]), FP, and X# are printed in red; if the FP is underscored, its Normal Range is two hexes (see <a href="cha_cha22.htm" class="topiclink">A22.1</a>).</p>
<p><a id="1.81"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.81 BOW MG (BMG):</span> A BMG is a bow-mounted MG, and thus may fire only at a target that lies within its vehicle's VCA <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: see <a href="chd_chd4.htm#4.223" class="topiclink">4.223</a>, <a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.5" class="topiclink">8.5</a> and <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.6" class="topiclink">C2.6</a>]</span>. The Normal Range of a BMG is eight hexes. A few AFV have a hull RMG (Rear MG), which is represented by an &quot;R#&quot; superscript after the BMG FP. A hull RMG is equivalent to a BMG <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: it may fire only at a target that lies either within its rear hull Target Facing or in its own hex but not in OVR]</span>. A BMG factor printed over a white dot represents a Fixed-Mount MG, which receives a +1 DRM to all fire at a moving unit (including moving vehicular target; <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.8" class="topiclink">C.8</a>).</p>
<p><a id="1.82"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.82 &nbsp;COAXIAL MG (CMG):</span> The CMG FP may be used only when firing through the TCA. The Normal Range of a CMG is 12 hexes. Use of a CMG against other than an acquired target causes loss of any preexisting Acquisition (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">C6.5</a>) by the MA. Some AFV have a turret Rear MG which is reflected by the supercript &quot;R#&quot; after the CMG FP. A turret Rear MG has a Normal Range of eight hexes, may not be used in OVR or the same phase in which the MA fires, and can fire only through its rear turret Target Facing or at a target in the same hex (see <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">3.5</a>). If a vehicle's CMG is restricted to firing only through its VCA (shown by &quot;CMG: VCA Only&quot; on the counter back), that CMG may not be used to attack in CC but it does serve to void the -1 CC DRM for an attack vs a vehicle &quot;without manned, functioning MG armament&quot; (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.51" class="topiclink">A11.51</a>). Mandatory Fire Direction (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">A9.4</a>) does not apply to CMG.</p>
<p><a id="1.83"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.83 ANTI-AIRCRAFT MG (AAMG):</span> The AAMG FP may be used either within or outside of its vehicular current TCA/VCA at no penalty; i.e., for rules purposes it is considered neither &quot;turret-mounted&quot; nor &quot;bow-mounted&quot; (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.51" class="topiclink">3.51</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: AAMG with restricted CA (e.g., German StuG IIIG or French H35) must pay the applicable Case A penalty for changing TCA/VCA as appropriate]</span>. Unlike the BMG/CMG FP of a CT AFV or any MG on an unarmored vehicle, an AFV AAMG must be manned by CE (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">5.3</a>) crew members in order to be used; a BU AFV cannot use its AAMG FP (although a Hero could do so in either case; <a href="cha_cha15.htm#15.23" class="topiclink">A15.23</a>). The Normal Range of an AAMG is eight hexes.</p>
<p><a id="1.84"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.84 OPTIONAL ARMAMENT:</span> Some vehicles have different armament assortments. Procedures for purchasing such added armament in DYO scenarios are provided in <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">H1.41</a>. However, in official scenarios only the armament configuration illustrated in the scenario OB is available unless the number of such vehicles required exceeds the number provided in the game, in which case the excess can be composed of vehicles with optional armament (of the owner's choice) provided that armament is available within that time frame.</p>
<p><a id="1.9"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.9 &nbsp;WRECK:</span> Most vehicles have a wreck depiction on a white background on their reverse side. If no wreck is depicted on the reverse of the counter, it (and any attendant fire/smoke) is removed from play when the vehicle is eliminated. The reverse of each counter also lists special information pertinent to that counter: Special Ammunition Depletion Numbers (<a href="chc_chc8.htm" class="topiclink">C8</a>), Gyrostabilizer (<a href="chd_chd11.htm" class="topiclink">11.1</a>), Smoke Dispensers (<a href="chd_chd13.htm" class="topiclink">13</a>), Crew Survival Number (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">5.6-.7</a>), lack of radio (<a href="chd_chd14.htm" class="topiclink">14</a>), and other miscellaneous notes.</p>
