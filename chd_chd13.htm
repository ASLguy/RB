<p><a id="13.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.1 &nbsp;TYPES:</span> Smoke Dischargers (sD), Smoke Mortars (sM), Smoke Pots (sP), and the Nahverteidigungswaffe (sN) are all vehicular smoke dispensers. An AFV is equipped with such only if the reverse side of its counter contains the appropriate abbreviation followed by a Usage Number; e.g., &quot;sD7&quot;. The abbreviation indicates the type of smoke dispenser carried, and the Usage Number represents the abstracted probability (in terms of equipage, damage, loaded status, and crew awareness) that it can fire when its owner wishes. These Usage Numbers replace normal Breakdown and Ammunition Depletion rules. A smoke dispenser is not considered a weapon <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: sN in CC]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="13.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.2 USAGE: </span>An AFV may attempt to dispense smoke once per Player Turn during the MPh—but only if that AFV is not Abandoned, its crew is not stunned, shocked, or broken, and the AFV/PRC has not yet fired (including Bounding or Defensive First Fire) any weapon during that Player Turn. Firing (see <a href="chd_chd13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">13.3</a>) a smoke dispenser costs one MP during an AFV's own MPh, but there is no MP cost for a usage attempt which fails to result in the smoke dispenser being fired. The one MP expenditure for smoke dispenser firing cannot coincide with any MP expenditure for any other use. During the opponent's MPh, a smoke dispenser usage attempt can be made following any MP/MF expenditure by an opposing unit in the vehicle's LOS as if it were intervening with Defensive First Fire.</p>

<p><a id="13.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.3 &nbsp;FIRING:</span> When a player wishes his AFV to attempt smoke dispenser use, he makes a DR (∆). If that Final DR is ≤ its Usage Number, it has fired and a smoke counter is placed as per the applicable rule (below) for the type of dispenser used. If the Final DR is &gt; the Usage Number, it did not fire (and smoke was not placed), but the player is free to have this AFV attempt such use again in another Player Turn. A BU AFV must add a +1 DRM to its Smoke Dispenser Usage DR <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: sN firing HE in the CCPh; <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.622" class="topiclink">A11.622</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="13.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.31 sD:</span> A successfully fired sD places white dispersed smoke at the Base Level of the AFV's own hex.</p>
<p><a id="13.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.32 sM:</span> A successfully fired sM places dispersed white smoke at the Base Level of any hex of the firer's choice that is at a range of 1-3 hexes from the AFV, is within its TCA and in its LOS. Whenever an AFV changes its CA to fire its sM, the appropriate Case A TH DRM applies to the sM Usage DR. During the AFV's MPh that Case A DRM would not also apply to subsequent Bounding First Fire by CA-restricted weapons in that new CA (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.13" class="topiclink">C5.13</a>), but during the opponent's MPh it would apply (as per <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.51" class="topiclink">3.51</a>) to subsequent Defensive First Fire by such weapons. However, in all cases the CA actually changes (and that Case A DRM will apply to those Defensive First Fire attacks) only if the sM successfully fires. A moving/Non-Stopped (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.8" class="topiclink">C.8</a>) AFV must add a +2 DRM to its sM Usage DR. Hindrance DRM between the AFV's hex and the hex it wishes to place smoke in also apply to that DR (including a subsequent dr for Dust if necessary; <a href="chf_chf11.htm#11.7" class="topiclink">F11.7</a>). An AFV may not fire sM from inside a building or from within dense jungle.</p>
<p><a id="13.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.33 sP:</span> An AFV's Inherent crew must be CE to attempt sP usage. A successfully fired sP places white dispersed smoke at the Base Level of the AFV's own hex.</p>
<p><a id="13.34"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.34 &nbsp;sN:</span> An AFV must always be BU to use its sN. A successfully fired sN places white dispersed smoke at the Base Level of the AFV's own hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: HE use during CC; <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.622" class="topiclink">A11.622</a>]</span>. If the sN Usage Number takes the form &quot;#4#5&quot; , the sN uses the left-hand # for a scenario set in 7-12/44 (inclusive) and the right-hand # in 1945.</p>
<p><a id="13.35"></a><img src="smokeinf.gif" width="61" height="61" alt="SMOKEINF" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13.35 VEHICULAR SMOKE GRENADES:</span> The crews of almost all armed vehicles carried smoke grenades for self protection. Therefore, the Inherent Crew (or HS) of any vehicle with a MA weapon indicated on its counter may place Smoke Grenades (<a href="cha_cha24.htm" class="topiclink">A24.1</a>) using the same rules as attempting to fire a Smoke Dispenser (<a href="chd_chd13.htm#13.2" class="topiclink">13.2-.3</a>), with the following exceptions: A CT AFV crew must be CE to attempt placement; a usage dr of &quot;1&quot; is necessary for successful placement by an armed-but-unarmored vehicle or BU OT AFV, or of &quot;≤ 2&quot; for any CE AFV (a &quot;6&quot; dr has no effect beyond prohibiting placement); if successfully placed, a ½&quot; Smoke counter is placed in the vehicle's own Location and treated as per <a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.11" class="topiclink">A24.11</a>; if placed during the opponent's MPh, the Smoke counter is removed at the end of that phase. Vehicular smoke grenades may not be used in any other way by PRC, nor may they be Removed/Scrounged. A vehicle may attempt to use vehicular smoke grenades or a smoke dispenser, but not both, during the same MPh.</p>
