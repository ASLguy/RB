<p><a id="16.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.1</span> A DD tank is amphibious only while its screens are erect.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chd_chdfootnotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">13</a></span> Should the vehicle be hit by any non-Dud ordnance-fired HE/HEAT while on land, the screens are considered worthless thereafter—regardless of the outcome of the To Kill DR.</p>
<p><a id="16.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.11</span> The screens may be dropped automatically from inside the AFV during any friendly MPh in which it is on a land hex or is Wading (<a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.42" class="topiclink">G13.42</a>).</p>
<p><a id="16.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.12</span> DD tanks must be CE to move with screens erect and may not fire, use VBM, carry Riders, or occupy any building, rubble, woods, brush, or orchard hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: woods roads and orchard roads]</span> while screens are erect. The COT of any land hex is increased by one while screens are erect.</p>
<p><a id="16.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.2</span> Amphibians engage their land movement rate when moving from a Water Obstacle to a land hex and vice versa. Amphibians may use a combination of their amphibious and land MP in the same MPh; for every amphibious MP used, the vehicle loses half of its land MP allotment (the land MP loss is one-third for those amphibious vehicles with a water mode MP rate of three), and vice versa. Use of even a half land MP causes the loss of an amphibious MP. An amphibious vehicle in a Water Obstacle is always in Motion unless stunned or shocked. A stunned or shocked amphibian in a Water Obstacle must expend an amphibious MP in its current hex to start movement again.</p>
<p><a id="16.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.21</span> &nbsp;Cost of movement into a Water Obstacle (not Marsh; <a href="chb_chb16.htm#16.42" class="topiclink">B16.42</a>) is one amphibious MP. See <a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.13" class="topiclink">B21.13</a> for crossing an all-water hexside into a non-Water Obstacle hex.</p>
<p><a id="16.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.22</span> &nbsp;Amphibians must drift (<a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.121" class="topiclink">B21.121</a>) in the APh as per the type of current in force. An immobilized amphibian in a Water Obstacle drifts as long as it is in a hex affected by current.</p>
<p><a id="16.23"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.23</span> &nbsp;Amphibians must check for Bog (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">8.2</a>) in waterline hexes when moving from Water Obstacle to land hexes.</p>
<p><a id="16.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.3</span> &nbsp;An amphibian in a Water Obstacle (not marsh) always presents a Very Small target size (+2 TH; <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.75" class="topiclink">1.75</a>) as well as being HD. The HD status is not applicable to any firer with an elevation advantage over the target which is &gt; the range to that target.</p>
<p><a id="16.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.4</span> A DD tank or unarmored amphibian (such as the DUKW) receiving fire in a Water Obstacle defends as an unarmored vehicle on the IFT, but non-ordnance FP against it is halved. A non-DD amphibious AFV (such as the LVT4) is immune to Small Arms Fire (although any Vulnerable PRC are not), and must be destroyed on an AFV Kill Table or by Indirect Fire in order to be sunk.</p>
<p><a id="16.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.5</span> Any amphibian eliminated in a Water Obstacle is considered sunk and leaves no wreck. The crew/Passengers of a sunk amphibian are automatically eliminated.</p>
<p><a id="16.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.6</span> An amphibian presents no LOS Hindrance while in a Water Obstacle.</p>
<p><a id="16.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.7</span> An amphibian may not carry Riders while in a Water Obstacle.</p>
<p><a id="16.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.8</span> Because of their vulnerability, DD tanks and unarmored amphibians were kept well out of sight until such time as they were to actually enter the water. Therefore, such vehicles—even if listed as part of the setup OB in a scenario—may remain offboard until their owner wishes them to enter during a friendly MPh.</p>
