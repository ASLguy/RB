<p>Most of the mechanics for AFV combat are covered by the rules of ordnance in Chapter C.</p>
<p><a id="3.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">3.1 COVERED ARC (CA):</span> A vehicle possessing turreted armament actually has two CA: a Vehicular CA for movement and bow-mounted weapons, and a Turret CA for turret-mounted weapons. The <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">C3.2</a> definition of CA is applicable to both but may be based on different points of reference, depending on the orientation of the counter.</p>
<p><a id="3.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">3.11 VEHICULAR COVERED ARC (VCA):</span> The VCA is identical to the CA defined in <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">C3.2</a>, and is used for all bow-mounted weapons and vehicle movement, as well as determining Target Facing for any hull hit vs the vehicle.</p>
<p><img src="d311ex.gif" width="300" height="223" alt="d311ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The VCA is outlined in red, the TCA is outlined in blue.</span></p>
<p><a id="3.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">3.12 TURRET COVERED ARC (TCA):</span> The TCA determines the Field of Fire of all turret-mounted weapons, and differs from the VCA only when a turret counter is placed on the vehicle with the Gun pointing toward a different hexspine than that of the vehicle counter. Should the TCA and VCA coincide and the vehicle is a BU CT (or CE OT) AFV, there is no need for a turret counter and it is removed. However, whenever a vehicle fires a turret-mounted weapon outside its VCA (To Hit Case A), the VCA is not changed (unless the vehicle uses the NT DRM application of Case A). Instead, a turret counter is placed so that the fired-on target lies within the TCA (see <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.51" class="topiclink">3.51</a>). The TCA may change as a result of firing a turret-mounted weapon outside its current TCA and the VCA may change for firing a turret/bow-mounted weapon outside its current VCA (Case A), or at the end of any friendly fire phase in which the AFV is eligible to fire (a turret-mounted weapon for TCA or turret/bow-mounted weapon for VCA) without using Intensive Fire (as per <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.22" class="topiclink">C3.22</a>). The TCA may also change freely with each MP expended during the MPh. The TCA change must be announced as the MP are expended but can coincide with MP expended for movement, stop, start, or Delay purposes; i.e., the MP cost for a TCA change is not in addition to other MP expenditures. The MP expenditure required for a TCA change during its MPh is doubled if in a woods or building obstacle (not Bypassing those obstacles or on a road) or rubble hex (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.11" class="topiclink">C5.11</a>). For Narrow Streets see <a href="chb_chb31.htm#31.12" class="topiclink">B31.12</a>. The Target Facing of any turret/upper superstructure hit is based on the target's TCA—not its VCA.</p>
<p><a id="3.2"></a><img src="d32.gif" width="188" height="198" alt="d32" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3.2 TARGET FACING:</span>  <a href="d3_2_target_facing.htm" class="topiclink">D3.2 Target Facing</a> &nbsp;When an AFV is hit it is necessary to determine the Target Facing of the AFV to determine what AF modifies the Modified TK#. Target Facing is determined as depicted in the diagram, depending on which target hexside is crossed by the firing unit's LOS. Note the difference in the procedure for determining Target Facing for a target in Bypass (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.32" class="topiclink">2.32</a>). If the LOS of the firing unit runs exactly along a hexspine of the target hex which determines Target Facing, the Target Facing is that least favorable to the attacker. If the fire originates from within the target hex (Case E To Hit DRM; <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">C5.5</a>) the colored dr of the To Hit DR determines the Target Facing: 1-2 Rear, 3-4 Side, 5-6 Front <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Bypass; <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.32" class="topiclink">2.32</a>]</span>. FT/MOL/DC attacks made from within the same hex attack the Rear Target Facing, even vs Bypass vehicles. In the diagram, the shot along the E7-F7 hexspine is vs the front Target Facing.</p>
<p><a id="3.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3.3 BOUNDING FIRST FIRE:</span> Vehicles are not eligible for Opportunity Fire (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.25" class="topiclink">A7.25</a>), but unlike Infantry, a vehicle/its Passengers/Riders may move and also fire (or vice versa) in its MPh; this is termed Bounding First Fire. Any vehicle that fires during its MPh is using Bounding First Fire and is marked with a Bounding Fire counter <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if the only weapon fired did not exhaust its Multiple ROF]</span>. However, to use Bounding First Fire, any vehicular ordnance must use one of the Case C To Hit DRM (either Case C, C<span style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: super;">1</span>, C<span style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: super;">2</span>, or C<span style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: super;">4</span>; see <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">C5.3-.33</a>, <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.35" class="topiclink">C5.35</a>). The vehicle can expend additional Delay MP while stopped (including at the outset of its MPh prior to movement) by announcing their expenditure one at a time. A vehicle may move again in the same MPh after using Bounding First Fire (or just stopping) provided it has sufficient MP (even to the extent of stopping and firing a Multiple ROF Gun again; see <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.24" class="topiclink">C2.24</a>). The DEFENDER can intervene to attempt Defensive First Fire after the announcement of expenditure of any MP (even Delay MP), but must do so before the announcement of the next MP expenditure or of Bounding First Fire; the target cannot be forced to return to a previously occupied hex or CA after it has announced a MP expenditure that legally changes its position. A vehicle (including its PRC) with either a Prep Fire or Bounding Fire counter cannot fire during its AFPh.</p>

However, if the vehicle did not exhaust its Multiple ROF during its MPh, and did not fire any other weapons (including PRC) during its MPh, it may fire that Multiple ROF weapon (only) again once (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">C5.3</a>) during its AFPh using the Case C To Hit DRM for ordnance, or halved FP for MG/IFE if not in Motion; or Case C<span style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: super;">4</span>/quartered FP, if in Motion. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="d332ex.gif" width="319" height="328" alt="d332ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: It is the DFPh of the T34/85 in 1F7. It wishes to fire (using the Infantry Target Type) at the 4-6-7 in J5, so it must change its TCA one hexside from E7-F6 to F6-G7. Having done so, it may now fire at J5 with a +1 DRM for CASE A due to changing a T Type Gun one hexside, a +1 DRM for being BU, and a +3 DRM for terrain (Case Q).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">During its MPh (shown by the blue dots) the T34/85 starts, changes its VCA to F6-G7, and moves to I6—expending a total of five MP before stopping. The 6th MP for stopping is the second MP expended in the LOS of the hidden AT Gun in H3 with a H4-I4 CA. The AT Gun immediately fires at the tank, with a +3 DRM for case J1, before the tank can announce a Bounding First Fire attack on the 4-6-7 in J5. Although the AT Gun hits the tank, it does not penetrate its thick frontal armor. However, it did roll low enough on the colored dr of the To Hit DR to retain a Multiple ROF. The tank must now make an unenviable decision. If it uses Bounding First Fire to fire on the now concealed AT Gun after first expending a MP to change its CA, it must use the +5 DRM of Case C1, plus Case I (BU), Case K (Concealed, <a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">C6.2</a>) and Case Q (TEM), making a hit all but impossible (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.6" class="topiclink">C3.6</a>). Even if the tank were to roll a 1 on the colored dr of its TH DR and retain another shot, its To Hit chances remain negligible especially since it cannot acquire the concealed Gun. Spending an additional (Delay) MP to increase its stay in LOS of the target to 4 MP allows it to use the +4 DRM of Case C, but also allows the AT Gun to improve its next To Hit attempt by switching to Case J (instead of J</span><span class="f_Example" style="font-size: 6pt; vertical-align: super;">1</span><span class="f_Example">) and would allow the AT Gun a potential of two more shots (one per MP expended) against the stopped tank (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.17" class="topiclink">C6.17</a>) if the AT Gun retains its Multiple ROF.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Should the tank start up (7th MP) and change its VCA to J5-J6 (8th MP) in an attempt to move out of LOS (via J6 and K6) it could be fired on through its more vulnerable side Target Facing and/or in J6 (9th MP).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Starting up (7th MP) and moving toward the AT Gun with the intention of an OVR attack has the advantage of preserving the front Target Facing, but increases the penetration capabilities of the AT Gun (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.24" class="topiclink">C7.24</a>) and allows it as many as five (1: start up; 2: change CA; 3: enter 15; 4: enter 14; 5: enter H3) more potential shots (Multiple ROF <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.24" class="topiclink">C2.24</a>; Intensive Fire <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">C5.6</a>; OVR Prevention; <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.64" class="topiclink">C5.64</a>). All of which is a moot point since, even with a maximum ESB chance, the tank lacks the 22 MP necessary [8th MP to change VCA to H5-I5, 9th MP to enter I5, 10th MP to enter I4,18th MP to enter H3 obstacle, and 22nd MP for OVR] to make the OVR (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.1" class="topiclink">7.1</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Failing to do anything and ending its MPh accomplishes nothing because the AT Gun can continue firing at it during the ensuing DFPh as long as it retains its Multiple ROF. The safest solution is to spend its 7th MP to start in reverse, and its 8th-11th to Reverse (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">2.21</a>) back to H6 and out of LOS. The AT Gun may fire at it again in I6 before it leaves the hex because it expended another MP in I6 to start (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.17" class="topiclink">C6.17</a>).</span></p>

If, after firing, another turret-mounted weapon (or the MA which has retained a Multiple ROF) wishes to fire at another target outside the current TCA, the Case A TH DRM would be applicable based only on the move from the current TCA to the new TCA (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.12" class="topiclink">C5.12</a>) but only if the preceding shot(s) were taken at a Known enemy unit; otherwise no further change in TCA is allowed during that phase. These same principles also apply to bow-mounted weapons if changing the VCA to fire.

Any further changes of the TCA incurs normal TCA Case A DRM in addition to the NT Case A DRM of the VCA change <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Bounding First Fire does not pay CA change DRM (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.13" class="topiclink">C5.13</a>) nor does it prevent further changes in TCA/VCA]</span>.

The German wants to fire at all three Known Russian units so he decides not to combine any of his MG factors and to attack each target separately. He starts by using his AAMG vs the 5-2-7 because it pays no DRM for fire outside its CA (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.83" class="topiclink">1.83</a>) and its use has no effect on the tank's other weapons. He decides not to fire his BMG because to do so he must change his VCA and that would require penalizing the first shot of all CA-restricted weapons firing as NT Gun Types rather than T Types (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.11" class="topiclink">C5.11</a>). He now decides to fire his CMG vs the 4-4-7 in Z5 but must pay a +2 DRM due to the two hexspine change in its TCA to Y6-Y5 (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">C5.1</a>). The attack fails to harm the 4-4-7 so the tank fires his MA against the same target—again with a +2 DRM (but this time to the TH DR; <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.51" class="topiclink">3.51</a>). However, the TH DR contains a 1 on the colored dr so the tank maintains its Multiple ROF. The tank could now fire on the 4-4-7 with a -1 Acquisition TH DRM but decides against that and changes its TCA one more hexspine to X4-Y5 where it can fire on the 6-2-8 with a +1 Case A To Hit DRM (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.51" class="topiclink">3.51</a> &amp; <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.12" class="topiclink">C5.12</a>).

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Using the same diagram, assume the tank changes its VCA two hexspines to X4-Y5. As a result, the TCA is now at Y5-Y6. If the BMG fires on Z3—it must do so with a +4 DRM (NT Gun Type; <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.11" class="topiclink">C5.11</a>). If the TCA is also to change to X4-Y5 in order to fire at the same target, it must do so with a +5 DRM (+4 [two hexspine change with NT Gun Type] +1 [further TCA change from Y5-Y6 to X4-Y5 with a T Gun Type]).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Now assume the tank changes its VCA from X6-Y6 to Y5-Y6, but the TCA changes from W6-X6 to W5-W6.

A Gun with a B(#) malfunctions on an Original 12 To-Hit/IFT DR and suffers Low Ammo on any other Original To-Hit/IFT DR ≥ the B(#). A Low Ammo result includes all ammo types the vehicle is allowed to use, as per its Vehicle Listing and the scenario date. A vehicle suffering from Low Ammo is marked with a Low Ammo counter, which changes the original B(#) to an X# (as per <a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.11" class="topiclink">A.11</a>) and creates a new B(#) one less than the Original B(#).</p>

If it rolls an Original TH DR of 12, the MA will malfunction normally. If it rolls an Original TH DR of 11 it is marked with a Low Ammo counter. Thereafter, any Original TH DR of 11 or 12 will Disable the MA, resulting in Recall (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">3.7</a>); any Original TH DR of 10 will malfunction the MA normally—leaving it subject to repair.</span></p>
