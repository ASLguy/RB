Whenever a crew leaves its vehicle it becomes a vehicle-crew counter with a FP of one and often a lower morale. A vehicle-crew counter has all the capability of an infantry-crew counter (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.123" class="topiclink">A1.123</a>), other than its lower Strength Factor, while still retaining its vehicle crew capabilities (<a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.22" class="topiclink">A21.22</a>). All rules dealing with Inherent crews also apply to Temporary crews (<a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.22" class="topiclink">A21.22</a>) unless stated otherwise.</p>

An OT AFV must be CE to use any weapon other than a bow-mounted MG/FT. A CE AFV may enter/exit a building obstacle only if it pays Open Ground costs to do so or is moving entirely within a Factory (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.742" class="topiclink">B23.742</a>) but can become CE once inside a building. However, being CE makes an Inherent AFV crew Vulnerable to Collateral attacks (<a href="chd_chdfootnotes.htm#8" class="topiclink">D.8</a>).</p>
<p><a id="5.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.31 CE DRM:</span> A CE counter represents the Vulnerability of an AFV crew to Collateral Attacks. A CE crew is normally entitled to a +2 DRM due to the partial protection afforded by the AFV but some AFV receive (according to their Vehicle Notes) more protection (or less) depending upon the Target-Facing/Aspect (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.9" class="topiclink">C3.9</a>) through which they are fired on. Non-Fire Lane Residual FP attacks receive the CE DRM that applies to the Side Target Facing. An OT AFV's normal (usually +2) CE DRM can be reduced by Elevation Effects as per <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.61" class="topiclink">6.61</a>, and by Air Bursts (<a href="chb_chb13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">B13.3</a>); see <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.311" class="topiclink">5.311</a>. The CE DRM is not cumulative with any positive TEM.</p>

Consequently the crew is not susceptible to Stun/Recall from such an attack; it is instead subject to PTC/MC/K/KIA results. If it breaks it must rout from the vehicle using normal Infantry rout procedures <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: it expends all its initial-RtPh MF to be placed beneath the vehicle]</span>. The vehicle automatically Stops (no Stop MP is spent) when its crew breaks. If the crew routs or is eliminated, the vehicle is marked with an Abandoned counter. If an OT AFV's crew would receive a CE DRM reduced by Elevation-Effects/Air-Bursts to &lt; its normal CE DRM, that AFV is instead treated as unarmored and the attack vs it—but not vs its PRC—is resolved (with no Air Burst TEM) either as per <a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.308" class="topiclink">A7.308</a> (for non-ordnance/Indirect-Fire-HE) or on the proper TK Table using the pertinent Unarmored Vehicle TK#. <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">C3.71</a> also applies if a HE CH occurred.</p>
