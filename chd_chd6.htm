Passengers may engage in CC although at a disadvantage (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.52" class="topiclink">A11.52</a> &amp; <a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.611" class="topiclink">A11.611</a>). Any vehicle capable of transporting a Passenger has its carrying capacity printed on the counter in the form &quot;#PP&quot;. For Passenger purposes, a squad equals ten PP, a HS/Crew five PP, and ≤ four SMC equal zero PP. Thus a vehicle with Transport Capacity can carry any combination of MMC/SW, provided the transport's PP capacity is not exceeded. See <a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">A5.5</a> for equivalents, and <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a> for PP reduction due to a towed Gun's ammo. Passengers may remain in their vehicle even while broken or may rout beneath a Stopped vehicle per <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.311" class="topiclink">5.311</a>, unless the inherent crew (if any) is eliminated, breaks, or Abandons the vehicle, in which case any broken Passengers must rout beneath the vehicle. Otherwise, a broken Passenger may remain in its vehicle free from rout requirements even if enemy units are ADJACENT, in the same hex, or the vehicle is moving toward an enemy unit (even to OVR). LMG, PLAT, and Thrown DC are the only SW which can be fired by Passengers. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Desperation attacks by SCW/RCL as per <a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.8" class="topiclink">C13.8-.81</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="6.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.2 &nbsp;RIDERS:</span> Riders are Personnel being transported on the outside of an AFV (or Cavalry or motorcyclists). AFV Riders cannot be used until 1942—and even then only by the Russians. In 1943 and thereafter, all nationalities may use Riders. Riders are limited to tanks (not tankettes), TD, SPA, Carriers (limited capacity; <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.81" class="topiclink">6.81</a>), and Assault Guns. Rider capacity is limited to a maximum of 14 PP (as per <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1</a>); in addition a vehicle not otherwise granted Rider capability can carry one SMC as a Rider and the two PP he possesses. See <a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">A5.5</a> for equivalents. Rider PP cannot be used to satisfy the ammo PP reduction (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a>) of any Gun that requires a T# (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>) to be transported; therefore, a dm 76-82mm mortar is transported by Riders at its normal five PP cost.</p>
<p><a id="6.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.21 RESTRICTIONS:</span> Riders are not allowed while the AFV is moving through (not around via Bypass) woods, orchard, buildings <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: friendly Vehicular-Sized Entrance; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.742" class="topiclink">B23.742</a>]</span>, rubble, or Water Obstacles or through Bocage <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Breach; <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.541" class="topiclink">B9.541</a>]</span>, unless it is moving across a road hexside. Should any AFV enter such terrain with Riders, the Riders must Bail Out in the last hex occupied prior to that prohibited terrain. A Rider on a turreted AFV must Bail Out if the AFV changes its TCA.</p>

<p><a id="6.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.22 &nbsp;ATTACKS:</span> Riders may not use SW, must use halved FP as Mounted Fire when firing their inherent FP on the IFT (quartered if the vehicle has moved or is in Motion, inclusive of OVR attacks), and must add one to their CC DR (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.611" class="topiclink">A11.611</a>).</p>
<p><a id="6.23"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.23 TARGET STATUS:</span> Riders are always Vulnerable to fire; i.e., they can never be BU like an AFV crew or halftrack Passenger, nor do they receive any CE benefit. Riders are subject to Collateral Attack. AFV Riders must Bail Out if pinned or broken.</p>
<p><a id="6.24"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.24 BAILING OUT: </span>A Rider (even if already broken) which is forced to leave its AFV (or broken Cavalry [<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.51" class="topiclink">A13.51</a>] or motorcyclists [<a href="chd_chd15.htm#15.53" class="topiclink">15.53</a>]) by combat results (other than the destruction of the AFV) or terrain restrictions (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.21" class="topiclink">6.21</a>) is Bailing Out. Bailing Out never costs the transport any MP but for Defensive First Fire purposes the Rider is considered to spend all remaining (but at least one) MF subject to FFNAM. Any Rider which Bails Out must take a NMC, be placed beneath the AFV in the AFV's current Location, is unable to move or fire further during that phase, and if unbroken is marked with either a Prep Fire or Final Fire counter as appropriate. Any SW carried by a Bailing Out Rider is eliminated if the carrying unit breaks prior to or after Bail Out. Even if the carrying unit does not break as a result of Bailing Out, its SW must be removed from the AFV and checked for malfunction [dr 1-3 = ok; dr 4-6 = malfunction (or elimination if an X# SW)]. Bailing out into an enemy-occupied hex is allowed. See <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">6.5</a> for Bailing Out while in Bypass.</p>

<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">Would that mean that other DFF only occurs vs the rider after his Bailing Out, on the expended MFs (minimum 1 MF) of the Bailing Out, using FFNAM vs the unit which now is Infantry?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Follow-up DFF can occur against either the pre-Bail Out MP or against the post-Bail Out MF; the target would still have it’s post-Bail Out status though in either case.</span></p>

<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">If that MF expense is not considered as part of the resolution of the fire that caused the Bailing Out, could the Bailing Out riders be attacked by the residual fire that caused the Bailing Out?</span></p>

<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">Would such an attack by RF only occur if DRM are less than when the Rider was initially fired at, when still a rider?</span></p>
<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez" style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><span class="f_PerrySez"> Yes, a second attack by RF would require worse DRM basically.</span></p>

<p><a id="6.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.3 TRANSPORT:</span> There is no reduction of a vehicle's MP allotment for transporting Personnel, although it does cost MP to load/disembark them. Units being transported are placed on top of the vehicle; units beneath a vehicle are on foot.</p>
<p><a id="6.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.31 RECOVERY:</span> PRC may not Recover SW not already in their vehicle, although they may transfer SW in their possession to other friendly Infantry/Cavalry in the same Location or other PRC on the same vehicle. Otherwise, SW must be Recovered by Infantry and loaded as the Infantry loads.</p>
<p><a id="6.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.4 LOADING:</span> A vehicle must be stopped to embark Passengers/Riders. It may move in the same MPh after they load, but it may not move in that MPh prior to their loading (including the expenditure of a MP to bring a Motion vehicle to a stop) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Infantry hooking up a Gun, <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">C10.11</a>]</span>. The vehicle retains ¼ of its MP allotment for use in that MPh for each MF remaining to the Infantry that board it. If more than one Infantry unit boards the vehicle, only the unit expending the most MF is counted. It costs one MF to board a vehicle from the same Location. Loading (or unloading) may never occur during the APh. A SW may not be loaded onto or remain aboard an AFV without Passenger/Rider accompaniment <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: any halftrack or Carrier may retain any SW placed in it if those SW apply to that vehicle's Passenger PP capacity]</span>. A vehicle which was not in Motion and loads/unloads Passengers or Riders as its first action in the MPh is not considered a moving target for Case J To Hit purposes, but can be Defensive First Fired upon due to its expenditure of MP. See <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.43" class="topiclink">5.43</a> for attacks vs (un)loading Passengers/Riders. A leader cannot apply his MF bonus to units that load/unload during the same MPh (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.12" class="topiclink">A4.12</a>), but he can add his IPC to one such unit's FPC to increase its movement capability (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.42" class="topiclink">A4.42</a>).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A HS carrying only two PP of SW can enter one Open Ground hex and board a vehicle in that hex which has not moved in the same MPh, leaving the vehicle with half of its MP, but a squad carrying five PP has only two MF and must expend them both to enter that Open Ground hex and load onto the vehicle unless it is accompanied by a SMC (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.12" class="topiclink">A4.12</a>, <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.42" class="topiclink">A4.42</a>) carrying no PP of its own, thereby leaving the vehicle with one-fourth of its MP remaining for that MPh.</span></p>

<p><a id="6.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.5 UNLOADING:</span> A vehicle disembarks Passengers/Riders (without the latter Bailing Out) at a cost of one-fourth (FRU) of its MP allotment <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Infantry unhooking a Gun, <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.12" class="topiclink">C10. 12</a>]</span> per disembarking stack but only while stopped during its own MPh. Disembarking Personnel must expend one MF to be placed beneath the vehicle and are additionally considered to have already expended one MF for every one-fourth of the MP allotment (FRU) used by the vehicle during that turn prior to unloading. Since ESB (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">2.5</a>) does not grant any additional MF, Passengers/Riders may not unload after a vehicle has spent &gt; than ¾ of its printed MP allotment, although they may continue to be transported via any additional MP so obtained. Passengers/Riders may leave a vehicle that fired in the preceding PFPh and expended no MP in this MPh, although they could not leave the vehicle's Location during that MPh. Likewise, they may unload from an immobilized vehicle unless that vehicle has already expended more than three-fourths of its MP allotment during the current MPh.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if an unloading unit has MF remaining (keeping in mind its overall limit of four MF and expenditures of MF during vehicle movement) it may continue to move from that Location with any remaining MF but must do so as part of the same MPh as the conveying vehicle (i.e., it does not have to move together with the stack of units it disembarked with, but no unit other than the conveying vehicle and any other disembarking PRC of that vehicle may move in the interim). Unloading pinned Passengers may not leave the Dismount Location during that MPh. FFNAM always applies vs loading or unloading units (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.6" class="topiclink">A4.6</a>); FFMO applies only if unloading Passengers from an unarmored conveyance in an Open Ground hex or CAFP. PRC may unload or Bail Out in an enemy-occupied hex with no special rules or consequences unless they do so from a vehicle in Bypass (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.151" class="topiclink">A12.151</a>); place a CC counter to show they are not held in Melee. Passengers/Riders of a vehicle in Bypass which unload (even if they do not have enough remaining MF to move into the obstacle) or which during their MPh Abandon/Survive/Bail-Out (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.4" class="topiclink">5.4-.6</a>, <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.24" class="topiclink">6.24</a>) are assumed to be in the terrain of the vehicle's CAFP (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.36" class="topiclink">2.36</a>) for purposes of any Defensive First Fire vs them. Immediately after all such First Fire is resolved, they are assumed to be in the woods or building terrain of the obstacle itself. Unlike AFV, Infantry may not move (on their own) and fire in the same phase. Therefore, Passengers/Riders which fire or add their FP to an OVR during a MPh may not unload in that phase (although they could Bail Out) and vice versa. However, Passengers/Riders on an OVR vehicle which do not add their FP to that OVR may disembark during that MPh. SW carried by a vehicle's Passenger PP capacity can be unloaded/Recovered <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> only by Passengers of the same vehicle.</p>

Similarly, a Passenger leader may direct an OVR or CC attack in which other Passengers take part, but may not be used to direct the halftrack alone.
