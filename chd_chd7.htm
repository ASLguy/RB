<p class="p_Example"><img src="d722ex.gif" width="372" height="200" alt="d722ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The BU tank expends one MP to enter 1E3. The 4-4-7 and 8-1 in D2 then declare a Street Fighting CC Reaction Fire attack (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.211" class="topiclink">7.211</a>) vs it as their Defensive First Fire. The 4-4-7 passes its PAATC, and both units enter E3 where (after surviving all attacks by mines in D2/E3 and Residual-FP/FFE in E3, if any) they make their Reaction Fire CC attack. Their combined CCV is 6, but there is a +2 DRM because the vehicle is Non-Stopped (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.51" class="topiclink">A11.51</a>) and a -2 DRM due to leadership and Ambush, so the AFV will be immobilized on an Original DR of 6, eliminated on an Original DR of 4 or 5, and burned on an Original DR of ≤ 3. However, the DR is ≥ 7 so the attack fails. The 4-4-7 and 8-1, now marked with both a First Fire and a CC counter, return to D2 (again assuming they survive all mine/FFE/Residual-FP attacks as they attempt to do so), and the tank expends another MP to enter D3 where it is safe from Street Fighting since all ADJACENT Russian units are marked with First Fire counters. Next it enters C3 at a cost of 11 MP (7 MP for entering woods, plus an additional 4 MP [¼ of its MP allotment; FRU]) to make an OVR, for a total MP expenditure of 13 thus far in its MPh [Note: the 12.5 MP in the illustration is prior to FRU]. It passes a Bog DR and attacks the 6-2-8 with 20 FP on the IFT (11 [FP] X 3 [TPBF] = 33 ÷ 2 [Bounding First Fire] = 16½ + 4 [MA base] = 20 ½) and a +1 DRM (woods TEM). This attack has no effect vs the 6-2-8, which then passes a PAATC in order to use CC Reaction Fire. Because the 6-2-8 is already marked with a First Fire counter it must reduce its CCV by one due to making a CC Reaction Fire attack as Subsequent First Fire. There is a +2 DRM to its attack (vs a Non-Stopped vehicle), so the tank can be affected only by an Original DR of 2 which will immobilize it or allow the possibility of an Unlikely Kill (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.501" class="topiclink">A11.501</a>). The tank, with one MP remaining, decides to enter B2 and remain in Motion rather than chance CC with the 6-2-8 in the upcoming CCPh. The 6-2-8 is marked with both Final Fire and CC counters.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Now assume the 6-2-8 was under a Final Fire counter when it was OVR. It must now use FPF CC Reaction Fire (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.212" class="topiclink">7.212</a>) even if it fails its PAATC. If it passes the PAATC, its attack will be identical to the Subsequent First Fire CC Reaction Fire attack just described, except that it will be pinned if its Original attack DR is an 8 or broken if that DR is ≥ 9. If it fails the PAATC, it must still attack with the same risk to itself but with its CCV reduced to 3 (5 [CCV] -1 [Pinned] -1 [marked with Final Fire counter] = 3), which, the AFV is still moving (+2 DRM), means its only chance to harm the AFV is with an Original 2 DR, yielding an Unlikely Kill.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the 4-4-7 possessed a SW such as an ATR and fired it when the tank entered E3, that squad could not then use Street Fighting CC Reaction Fire (since the ATR would be marked by a First Fire counter; <a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.211" class="topiclink">7.211</a>). On the other hand, if the 4-4-7 conducted Street Fighting CC Reaction Fire in E3 first, its ATR would still be marked with a First Fire counter.</span></p>
