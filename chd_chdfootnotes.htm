<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1. <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.321" class="topiclink">1.321 RESTRICTED SLOW TRAVERSE (RST):</a></span> An AFV with a Two-Man turret was at a marked tactical disadvantage in combat; the commander's need to divide his attention between directing his crew and serving the Gun resulted in lowered efficiency in both roles. Italian and Russian AFV aggravated this defect by using the commander as the gunner rather than as the loader, with the result that whenever he was unbuttoned to properly direct the AFV or to gain a better view of his situation, the Gun could not be fired at all. This explains much of the relative ineffectiveness of the masses of tanks which the Red Army fielded in 1941. Prior to the war only the Germans and British had grasped the fact that an undistracted commander (as well as a radio) was necessary for the efficient use of a battle tank. The One-Man turrets of French tanks aggravated their situation even more. Most tanks with these drawbacks are represented by having ST and a lower ROF, and thus require no special rules.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.  <a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">1.6 ARMOR FACTOR:</a> </span>The AF represents the average effective armor thickness in cm of that target Facing and aspect, weighted to take Slope into account. A 0 AF actually represents &lt; one cm of armor, while 1 AF represents 1-1.5 cm.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3. <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.401" class="topiclink">2.401 MOTION STATUS:</a></span> The ability to declare Motion status during the opponent's MPh addresses the issue of a fast defender which is forced to sit and watch while a slower but more heavily armed AFV moves next to it before firing. In reality, the lightly armed vehicle would use its speed to move away as soon as an enemy AFV was observed. While this rule does not prevent the ATTACKER from using the turn sequence to artificially cut down the range to such a would-be fleeing target, it does negate some of those advantages by putting the vehicle in Motion, thereby making it not subject to the Point Blank Range To Hit DRM (Case L) and increasing its chances of escape by allowing it to move in its MPh without first expending a MP to start/change VCA.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4. <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">2.5 ESB:</a></span> Tracked vehicles were capable of greater speeds than their MP allotment represents, reflecting a driver's reluctance to punish his vehicle at top speed for fear of mechanical breakdown or throwing a track - especially after long periods in the field without proper maintenance.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5. <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">2.51 MECHANICAL RELIABILITY:</a></span> While most AFV could be expected to function normally within the time span of an average ASL scenario, others were inherently more susceptible to frequent and unexpected mechanical failures usually due to overstressed/poor quality components or an unsound design. Such unreliable AFV should be at some risk of breakdown regardless of the scenario's length or the speed at which they are moving. This phenomenon is obviously exaggerated within the limited time frame of an ASL scenario to compensate for the very presence of such vehicles - this unreliability manifesting itself most often in the failure of such vehicles to even reach the battlefield due to breakdowns en route. A more realistic rule would be to simply make a dr at the start of a scenario which a vehicle with poor mechanical reliability would have to pass in order to be included in the scenario. The drawback to such a system is that play balance can be destroyed before the game even begins.</p>
<p><a id="5a"></a><span class="f_Strong">5A. <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.52" class="topiclink">2.52 AXIS VEHICLES:</a></span> This rule is included because early in the desert campaign these vehicles were not properly modified to cope with the harsh conditions of the desert. Of primary importance were special air and oil filters for engines—the lack of which, in combination with the tremendous clouds of dust raised by moving vehicles and the great distances rapidly traversed, caused engines to overheat/seize-up and led to the premature breakdown of other components.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.  <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">3.5 VEHICULAR MG/IFE FIRE:</a></span> A vehicular MG is not given Multiple ROF capability unless it is listed as the vehicle's MA because of the limited vision and multiple duties of its one-man crew. This is especially true of BMG/CMG armament, which is usually secondary armament and cannot even bring fire to bear without special movement of either the vehicle or the turret (which may well be a hindrance to other tasks of the vehicle with a higher priority). Similarly, although the AAMG of many tanks is often the equivalent of a MMG or HMG in terms of equipment it is still manned by only one man—whose other duties are usually deemed more important (and less dangerous) than the manning of an exposed MG.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.  <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">3.71 LOW AMMO B#:</a></span> Most vehicles with extremely limited ammunition loads were not intended for use in Direct Fire situations such as are most commonly depicted in ASL. Such vehicles are usually a source of OBA, where their ammunition needs are handled by supporting supply trucks. More detailed rules for the use of ammunition vehicles and replenishment of ammunition can be found in <a href="che_che10.htm" class="topiclink">E10</a>.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">8. <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.8" class="topiclink">6.8 CARRIERS:</a></span> The British Army did not have a halftrack as such, aside from the Lend Lease M-5 and its variants. Far more common in Commonwealth service were the Universal, Loyd, and Bren Carriers. These tracked, armored vehicles were mass-produced by a variety of manufacturers in many different armament versions, and were invariably referred to as Carriers. Carrier &quot;crews&quot; were primarily mechanized infantry forming an integral part of the infantry battalions in the British Army. Each battalion HQ Company contained one Carrier platoon of 64 men and 13 Carriers, which functioned as a mobile assault or reserve unit.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.  <a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.11" class="topiclink">7.11 FP:</a></span> Ordnance is given little weight in calculating the FP of an OVR attack because it is of little value in the close-quarter fighting reflected by an OVR. The vehicle depends primarily on its movement, imposing presence, and secondary armament firing on targets of opportunity for its lethality. Most OVR situations would not leave the vehicle with time to bring its MA to bear against targets at such close range and probably in full flight nor might the vehicle commander be willing to stop his vehicle long enough to aim in such close proximity to enemy Infantry without escorting Infantry of his own.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">10. <a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.15" class="topiclink">7.15 OVR TEM:</a></span> The -1 FFMO DRM is applied to the defender in an OVR in Open Ground because it is likely that all but the most seasoned troops will panic and move about when enemy armor is in their midst if they have no cover to hide in. Similarly, the TEM for walls/hedges is applicable if the vehicle crosses that OVR hexside because although the attack is actually resolved in the target hex, it is also taking place as the vehicle approaches the target hex. Such walls/hedges provide excellent cover to hide behind while the vehicle passes by.</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11. <a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">9.3 AFV/WRECK TEM:</a></span> It is not our intention to imply that a wrecked truck is any more of a LOS Hindrance or beneficial cover than an intact one. However, without this rule &quot;brave&quot; players tend to purposely drive trucks in harm's way to screen more valuable units from fire (much to the chagrin of their short-lived cardboard drivers no doubt).</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">12. <a href="chd_chd11.htm#11.11" class="topiclink">11.1 GYROSTABILIZER:</a></span> The Gyrostabilizer was a revolutionary feature found only in certain AFV of U.S. manufacture, commencing with the M3A1 light tank. This device allowed the Gun to maintain its aim in elevation regardless of the terrain traversed. Other tanks of the period required much longer to reacquire a target after movement thus presenting an easier target for return fire. However, many tank commanders disconnected their Stabilizers, preferring to halt before aiming the MA; this was due both to the danger the unpredictably moving breech presented to the turret crew, and to the difficulty in reloading the Gun when both it and the tank were moving. For this reason, players who feel Gyrostabilizers pose too strong an advantage may wish to consider lowering by one the Multiple ROF of all guns so equipped. Allowing every AFV equipped with a Gyrostabilizer the full benefit of a Gyrostabilizer is therefore arguably unrealistic as many crews were not proficient in its use and found it overly complicated and time consuming.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">13. <a href="chd_chd16.htm#16.1" class="topiclink">16.1 DD TANKS:</a></span> Although other tanks pioneered the DD (Duplex Drive) principle, it was the Sherman that used it in action. The vehicle was water-proofed and fitted with a collapsible canvas screen around the hull sides, thus displacing enough water to keep it afloat even though the vehicle itself was suspended below the water's surface. Both propellers and tracks were driven simultaneously, enabling the vehicle to engage the land transport mode instantly upon contact with the shore.</p>
