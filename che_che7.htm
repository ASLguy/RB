However, in any other scenario in which a player has received Air Support by SSR or DYO, he must make a dr during the RPh of each of his Player Turns until he rolls &lt; the current Game Turn Number. Once he does this, his Air Support must be placed onboard in his next MPh.</p>
<p><a id="7.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.21 ENTRY:</span> Upon mapboard entry, another Air Support dr (halved; FRU) must be made to determine the number of aircraft the player receives. This determined, one more dr is made for all aircraft as a group to determine if they are armed with bombs (and in some cases to see if Stukas or Fighter-Bombers {hereafter referred to as FB} are received) by rolling ≤ the exponent of the applicable Air Support Number (see <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.531" class="topiclink">H1.531</a> Table). The aircraft are then placed onboard with the appropriate side face-up. All aircraft received will be of the same type and armament. Aircraft have an unlimited movement capability and may be placed anywhere on the mapboard. As aircraft operate at a level above the topography represented by the board, their movement is not restricted by terrain, enemy units, stacking, or any other factor. However, once an aircraft leaves the mapboard it may not return. Each aircraft remains on the mapboard until eliminated (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.221" class="topiclink">7.221</a>, <a href="che_che7.htm#7.511" class="topiclink">7.511</a>, <a href="che_che7.htm#7.52" class="topiclink">7.52</a>), Recalled (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.24" class="topiclink">7.24</a>), or voluntarily exited during an enemy MPh (unless engaged in Aerial Melee; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.22" class="topiclink">7.22</a>).

To enter Aerial Combat, a player places his FB on top of one or more enemy aircraft during the CCPh and covers them with a CC marker. He may place several of his FB on one enemy aircraft, one FB on several enemy aircraft, or place several of his FB on several enemy aircraft in one or more groups. Each group (or stack) of aircraft beneath a CC/Melee counter is termed a Dogfight. In each CCPh, the ATTACKER'S aircraft in each Dogfight attacks one enemy plane in that Dogfight in sequential CC. All ATTACKER planes resolve their attacks (including any additional attacks allowed by retained ROF; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.222" class="topiclink">7.222</a>) before any surviving DEFENDER plane can return fire. The DEFENDER'S plane cannot attack back if eliminated. If the CCPh ends with planes of both sides still remaining under the same marker, that counter is flipped to its Melee side provided at least one undamaged FB with functioning MG of either side wishes to hold opposing aircraft in Aerial Melee <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Recall; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.224" class="topiclink">7.224</a>]</span>.

A plane can attack only one opposing plane at a time—regardless of the number of enemy planes in that Dogfight. A Final Attack DR ≤ 4 eliminates the target. A Final Attack DR of 5 Damages (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.226" class="topiclink">7.226</a>) the target (mark it with a Wound counter). If a FB rolls an Original Aerial Combat DR of 11 while attacking a Stuka, it is assumed to have been hit by the Stuka's rear gunner. If the colored dr of the Original 11 DR was a 6, it is eliminated; otherwise it is Damaged. Aerial Combat DR are subject to the following cumulative DRM:</p>

Its target may be any plane in its Dogfight. Only FB have an Aerial Combat ROF. An Aerial Combat ROF cannot be used against a ground target.</p>

Such option must be exercised at the end of that CCPh.</p>
<p><a id="7.225"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.225 JETTISON:</span> A plane may jettison its bombs by simply inverting its counter during its own MPh (even if in Melee) to improve its chances in Aerial Combat.</p>

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Two British FB with no bombs are placed on top of three bomb-laden Stukas during the British CCPh. The British player designates that his planes will attack separate targets. The first British plane rolls an Original 7 DR (with 1 on the colored dr), resulting in a Final DR of 5 (7 - 1 [target is not a FB] -1 [target has bombs] = 5) which Damages Stuka &quot;A&quot;. Having retained his ROF, the FB attacks again—choosing to attack the Damaged Stuka &quot;A&quot; again to receive an additional -1 DRM, and rolls an Original 8 for a Final DR of 5 which eliminates Stuka &quot;A&quot;. Having retained his ROF yet again, the FB now attacks Stuka &quot;C&quot; but rolls a 12, thereby disabling its MG and giving Stuka &quot;C&quot; a Recall Option. The British player would like to attack Stuka &quot;C&quot; with his other FB before that Stuka can escape at the end of the CCPh, but is unable to do so now because his initial attack was predesignated against Stuka &quot;B&quot;. He must attack Stuka &quot;B&quot; at least once before switching targets to Stuka &quot;C&quot;. However, his Original Aerial Combat DR is a 9, resulting in no effect and failure to retain his ROF. The German may now return fire with the two surviving Stukas but is subject to a +2 DRM to both attacks, and his Original DR of 4 and 7 fail to have any effect. The CCPh is now over and the CC counter is flipped to the Melee side. The British player, because he is not opposed by FB, may leave Melee but chooses not to. Instead he Recalls only the FB with the Disabled MG. The German chooses not to Recall Stuka &quot;C&quot; and consequently the two German Stukas will be allowed to attack the remaining FB first in their CCPh.</span></p>

An aircraft can be Recalled in three ways: during Aerial Combat (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.223" class="topiclink">7.223-.224</a>), during a Sighting TC (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.31" class="topiclink">7.31</a>), or due to Damage (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.226" class="topiclink">7.226</a>, <a href="che_che7.htm#7.511" class="topiclink">7.511</a>, <a href="che_che7.htm#7.52" class="topiclink">7.52</a>).</p>
<p><a id="7.25"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.25 AERIAL LOS:</span> Given its ability to fly anywhere over the mapboard (and thus to move to the most advantageous viewing position), an aircraft counter is theoretically able to see (provided it passes a Sighting TC; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.3" class="topiclink">7.3</a>) any non-hidden unit that is not completely surrounded by LOS obstacles at least one level higher than its own Location. Before it can attack, an aircraft counter must always move to an attack position (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.4" class="topiclink">7.4-.403</a>)—from which Blind Hexes can still occur. Aircraft cannot cause loss of &quot;?&quot; or prevent the gaining of &quot;?&quot; by &quot;seeing&quot; an enemy unit; aircraft cause &quot;?&quot;-loss only by attacking concealed units and scoring at least a PTC result on the IFT (provided that attacked unit is within the LOS of a Good Order enemy ground unit). However, a unit moving in Open Ground would not be considered concealed to the aircraft, although the aircraft player may not inspect that stack unless it passes the Sighting TC. Should such a Sighting TC reveal only a Dummy unit, the aircraft has the option of whether or not to count that Sighting TC as its only allowed Sighting TC for that turn, but is subject to Light AA fire regardless of his choice. All Aerial units are considered to be at sufficient elevation to reduce the number of Blind Hexes created by any full-level-or-higher LOS Obstacle to one hex, and to reduce any non-cliff Crest Line Blind hexes to zero if there is a ≤ 1 level elevation difference (see <a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.23" class="topiclink">B10.23</a>), <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> and to see INTO any Depression barring other LOS obstacles. To an Aerial viewer, the Blind Hex created by bocage is the hex formed by the bocage hexside. LV Hindrances (Mist; <a href="che_che3.htm#3.32" class="topiclink">3.32</a>) also apply to Aerial LOS, as per the Aerial Range (<a href="che_cheintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">E.5</a>).</p>

The FB is moved to K3 and faced towards K7 to make its Sighting TC along the K3-K4 Hex Grain. Were the truck not present (or if it were out of the plane's LOS at vertex K7-K8-J7 {blue dot}), the FB would have to add a +3 DRM for the building and a -2 DRM for the squad's not being concealed, so it would have to roll ≤ an Original 7 to pass its Sighting TC. However, since the vehicle is in LOS and in the Open Ground portion of the building hex, the -1 DRM for a vehicular Target and the -2 DRM for not being concealed are applicable, so the Sighting TC is passed on an Original DR of ≤ 11. K8 and K10 cannot be attacked because they are Blind Hexes [EXC: K10 could be attacked with a +1 LOS Hindrance DRM if the K9 orchard were out-of-season; <a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.2" class="topiclink">B14.2</a>], but K9 can be attacked without an additional Sighting TC.

An aircraft must always state whether it is making a Strafing or Point Attack just before resolving its second attack. Aircraft attack individually; they may not form a FG, but may attack the same target(s) and leave Residual FP normally. The <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C3 To Hit Table</a> notes the applicability of To Hit DRM to Aerial attacks. Walls/hedges/roadblocks do not provide any TEM to a Ground Support attack. The DEFENDER may add an additional board to any board edge so that his aircraft can set up in its initial attack hex outside the confines of the scenario board configuration. An aircraft cannot attack a Location to which it has no LOS and cannot Interdict.</p>
<p><a id="7.401"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.401 &nbsp;STRAFING:</span> An aircraft strafes by first being placed along a specified Hex Grain so that it is four hexes away from the initial target hex and facing same. After it passes its Sighting TC, and after all Light AA fire (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.51" class="topiclink">7.51</a>) against it has been resolved, it may fire on its initial target. The aircraft then moves to the next hex along the predesignated Hex Grain toward that target and, after receiving all Light AA fire in this hex, may (if it chooses) make another attack DR on a new target hex four hexes distant. The aircraft repeats this procedure (henceforth referred to as a Strafing Run) in every hex traversed until it occupies the target hex of its initial target. At this point it cannot attack again during that Player Turn, but must attempt to continue moving along that Hex Grain to receive all possible Light AA fire until it occupies the last hex it attacked. After receiving all Light AA fire in that last target hex, it is moved to an out-of-the-way corner of the mapboard where it is immune to further Light AA fire until it attacks again in a subsequent Player Turn.</p>
<p><a id="7.402"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.402 POINT ATTACKS: </span>A FB makes a Point Attack in the same manner as a Strafing Run with the following differences. After a FB has made its initial attack from four hexes away and has moved toward that target to the next hex along the predesignated Hex Grain, it may attack the same target hex again. Moreover, because it is now attacking from only three hexes away (six-hex Aerial Range), any To Hit DR is based on the 0-6 column of the To Hit Table instead of the 7-12 column. After this second attack, the FB must still attempt to continue moving along the predesignated Hex Grain until it occupies its target hex for purposes of receiving Light AA fire, but cannot make any additional attacks during that Player Turn.</p>

After its initial MG attack (if any) is resolved, the Stuka is moved to the target hex itself where it may attack again with its MG and drop its bomb load, using the 0-6 column of the To Hit Table. Following its attack, the Stuka must attempt to continue moving along its Hex Grain of Approach for three more hexes for purposes of receiving Light AA fire. A Stuka making a Point Attack, unlike a FB, may attack from its present hex before receiving Light AA fire. A Stuka making a Strafing Run must do so normally; i.e., from four hexes distant, receiving Light AA fire before making each attack. A Stuka cannot bomb during a Strafing Run.</p>
<p><a id="7.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.41 MG ARMAMENT:</span> The IFT FP of FB varies according to the time frame of the scenario. All FB have six FP prior to 1942, eight FP in 1942-43, and 12 FP in 1944-45. This FP can be used against up to four target hexes during each Player Turn in a single Strafing Run and is not subject to Cowering. If attacking a building hex, each level of the building in that hex (including Rooftops if that rule is in play) in LOS is attacked with the same IFT Effects DR as a single attack vs that hex. No To Hit DR is necessary except vs an armored target (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.6" class="topiclink">A9.6</a>), in which case a hit must be secured (with a separate DR and all applicable Aerial Attack DRM; <a href="chc_chc6.htm" class="topiclink">C6</a>) on the 7-12 column if the Aerial Range is eight hexes, or on the 0-6 column if the Aerial Range is ≤ six hexes, using the Vehicle Target Type and the Black To Hit Number. An aircraft's MG Basic To Kill Number is listed under either 39F, 42F, or 44F (depending on the scenario's year) on the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a> (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.31" class="topiclink">C7.31</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: both Stuka types always use the 39F TK#]</span>, and is modified only by the Aerial AF of an AFV (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.12" class="topiclink">C7.12</a>), Aerial Advantage (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.22" class="topiclink">C7.22</a>), and rear Target Facing (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.21" class="topiclink">C7.21</a>). Neither To Kill Case C (CH) nor Case D (Range Effects) apply to Aerial MG attacks. Unlike all other MG To Kill attempts however, an aircraft's MG may attack other unarmored targets in the same hex as the AFV—using the Original To Hit DR vs the AFV as the IFT Effects DR (modified appropriately) vs any unarmored targets (in lieu of any Collateral Attack vs vulnerable PRC). Use the MG—not the Direct Fire—column of the AFV Destruction Table to resolve the attack vs the AFV. A MG attack Original Effects (or To Hit if used as ordnance) DR of 12 results in the permanent breakdown of that weapon. Mark that aircraft with a MG Disabled counter.</p>

<p><a id="7.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.42 BOMBS:</span> Each FB or Stuka can carry one HE bomb load which it fires as an Ordnance weapon on the IFT vs unarmored targets or on the <a href="tables_c7_34heandflametktable.htm" class="topiclink">HE To Kill Table</a> (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.34" class="topiclink">C7.34</a>) vs armored targets. If attacking a building hex, the effect is resolved against all targets in LOS in the building hex with the same IFT Effects DR as a single attack vs that hex. This bombing capacity can be used only once per aircraft. A FB can bomb any target four hexes distant as part of its Strafing Run (or three hexes distant if making the second attack of a Point Attack), but must first score a hit on the 7-12 column (or the 0-6 column if the Aerial Range is ≤ six hexes) of the applicable Infantry/Vehicle Target Type of the <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">To Hit Table</a> (C3), using all DRM applicable to Aerial Attacks (C6) and the Black To Hit Number. If a target hex contains both vehicles and non-vehicular targets, the same To Hit DR is applicable against both Target Types and is resolved against whatever Target Types are hit. The bomb attack can be made with or without an accompanying MG attack but, if made in conjunction with a MG attack, it must be predesignated before resolving that MG attack and resolved after that MG attack. After a bomb attack, the aircraft is flipped over to its reverse side to signify that it no longer has any bombs. Once a bomb To Hit DR is made, that aircraft may not continue to Strafe during that phase; i.e., the bombed hex becomes its final target hex. A bomb To Hit attempt that results in a miss is not resolved vs any target.</p>

If the Final To Hit DR is ≤ half of the Basic TH# (i.e., ≤ 5 unless a FB bombs from an Aerial Range of eight hexes), the result is a Direct Hit and is resolved vs the Aerial AF of the AFV with the HE Basic TK# of the bomb load. If the Final To Hit DR yields a hit, but is not ≤ half of the Basic TH#, the result is a Near Miss and is resolved vs the Aerial AF but with only half of the bomb's Basic TK# and half FP for any Specific Collateral Attack. To Kill Cases A and B (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.21" class="topiclink">C7.21-.22</a>) for Aerial Advantage and rear Target Facing apply in both instances. Any additional AFV in the same Location is unaffected except by the provisions of Overstacking (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.132" class="topiclink">A5.132</a>). Regardless of the type of hit achieved vs an AFV <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Dud]</span>, all unarmored targets in the same Location are also attacked if hit. Each unit hit is attacked with the same IFT or To Kill DR.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A FB making a Point Attack from three hexes away is dropping its bombs on an Open Ground hex containing a moving, BU Pz VIE Tiger tank, a stationary Opel Blitz truck, a squad, and an entrenched HS. The bombs can conceivably affect all four units, depending on the To Hit DR. The Tiger is hit on an Original To Hit DR ≤ 9 (10 [Basic TH# at six-hex Aerial range] +1 [Target Size Modifier] -2 [Moving] = 9) and the track by an Original TH DR ≤ 10. The squad is hit by an Original TH DR &lt; 8, and the HS by an Original TH DR ≤ 6 (+2 TEM). All four targets are hit if the Original TH DR is ≤ 6, and each hit is resolved with the same IFT or To Kill DR.</span></p>
<p><a id="7.422"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.422 AREA TARGET TYPE:</span> An aircraft may make a bomb attack using the Area Target Type instead of the Vehicle/Infantry Target Type, but any hit is resolved with only half the FP of the bomb load. All in-LOS ground units in the target hex are affected if hit, and the effect of the hit vs each unit is resolved on the IFT with a single DR although the applicable TEM of each unit may vary accordingly. AFV are subject to the <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.55" class="topiclink">C1.55</a> Indirect Fire vs AFV IFT DRM.</p>
<p><a id="7.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.43 TARGET STATUS:</span> An attacking aircraft counter does not have to base its Sighting TC on a moving unit. Unlike other units, it may attack both moving/non-moving units during Defensive First Fire with the same attack; any applicable DRM for movement (such as FFMO/FFNAM or the Case J To Hit DRM) are applicable only to those target units that happen to be moving (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.8" class="topiclink">C.8</a>) at the time of the attack. However, a successful Sighting TC vs a moving unit prevents that unit from expending any further MF/MP until that aircraft completes its attacks. An AFV that is the subject of a Sighting TC cannot change its CE/BU status before the initial attack of that successful Sighting TC is resolved (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.33" class="topiclink">D5.33</a>), but can thereafter (within the limits of <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.33" class="topiclink">D5.33</a>)—as can other vehicles in subsequent target hexes of a Strafing Run, provided they do so before their hex becomes eligible for attack. Only one aircraft counter may attempt a Sighting TC before allowing the ATTACKER to expend at least one MF/MP with one of his units. If the ATTACKER declines to expend any MF/MP, the DEFENDER may then elect to attempt another Sighting TC with another aircraft. Each attacking aircraft counter resolves all of its attacks for that Player Turn before the ATTACKER is allowed to expend another MF/MP with any unit, and before another plane is allowed to take a Sighting TC.</p>

An AA-capable weapon's AA mode can also be changed at the end of any fire phase (not MPh) in which that weapon can/does change its CA as per the first sentence of <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.22" class="topiclink">C3.22</a> (even if it is not a Gun). A weapon cannot be marked for Opportunity Fire if in AA mode, but an AA-capable weapon marked for Opportunity Fire can be used vs aircraft by removing the Opportunity Fire counter and placing an AA counter. A weapon in AA mode may be (un)limbered/pushed/hooked up, or dismantled/portaged/loaded/Removed/Scrounged from a vehicle, but doing so causes it to lose its AA counter. An AA-capable weapon may not fire at an Aerial target from a Location that is Blind to that target <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Heavy AA; <a href="che_che7.htm#7.52" class="topiclink">7.52</a>]</span>, nor from inside a building or pillbox.

An attack vs an Aerial target never leaves Residual FP or affects more than one Aerial target.

A MG loses its multiple ROF capability when it fires at an Aerial target and is subject to Cowering, but no leader DRM may apply. A Light AA weapon may not attack the same Aerial target more than once in the same target hex per Player Turn. A vehicle conducting Light AA fire is subject to Bounding First Fire penalties only if it is in Motion or has already expended a MP during that MPh.

Normal Gun Malfunction/ROF rules apply. If more than one aircraft are onboard (including friendly aircraft), the target is determined by Random Selection.

(If Battery Access is not achieved, no Mistaken Attack occurs.) The opponent's control of the plane and its OBA is limited to one Fire Mission vs the non-hidden enemy ground unit that is closest (in hexes) to the original target of the Sighting TC and in the Observation Plane's LOS. If the initial FFE is not accurately placed (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">C1.3</a>), it must be Corrected toward either that unit or the original AR in its next PFPh or DFPh (whichever comes first).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: It is the German MPh in a 1944 scenario. The 4-6-7 enters 4G6, so the American player places his FB in C8, makes a Sighting TC on it, and rolls an Original &quot;11&quot; which, due to the -1 DRM for a moving target and the -2 DRM for an unconcealed target, allows the aircraft to attack that unit - as well as any other in-LOS unit in that hex. However, before the aircraft can attack from C8, the stationary FlaKPz 38(t) in L4, nine hexes away (Aerial Range 18 hexes) and already marked with an AA counter, conducts Light AA fire at it with three FP (halved IFE due to Long Range) on the * Vehicle Line of the IFT. The German unit rolls an Original 4 (1 on the colored dr to maintain its Multiple ROF), but the +3 DRM for the 1944 FB results in a Final DR of 7 and thus no effect. The aircraft makes its attack against G6 with its full 12 MG FP. A -2 DRM (FFMO &amp; FFNAM, due to the squad's movement) applies to the 4-6-7 but not to the non-moving 4-6-8 in the same Location. The aircraft's Original 7 Attack DR is modified to a 5, which yields a 2MC vs the 4-6-7 but remains a 7 DR (and a 1MC) vs the 4-6-8. The aircraft now moves to D7 where it announces that it will continue a Strafing Run vs H5 (if Light AA fire does not destroy it first); any eligible targets in the next three hexes along that Hex Grain can be attacked without need of a new Sighting TC. This time the FlaKPz 38(t) has its full six FP because the target is now within eight hexes (16 hexes Aerial Range), but its attack's Original 10 DR causes loss of its Multiple ROF and has no effect vs the aircraft . The plane now attacks H5 with 12 FP and an Original 5 DR which, modified to a 6 by the woods TEM, causes a 2MC vs the 2-4-7. The aircraft then moves to E7 where it comes under Light AA fire from the HMG in K2 on the 6 FP column. The HMG could have fired on the aircraft earlier in C8 or D7 but chose not to because its FP would have been halved for Long Range Fire. The HMG is marked for Opportunity Fire but that counter must be removed to place the AA counter so it can use Light AA fire. The HMG's ROF is reduced to 0 for firing at an Aerial Target, and it rolls an Original 3 DR for a Final DR of 6, which Damages the aircraft . The aircraft must continue along the present Hex Grain until it reaches H5—its last target hex. 15 cannot be attacked anyway because it is a Blind Hex. The aircraft now moves to F6 where, had the aircraft not been Damaged, it could normally attempt its last attack—but J4 is also a Blind Hex due to the woods in 15 and therefore cannot be attacked. Although the aircraft's attack options are over, it must continue to move along the Hex Grain, accepting Light AA fire from eligible units, until it leaves H5. The HMG that Damaged the aircraft cannot be used against air or ground targets for the remainder of the current Player Turn. Because the aircraft is attacking during its DFPh, the ground units that are &quot;Defensive First Firing&quot; at it are actually firing during their MPh. If the FlaKPz 38(t) had been moving (as defined in C.8) its FP would have been halved as Bounding First Fire (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.51" class="topiclink">7.51</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A Non-Stopped (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.8" class="topiclink">C.8</a>) FlaKPz IV/20 Whirlwind is in AA mode when it is attacked by a strafing FB. Its Light AA FP vs the FB is quartered due to both Bounding First Fire (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.31" class="topiclink">D3.31</a>) and Non-Stopped fire (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.42" class="topiclink">D2.42</a>), but its ROF remains 2 (IFE ROF is always reduced by one; <a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.29" class="topiclink">C2.29</a>). Only after the FB completes its Strafing Run can the Whirlwind expend another MP to stop and, if it has retained its ROF, it can then fire on any other attacking aircraft in range and LOS with halved FP as Bounding First Fire. However, if it decides to fire on a ground target with IFE, it will have to removes its AA counter—thus reducing its ROF to 1 for its next shot.</span></p>

<p class="p_PerrySez"><span class="f_PerrySez">In relation to the same subject I have a further question about observation planes and mistaken attack <a href="che_che7.htm#7.62" class="topiclink">E7.62</a>. When this occurs does the opposing player place an AR on the nearest enemy unit closest in hexes to the original target of the STC, and then roll for accuracy for the mistaken attack FFE? If the initial FFE is not accurately placed is it possible for it to drift back to the units owned by the player directing the mistaken attack and attack them? For example; say the German in RB is using an observation plane and a mistaken attack opportunity arises. Does the Russian then place an AR on the nearest German units and roll for accuracy for the mistaken attack FFE? If the FFE is not accurate can it drift back to the Russians own units and attack those?</span></p>
