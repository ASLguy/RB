<p><a id="10.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.1</span> &nbsp;A Hillside wall/hedge is one which lies along a hexside that is common to two adjacent hexes with different Base Levels, with none of the lower Base-Level's terrain appearing between the wall/hedge depiction and the higher Base-Level's terrain depiction. Examples of Hillside walls/hedges are 25B4-B5, &nbsp;25C5-C6, &nbsp;25U3-U4, &nbsp;25V9-W9, &nbsp;25X4-X5, &nbsp; 8M4-M5, 8X3-X4, 12X4-Y4, and 13S4-S5. All normal wall/hedge rules apply to Hillside walls/hedges except as modified herein.</p>
<p><a id="10.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.2 &nbsp;LOS: </span>A Hillside wall/hedge (including both its depiction and its associated hexside; <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.1" class="topiclink">B9.1</a>) is ignored when determining whether or not a LOS exists between units whose elevations differ by ≥ one full level <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a unit entrenched behind a Hillside wall/hedge still has its LOS restricted as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>]</span>. It is likewise ignored when determining the number of Blind Hexes created by a Crest Line. If a hill Crest Line ends at a Hillside wall/hedge, the line along which the hill depiction meets the wall/hedge depiction is considered to be the actual Crest Line. </p>
<p><img src="f102ex.gif" width="298" height="304" alt="f102ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The 4-6-7 in 25W4, the 4-3-6 in W5, and the Crest-status 4-6-8 in V5 all have a LOS across one or more wall hexsides/hexspines to the following hill hexes: U7, V6, V7, W6, W7, W8, X5, X6 and X7 (although they could see entrenched units in V6/W6/X5 only if adjacent to them). A unit IN V5 would have a LOS to all those same hexes [EXC: not to any entrenched unit(s) in X5J. The 4-6-7 also has a LOS to the Crest level of Y7. The 4-3-6 also has a LOS to Y5. In no case could any of these units claim wall TEM vs an attack coming from any of these in-LOS hill hexes.</span></p>
<p><a id="10.3"></a><img src="walladvan.gif" width="57" height="58" alt="WALLADVAN" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10.3 ELEVATION, TEM &amp; WALL ADVANTAGE:</span> A Hillside wall/hedge is always at the higher of the two Base Levels it lies between, and is treated as a normal wall/hedge when calculating the TEM of targets at ≥ the wall/hedge's base elevation. However, a unit at any level lower than that on which a Hillside wall/hedge sits never receives any benefit (including Wall Advantage; <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.32" class="topiclink">B9.32</a>) from that wall/hedge hexside. A unit in Crest status may claim Wall Advantage over a Hillside wall/hedge that forms a hexside of that unit's hex only if both are at the same elevation and on the same side of the Depression. Otherwise, a unit's inability to claim Wall Advantage over a Hillside wall/hedge hexside does not prevent it from claiming Wall Advantage over another wall/hedge hexside, provided the unit meets all the other B9 criteria for doing so.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="f103ex.gif" width="307" height="194" alt="f103ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The 4-6-7 IN 25B4 can claim neither hedge TEM vs, nor Wall Advantage over, the 4-5-8 in B5, nor can it claim hedge TEM vs the 4-5-7 in C6; however, the 4-5-8 could receive such benefits, and the 4-5-7 could claim hedge TEM, vs the 4-6-7 because both British squads are directly behind, and at the same level as, a Hillside hedge (hexside C5-C6 in the case of the 4-5-7). (If the 4-6-7 were in Crest status with its center protected Crest hexside at B4-A5 or B4-B5, then it could, if having Wall Advantage, claim hedge TEM vs the 4-5-8/4-5-7 since it would be at the same level as, and directly behind, the hedge. If it claimed Wall Advantage it could not also claim entrenchment TEM vs the 4-5-8 [<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.31" class="topiclink">B9.31</a>], but if it did not claim Wall Advantage while in Crest status, the 4-5-7's attack vs it would still be affected by the B4-B5 hedge TEM [<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">B9.3</a>]. Regardless of whether or not the Crest 4-6-7 claimed Wall Advantage, the 4-5-7 's attack vs it would not be affected by entrenchment TEM [<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.92" class="topiclink">B20.92</a>].)</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Neither the 4-6-8 IN C5 nor the Crest-status 4-4-7 in C5 can claim hedge TEM vs, or Wall Advantage over, the 4-5-7 because both German squads are lower than the C5-C6 hedge's base elevation. If the hero in B6 attacks the C5 Germans, the 4-4-7 (but not the 4-6-8) can claim the B5-C5 hedge TEM (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">B9.3</a>). (The C5-C6 level-one hedge cannot affect that attack by the hero.)</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Provided neither the 4-5-8 nor the 4-5-7 were already marked with a Wall Advantage counter, the 4-4-7 could claim Wall Advantage over the B5-C5 hedge even though it cannot claim it over the higher-level C5-C6 hedge.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the 4-5-8 fires at the Crest-status 5-4-8 in D5, the latter cannot claim hedge TEM since it is a level lower than hexsides C5-C6 and D5-C6.</span></p>
