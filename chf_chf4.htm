<p><a id="4.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.1</span> &nbsp;A deir<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chf_chffootnotes.htm#7" class="topiclink">7</a></span> is a terrain feature of any overlay (<a href="chf_chf12.htm" class="topiclink">12.</a>) whose ID is prefixed by a &quot;D&quot;, and is represented by a yellowish area enclosed by golden yellow shading (this shading being known as the Lip).</p>
<p><a id="4.2"></a>4.2 &nbsp;A deir, including its Lip hexes (i.e., those hexes on the overlay that contain a Lip), is a slight concavity. Units in a deir are at level 0 (assuming the overlay is on level 0 terrain), but can receive certain protective benefits due to the deir's Lip. Each hexside that forms part of a Lip hex, while lying completely &quot;outside&quot; the Lip, is termed a Lip Hexside. All deir hexes are Open Ground (<a href="chf_chf1.htm#1.1" class="topiclink">1.1</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if deir TEM applies; <a href="chf_chf4.htm#4.5" class="topiclink">4.5</a>]</span> except as altered by the presence of scrub (<a href="chf_chf2.htm#2.2" class="topiclink">2.2</a>) or sand (<a href="chf_chf7.htm#7.2" class="topiclink">7.2</a>).</p>
<p><a id="4.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.3 &nbsp;MF/MP:</span> A unit (regardless of type) pays no extra MF/MP cost for entering/traversing a deir Location other than the COT of the hex (which is usually Open Ground). <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: A vehicle that exits a deir hex via a Lip Hexside must expend one extra MP to cross that hexside. For Defensive Fire purposes, this MP is assumed to be expended in the hex entered.]</span></p>
<p><a id="4.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.4 &nbsp;LOS:</span> A deir's only effect on LOS is that, barring other LOS obstructions, an entrenched/Emplaced unit in a non-Lip deir hex has a LOS past a Lip Hexside only to a same-level hex formed by that Lip hexside, and to any hex at a higher elevation than that entrenched/Emplaced unit. See also <a href="chf_chf4.htm#4.51" class="topiclink">4.51</a>.</p>
<p><a id="4.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.5 &nbsp;TEM:</span> A non-PRC target in a deir receives a +1 TEM (or may claim HD status) vs Direct Fire if the firer is at the same elevation as the target and that firer's LOF crosses a Lip Hexside that does not form part of that firer's hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if the firer and target are in separate deirs, and the firer is ADJACENT to the target across a Lip Hexside, that target still receives the deir's protective benefit]</span>. Otherwise, a deir gives no protective benefit and is treated as flat level ground <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Fire Lane; <a href="chf_chf4.htm#4.52" class="topiclink">4.52</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="4.51"></a><img src="wreck.gif" width="71" height="71" alt="WRECK" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4.51 AFV/WRECK TEM &amp; HINDRANCE:</span> An AFV/wreck in a deir can provide a +1 TEM in the normal manner. Likewise, a LOS Hindrance in a deir can affect LOS in the normal manner <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a &quot;half-level&quot; Hindrance in a deir can affect LOS only if both the viewing and viewed units are at the same level and at least one of those units is in any deir; for deir LOS purposes, brush, bridge, grain, marsh, crag, and an AFV/wreck (in LOS as per <a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">D9.4</a>) are defined as &quot;half-level&quot; Hindrances]</span>. </p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="f451ex.gif" width="593" height="331" alt="f451ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: Shown in the illustration are a deir (with its Lip Hexsides shown by the dashed line) and a hillock (<a href="chf_chf6.htm" class="topiclink">6.</a>). Below are listed the LOS and protective benefits of the various units shown. Note that all units in the illustration are in mutual LOS unless specifically mentioned otherwise. Similarly, +1 TEM/HD status (which cannot apply to mortar/OBA fire) is given only where applicable; units not mentioned are not eligible for such status. Not all AFV LOS Hindrances are listed, but a representative sample is given.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Tank A is HD only to tanks B and C and squads H, I and M. Tank A Hinders squad E's LOS to tanks B and C and to squads L and M, but not to hexes P7-P9 or R9-S10.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Tank B is HD only to tank A and squads H and I. Tank B Hinders Tank C's LOS to all other units shown except for squads F, G and L.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Tank C is HD only to tank A and squads E, H and I. Tank C Hinders tank D's and tank B's (but not squad F's) LOS to hex P9, and also Hinders tank B's and tank A's (but not squad E's) LOS to hex R9.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Tank D is HD only to squads H and I. Tank D Hinders squad H's LOS to squads K and L, but does not Hinder squad G's LOS at all. Tank D Hinders squad F's LOS to tank A but not to squad E.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Only entrenched squad J lacks a LOS to squads H and I.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Squad K receives a +1 deir TEM (vs Direct Fire) only if fired on by squad(s) H/I (<a href="chf_chf4.htm#4.5" class="topiclink">4.5</a>), and a +1 Hindrance DRM vs their fire due to tank D.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;Squad M receives a +1 TEM due to tank C if fired on by any unit (considering them to be British for the moment) other than tank C (<a href="chf_chf4.htm#4.51" class="topiclink">4.51</a>; but this TEM is not cumulative with any deir TEM). If tank C were not in the hex, squad M would still receive a +1 deir TEM vs Direct Fire from squads H/I or E as well as from tank A (were it British).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">• &nbsp;The FP of a Fire Lane counter placed in S10 by squad E would not affect moving squads K, J or L, nor would it affect any Vulnerable PRC of moving tanks B or A. However, if squad E placed the Fire Lane counter in R8, moving squad L could be attacked by it, as could the Vulnerable PRC of moving tanks A and B. Only in the latter placement of the Fire Lane counter could tanks A and B possibly Hinder the Fire Lane.</span></p>
<p><a id="4.52"></a><img src="firelane2.gif" width="61" height="62" alt="FIRELANE2" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4.52 FIRE LANE:</span> Infantry/Horses moving in a deir hex are immune to a Fire Lane attack in that hex if that Fire Lane crosses a Lip Hexside before/as it enters that hex and that hex does not contain the Fire Lane counter. A vehicle/Vulnerable-PRC <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Cavalry Personnel]</span> moving in a deir hex is immune to a Fire Lane attack in that hex if a Wreck in that hex would not Hinder that LOF (see <a href="chf_chf4.htm#4.51" class="topiclink">4.51</a>) and that hex does not contain the Fire Lane counter.</p>
