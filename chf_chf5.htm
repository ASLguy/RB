In addition, each group of contiguous hexes on board 25 (and on Overlay E1) which contains this same type of artwork is a wadi; e.g., 25D7, E8, E9, E10 and F10 are wadi hexes and together constitute a wadi—as is also true of hexes I5 and J5 on Overlay E1.

Note that many of the wadis printed on board 25 (and on Overlay E1) change elevation along their length, and some wadi hexes also contain a Hill Crest line that is not crossed by the wadi. Movement in such Hill Depression hexes (<a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.5" class="topiclink">B19.5</a>) requires frequent use of the rules for Abrupt Elevation Changes (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">B10.5-.51</a>) and Double Crests (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.52" class="topiclink">B10.52</a>), and the special LOS considerations given in <a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.5" class="topiclink">B19.5-.52</a>.</p>

When a unit entering a Hill Depression hex crosses a higher Crest Line but not a Depression hexside, it always pays the appropriate cost of moving to a higher elevation (due to making an Abrupt Elevation Change).</p>

A Depression Cliff on the same side of a wadi as a normal cliff hexside represents a continuous cliff from the bottom of that Depression to the top of that cliff.</p>

No type of unit may gain Crest status along a Depression Cliff (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.9" class="topiclink">B20.9</a>), although the presence of a normal cliff or an Abrupt Elevation Change as a hexside of a wadi hex does not itself prevent Crest status along that hexside.</p>

Infantry may Place a DC vs a Crest vehicle by expending the MF required for it to enter that Crest position and making a Position DR (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.346" class="topiclink">C7.346</a>), but no unit may Throw a DC at such a vehicle.</p>

To gain Crest status from WITHIN the wadi it must expend five MP (actually 4+0 MP for moving forward to a higher elevation but not entering another hex, plus one MP to Stop)—or alternatively it can Reverse into Crest status by expending four times its Reverse multiplier, plus one MP to stop. A vehicle may also enter a wadi hex via a non-wadi, non-wadi-cliff hexside to directly gain Crest status without going INTO the wadi, and may do so using either forward or Reverse movement. The MP cost using this method is the COT of the wadi hex (usually one MP for Open Ground—times that vehicle's Reverse multiplier [<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">D2.21</a>] if using Reverse movement) plus any cost for SMOKE, Dust (<a href="chf_chf11.htm#11.7" class="topiclink">11.7</a>), etc. in the wadi hex. A vehicle in Crest status is covered by a Vehicle Crest counter, which is placed with the words &quot;HD (rear)&quot; face-up if the vehicle directly gained Crest status by using forward movement across a non-wadi hexside without going INTO that wadi hex, or if it Reversed into Crest status from WITHIN that hex. A vehicle in Crest status may never change its VCA, but may change its TCA in the normal manner. A vehicle may gain Crest status by making a Minimum Move (even using Reverse Movement— i.e., making a Reverse Minimum Move), but only if that move begins IN the wadi hex in which the Crest status is gained, and once in Crest status the vehicle is assumed to immediately expend a Stop MP. A maneuver to/from Crest status is most easily visualized by imagining a Crest vehicle to be at the vertex that the Crest-side &quot;tip&quot; of its counter touches (hereafter referred to as its &quot;Crest CAFP&quot;). Note however, that for LOS purposes (<a href="chf_chf5.htm#5.424" class="topiclink">5.424</a>) the vehicle is not considered to be at the Crest CAFP. See also <a href="chf_chf5.htm#5.421" class="topiclink">5.421</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="f542ex.gif" width="225" height="197" alt="f542ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The non-stopped tank IN 25D2 wishes to gain Crest status in C2 with its VCA at D2-C3. Its total MP cost to do so is ten MP (3 [enter wadi] + 2 [change VCA to D2-C3]+4 [enter Crest status] +1 [Stop] = 10). The Crest-status tank may be visualized as being &quot;at&quot; vertex C2-D2-C3, which is its Crest CAFP. Alternatively, it could achieve this same Crest CAFP by Reversing from WITHIN C2, but this would require 23 MP (3 [enter wadi] + l [change VCA to B1-C1J+2 [Stop and Start]+ 16 {4 [enter Crest status] X4 [Reverse]}+1 [Stop] =23), thus requiring two MPh to accomplish. The tank would then be marked with the &quot;HD (rear)&quot; side of a Vehicle Crest counter since it Reversed into Crest status from WITHIN that wadi hex.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The non-stopped tank in 25C3 wishes to gain Crest status during this MPh in C2 with its Crest CAFP at C2-D2-C3. It has three choices: it can move INTO the C2 wadi (3 MP), change VCA to D2-C3 (2 MP), enter Crest status (4 MP), and stop (1 MP), for a total expenditure of ten MP; or while still in C3 it can change its VCA to D3-C4 (2 MP), stop and start again (2 MP), then Reverse into Crest position in C2 (4 MP; 1 [Open Ground COT] X4 [Reverse] =4) and stop (1 MP), for a total expenditure of nine MP; or while still in C3 it can change its VCA to B2-C2 (1 MP), move directly into Crest status in C2 (1 MP) and stop (1 MP), for a total expenditure of three MP. In this last case it would then be marked with the &quot;HD (rear)&quot; side of a Vehicle Crest counter since it directly gained Crest status by using forward movement across a non-wadi hexside without going INTO that wadi hex.</span></p>

A Crest-status Gun and its manning Infantry use a ⅝&quot; Crest counter in the manner prescribed for Infantry; both receive the normal Crest Infantry entrenchment DRM, but only vs Direct Fire attacks that lack a LOS INTO the wadi and cross a protected Crest hex-side in the normal manner. Such a crew may claim a Gunshield DRM in the normal manner. A Gun may be towed into/out-of Crest position; it may also be Pushed directly into, or out of, Crest status (i.e., either INTO the wadi, or into an adjacent hex) using normal Infantry Crest movement and Manhandling rules. A Gun may not set up Emplaced in Crest status (<a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.1a" class="topiclink">F.1A</a>). A Gun may change its CA while in Crest status <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a NT Gun must keep at least one protected Crest hexside within its CA]</span>, and is not penalized by Area Fire for firing outside of its protected Crest front (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.94" class="topiclink">B20.94</a>). See <a href="chf_chf5.htm#5.426" class="topiclink">5.426</a> for for the restrictions on what levels the Gun may fire to.</p>
