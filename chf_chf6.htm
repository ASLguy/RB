A Hillock Summit is treated as a normal hillock that rises from Level ½ instead of from Level 0. Therefore, a unit on, above or behind a Hillock Summit can see to/from/past Hillock Summits using <a href="chf_chf6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">6.4-.44</a>, treating the Summits as higher-level hillocks.

A Fire Lane counter placed in hex oR9 by squad F would attack moving units in oR4, oR8 and oR9, and might be affected by any Hindrance(s) therein—but in hexes R5-R7 could affect only moving Cavalry Personnel (not their horses), and could not be affected by any &quot;half-level&quot; Hindrances in in those hexes.
