<p><a id="8.1"></a><img src="f81.gif" width="145" height="74" alt="f81" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8.1</span> A sangar<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chf_chffootnotes.htm#15" class="topiclink">15</a></span> is treated exactly like a foxhole except as modified herein.</p>
<p><a id="8.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.2 &nbsp;PLACEMENT:</span> A sangar cannot be created during play, nor may it be set up in sand (<a href="chf_chf7.htm#7.42" class="topiclink">7.42</a>). No more than one sangar may be placed per hex. A sangar has a BPV of ½.</p>
<p><a id="8.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.3 &nbsp;CAPACITY:</span> A sangar has the same capacity as a 1S foxhole. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: One non-vehicular Gun of any size/type may be placed in, and may fire out of, a sangar. A sangar that contains a Gun may never also contain a squad, nor more MMC than one HS or crew. A sangar's capacity is the total number of units/Guns allowed beneath it, rather than a &quot;per side&quot; capacity as given in <a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.44" class="topiclink">B27.44</a>.]</span> A Good Order Infantry squad (of any type/ nationality) which wishes to man a sangared Gun (i.e., one beneath a Sangar counter) must Deploy (allowed automatically, regardless of leader/nationality requirements) while in/ADJACENT-to the sangar Location, but only immediately prior to entering (or at least attempting to enter) beneath the sangar in the same phase. The capacity of a sangar may not be increased.</p>
<p><a id="8.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.4 &nbsp;TEM:</span> A sangared unit receives a +3 TEM vs OBA (and Bombardment), and a +1 TEM vs other attacks <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: CC, FT]</span>. Only a crew manning a sangared Emplaced Gun may claim the +2 Emplacement TEM in lieu of the +1 sangar TEM.</p>
<p><a id="8.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.41</span> A Final KIA (prior to applying any Gunshield DRM) vs a sangar/its-occupants results in elimination of the Sangar counter if caused by a DC, by an OVR, by an ordnance/OBA attack of HE ≥ 70mm, or by any HE CH. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC to all: AP HE Equivalency cannot cause such elimination.]</span> OVR of a sangar by a full-tracked AFV causes the automatic elimination of the sangar and any Gun in it, provided the AFV was still Mobile (<a href="chd_chdintro.htm#.7" class="topiclink">D.7</a>) when its OVR was resolved. All surviving pieces are thereafter left devoid of sangar benefits.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A squad and leader in a sangar are attacked by OBA. If a KIA occurs after applying the + 3 sangar TEM, the sangar is eliminated regardless of which unit was KIA'd. If the OBA had achieved a CH, the unit thusly affected would receive a -3 TEM and the other a +3 TEM, but the sangar would still be eliminated.</span></p>
<p><a id="8.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.5 MOVEMENT: </span>A vehicle may enter/traverse a hex that contains a sangar at no extra movement cost for the sangar's presence <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if a trench is Accessible to that sangar as per <a href="chf_chf8.htm#8.6" class="topiclink">8.6</a>, the sangar hex's COT is doubled]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="8.51"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.51 UNDERBELLY HITS:</span> A full-tracked AFV OVRing a sangar is vulnerable to Underbelly Hits (even from within that sangar) as per <a href="chd_chd4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">D4.3</a>. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: The AFV is considered to be in the sangar's Location, but the LOS for an Underbelly Hit attempt is drawn to a vertex of the hexside the AFV is crossing; if the AFV becomes Immobile or destroyed, it is left in the sangar's Location.]</span> Vulnerability to Underbelly Hits no longer applies after the OVR is resolved.</p>
<p><a id="8.52"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.52 &nbsp;GUN:</span> Provided it does not exceed sangar stacking capacity (<a href="chf_chf8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">8.3</a>), a Gun may enter a sangar during play—but only by being successfully Pushed (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">C10.3</a>) into it from the sangar's Location, using its +1 TEM and one-MF (doubled to two for Pushing) entry cost. Hence a Gun must be Pushed out of a sangar before it can be loaded-on/hooked-up-to a vehicle. Any additional MMC wishing to help Push it may do so despite not being in the sangar.</p>
<p><a id="8.6"></a><img src="f86.gif" width="76" height="77" alt="f86" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8.6 TRENCH:</span> Infantry beneath a Trench or Sangar counter may move/rout/advance/Withdraw-from-CC directly to any Accessible, non-Crest-status lower-elevation Location without having to first exit to above that trench/sangar.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chf_chffootnotes.htm#16" class="topiclink">16</a></span> Such a move/rout/advance/CC-Withdrawal in the opposite direction, from a non-Crest-status position to beneath an Accessible higher-elevation trench/sangar, is also allowed if that Infantry unit and trench/sangar are in the same side's OB and/or the unit's side Controls the trench/sangar. In addition, if a Trench counter and Sangar counter are Accessible to each other, Infantry may move/rout/advance/Withdraw-from-CC from beneath one to beneath the other as if both were trenches (in the same manner as a Bunker; see <a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.8" class="topiclink">B30.8</a>) regardless of which side set-up/Controls the one being entered. A Snap Shot taken at a unit that is utilizing the movement benefits of such a trench/sangar/bunker is subject to Trench TEM. If a sangar already contains its maximum stacking capacity, a unit wishing to enter that sangar hex must first exit to above any trench it may currently be in and may not utilize trench/sangar movement/TEM benefits to enter that hex. This rule (8.6) does not apply to Infantry Pushing a Gun. </p>
<p><img src="f86ex.gif" width="293" height="182" alt="f86ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: An entrenched Infantry unit in M3 can, if not Pushing a Gun, move/rout/advance/Withdraw-from-CC directly to beneath either sangar at a cost of one MF without losing the protective benefits of the Trench/Sangar counter(s), or it can thusly enter any lower-level Location adjacent to M3 without first having to exit above the trench. If the unit is sangared in L2 it can enter M3 (two MF), L1 (one MF) or K2 (one MF) without first having to exit above the sangar (though it could be subject to FFMO/Interdiction in K2); however, it would have to exit above the sangar before it could enter K3, L3 or M2 (and once in M2 would have to expend another MF to enter beneath that sangar). If the unit is sangared in M2 it can enter L1 or M3 in the same manner as entering them from L2, or it can enter M1 at a cost of two MF without first having to exit above the sangar; it must, however, exit above the sangar before it can enter N1, N2 or L2. An Infantry unit in K2 which wishes to move/advance, etc. beneath the sangar in L2 can, if that unit's side had set up and/or presently Controls that sangar, expend two MF and enter L2 going directly beneath the sangar; and the same would hold true for Infantry in M1, or non-entrenched Infantry in L1, wishing to enter the M2 sangar—but Infantry entrenched in L1 could enter the L2/M2 sangar regardless of which side set-up/Controls that sangar. If the L2/M2 sangar already contains a squad, an Infantry unit wishing to enter beneath it must first exit above the trench it might be in, cannot claim Trench movement/TEM as it enters the sangar hex, and once in the sangar hex cannot go beneath the sangar. An Infantry unit entrenched in M3 can enter INTO N3 (three MF) without first having to exit above the trench (and could be subject to FFMO/Interdiction IN N3), but would first have to exit above the trench if it wished to directly enter Crest status in N3 without first going INTO it; conversely, only from IN N3 can the unit enter M3 (four MF) going directly beneath the trench—and even then only provided that unit's side had set up and/or presently Controls that sangar. The preceding sentence would still apply if M3 were a level 1 hex (though the MF costs would then differ).</span></p>
