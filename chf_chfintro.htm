In a non-night scenario which uses only Desert Board(s) that are not Broken/Steppe Terrain (<a href="chf_chf13.htm#13.1" class="topiclink">13.1-.2</a>), a unit can be eliminated for Failure to Rout (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">A10.5</a>) only if the enemy unit(s) forcing it to rout is within six hexes of it.</p>

A hex comprising a Desert half-hex and a non-Desert half-hex is considered Desert Terrain only if it is also a Wadi (<a href="chf_chf5.htm" class="topiclink">5.</a>) hex and/or is Accessible to Hammada-(<a href="chf_chf3.htm" class="topiclink">3.</a>)/Sand-(<a href="chf_chf7.htm" class="topiclink">7.</a>).</p>
<p><img src="f02.gif" width="299" height="268" alt="F02" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The PSW 222(L) begins its MPh by expending three MP to enter D4 (Chapter B orchard MP cost), then enters C4 at a cost of one MP (Desert [i.e., Chapter F] Open Ground), then enters B4 at a cost of five MP (4 [enter wadi] + 1 [Desert Open Ground] = 5). It cannot enter A4, which is a woods hex as well as a wadi hex (<a href="chf_chf5.htm#5.12" class="topiclink">F5.12</a>, <a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.21" class="topiclink">B19.21</a>, <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.4" class="topiclink">A2.4</a>), because an AC must expend all of its MP allotment to enter woods (Chapter B Terrain Chart). So it exits the wadi by entering A5 at a cost of seven MP (4 [ascend a level] + 3 [Chapter B Open Ground] = 7), and expends two MP to change its VCA two hexspines counterclockwise. Next it uses VBM along hexside B5-A6 at a cost of two MP (Desert Open Ground x 2) and enters B6 at a cost of seven MP (4 [ascend a level] + 3 [enter orchard] = 7). It then expends one MP to change its VCA one hexspine clockwise, and uses VBM along hexside A7-B7 at a cost of six MP (Chapter B Open Ground x 2). At this point it must again end its MPh in Motion. The PzKpfw IIIL now begins its MPh by expending a MP to Start, and enters B4 at a cost of three MP (2 [enter wadi] + 1 [Desert Open Ground] = 3). Next it enters A4 at a cost of 8½ MP (2 [enter wadi] + 6½ [Desert COT, which in this case is half its MP allotment due to entering woods] = 8½). With only ½ MP remaining, the tank must now end its MPh in Motion unless it opts to risk ESB. For simplicity's sake, all Bog/Immobilization DR have been ignored in this example.</span></p>
<p><a id=".2a"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.2A BOARD 25 HILL:</span> When entering a board 25 hill hex that contains neither scrub, hammada nor a wadi, the Chapter B Terrain Chart is used to determine the applicable MF/MP costs <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Hammada Immobilization (<a href="chf_chf3.htm#3.31" class="topiclink">3.31</a>) and Sand Bog (<a href="chf_chf7.htm#7.31" class="topiclink">7.31</a>) can still apply; an Alternate Terrain Type (<a href="chf_chf13.htm" class="topiclink">13.</a>) takes precedence]</span>. If also using Overlay E1, see <a href="chf_chf12.htm#12.51" class="topiclink">12.51</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.2" class="topiclink">F.2</a> illustration. Aside from any Start/Stop MP, the truck in 25C6 would expend four MP (Chapter B Open Ground) to enter C7, or seven MP (6 [enter wadi] + 1 [Desert Open Ground] = 7) to move INTO D6.</span></p>
<p><a id=".3"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.3 DESERT VP:</span> To reflect the increased importance of vehicles in the desert campaign, any scenario that specifies Desert VP (DVP) uses the following method of calculating VP for Guns and vehicles eliminated/captured/exited as per <a href="cha_cha26.htm#26.2" class="topiclink">A26.2-.22</a>:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Gun: a Gun's DVP value equals 10% (FRU) of its printed BPV (even if dm/malfunctioned);</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Vehicle: a vehicle's DVP value equals 10% (FRU) of its printed BPV (even if its MA is malfunctioned/disabled) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: see <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.3a" class="topiclink">F.3A</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>For ease of use, each Gun's/vehicle's DVP value is printed in red in the upper left hand corner of its depiction on the scenario card. This number does not include the point value of whatever PRC the vehicle contains at scenario start. The point value of units/equipment other than Guns and vehicles are not changed by the use of DVP.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: As per <a href="cha_cha26.htm#26.21" class="topiclink">A26.21</a>, but excluding points for its crew/armor-leader (if any), a German 37L AT is worth two points if eliminated, as is an 88L AA. Likewise, a PzKpfw IVF2 is worth a maximum of four, an SdKfz 7 is worth one point, and an SdKfz 7/1 is worth a maximum of two. However, if DVP are specified, the point value of these pieces when eliminated becomes as follows: 37L AT, three; 88L AA, six; PzKpfw IVF2, eight; SdKfz 7, two; SdKfz 7/1, six. Any Inherent crew (or Inherent HS) eliminated/exited with a vehicle is worth another two points.</span></p>
<p><a id=".3a"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.3A VARIABLE DVP VALUE:</span> U.S. and German mortar halftracks (SPW 250/7, SPW 251/2; M4, M4A1, M21), the British IP Carrier 3-in. Mortar, and the British 2pdr Portee all have as their Inherent MA a Gun that may be Removed/unloaded. If the Inherent MA of one of these vehicles is currently Removed/unloaded, the vehicle's DVP value is &quot;2&quot; if it is an AFV, or &quot;1&quot; if it is not; otherwise, its DVP value is calculated as per <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.3" class="topiclink">F.3</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The SPW 250/7's DVP value is &quot;2&quot; if its mortar is currently Removed, or &quot;5&quot; if it is not. The 2pdr Portee's DVP value is &quot;1&quot; if its 40L AT is currently unloaded, or &quot;4&quot; if it is not. The DVP value of a vehicle not listed in F.3A—e.g., the Carrier 2-in. or 3-in. Mortar, or a 3-ton lorry porteeing a 57L AT (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhmultibritordnotes.htm#b" class="topiclink">British Ordnance Note B</a>)—is the same regardless of whether or not it is currently &quot;carrying&quot; that weapon.</span></p>

<p><a id=".6"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.6 GERMANS: </span>Due to their devotion to Rommel and to a miserly troop replacement rate, a high proportion of the infantry in the 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions and the 90th Light Division should be elite when used in 1942-43 DYO scenarios.</p>
<p><a id=".7"></a><img src="f07.gif" width="112" height="56" alt="F07" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">F.7 MINEFIELDS:</span> Due to the often mobile nature of the war in North Africa, minefields were usually well marked so friendly troops would not accidentally enter them. Hence, special minefield counters have been included in <span class="f_Emphasis">WEST OF ALAMEIN</span>. These are termed Known Minefield counters, and are treated as normal mines except as specified otherwise. Known Minefield counters have the normal depiction on the front but list no attack strength; the reverse side is the same but with the strength shown. When Known minefields are called for in any scenario, during his setup the owner places the desired number of these counters onboard (with the strength-side down). Once the strength of such a counter has been revealed, it is flipped over. Known Minefield counters may represent minefields previously discovered by reconnaissance or in a previous engagement; therefore, Known minefields are set up onboard even in night scenarios. If a Known Minefield counter has its strength reduced or eliminated by OBA/bomb attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">B28.62</a>), that counter is replaced by one having the appropriate new strength (or by a Dummy Minefield counter [<a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.7b" class="topiclink">F.7B</a>] if its strength was eliminated); if its strength was unrevealed at the time, its new strength remains unrevealed. Known minefield factors may not be exchanged for booby trap capability, nor may Known A-P mines be exchanged for any type of A-T mines or vice-versa. The use of Known mines is not restricted to any particular type of board/scenario. Known minefield factors have the same BPV as hidden mines, and are indicated on the DYO Purchase Roster by adding &quot;Kn&quot; in the &quot;TYPE&quot; column of the &quot;Fortifications&quot; section where the purchase was recorded.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A player whose OB contains 24 Known minefield factors may set up two Known Minefield counters with 12 factors each, or three with 8 factors each, or four with 6 factors each, or two with 6 factors each plus one with 12 factors, etc.</span></p>
<p><a id=".7a"></a><img src="b2846.jpg" width="146" height="62" alt="b2846" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">F.7A</span> A second type of Known Minefield counter contains an arrow. Whenever a player wishes to have a multi-hex Known minefield along a Hex Grain (or Alternate Hex Grain), he may place two such counters along it with the arrow on each counter pointing towards the other in the same manner as if they were Barrage counters (<a href="che_che12.htm#12.11" class="topiclink">E12.11</a>), but with no limit to the number of hexes allowed between them. Such placement indicates that each hex between (and inclusive of) them along that (Alternate) Hex Grain contains a Known minefield. The type(s) and strength(s) of mines (if any; <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.7b" class="topiclink">F.7B</a>) in each such hex must still be recorded. A hex containing Known mines can incorporate only one A-P/A-T minefield, regardless of how many multi-hex Known minefields that hex is part of.</p>
<p><a id=".7b"></a><img src="f07b.gif" width="113" height="57" alt="F07B" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">F.7B DUMMY MINEFIELDS: </span>Some Known Minefield counters have &quot;Dummy&quot; printed on their reverse side in lieu of a FP factor, thus representing Dummy minefields. When the opponent discovers that it is a Dummy (which must be announced when any <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> ground unit enters, or successfully Searches [<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.152" class="topiclink">A12.152</a>], its Location), simply remove it from play <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if an unmined hex is thusly discovered in a minefield laid out as per <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.7a" class="topiclink">F.7A</a>, mark that hex with a Dummy Minefield counter]</span>. A Dummy minefield is unaffected by a K/KIA resulting from a bomb/OBA attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">B28.62</a>). The number that may appear beneath a Dummy Minefield counter depiction in a printed scenario OB represents the number of Dummy counters allotted. In a scenario that does not allot Dummy minefields (which includes all DYO scenarios), a player may add (at no extra BPV cost) one Dummy Minefield counter to his OB for every 24 Known minefield factors he sets up. In addition, in any scenario in which a player has received ≥ one Dummy Minefield counter, he may make a Secret dr (halved; FRD) and receives an additional number of Dummy mine counters equal to the result.</p>
<p><a id=".7c"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.7C HIDDEN MINES:</span> Known Minefield counters may also be used to mark hexes containing hidden mines whose presence (but not strength) is discovered by either Searching (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.152" class="topiclink">A12.152</a>) or by a unit's being subjected to a mine attack DR therein. In addition, any &quot;normal&quot; Minefield counter (i.e., one of the types covered in Section <a href="chb_chb28.htm" class="topiclink">B28</a>) is considered to indicate the presence of Known mines when placed onboard. Normal mines may not be otherwise exchanged for or converted to Known mines.</p>
