<p>A T-H Hero creation attempt is a &quot;?&quot;-loss activity (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.141" class="topiclink">A12.141</a>). An attempt made in the MMC's MPh costs no MF (and hence qualifies neither it nor any resulting Hero as a target of Defensive First Fire), but if it is to be made after the MMC has expended MF it must await the resolution of all Defensive First Fire prompted by the MMC's immediately preceding MF expenditure. An attempt made in the CCPh must await the determination of any possible Ambush, and the resolution of all (if any) ATTACKER Ambush attacks, in that Location. A stack of MMC may attempt to create T-H Heroes &quot;simultaneously&quot;, but must make individual dr; if this is done during a friendly MPh/APh, those MMC who rolled &quot;simultaneously&quot; can then move/advance in that phase only as a stack. When a T-H Hero is created (or voluntarily loses HIP; <a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.422" class="topiclink">1.422</a>), the AFV (or unit/Fortification; <a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.424" class="topiclink">1.424</a>) that allowed his appearance becomes his Designated Target.

(Note that a crew set up manning a Gun counts as a squad for stacking—not for HIP squad-equivalency—purposes; and that leaders do not count towards total squad-equivalency for Japanese HIP purposes.) If it were a night scenario he could use HIP in the same manner, but for three squads or for two squads and both crews and even if he were not the Scenario Defender. In all cases, if the scenario is DYO he does not purchase this HIP—it is free (<a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.66" class="topiclink">1.66</a>); and any HIP granted by, e.g., <a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.34" class="topiclink">A12.34</a>/SSR/DYO-purchase simply increases the total number of units he can set up hidden.
