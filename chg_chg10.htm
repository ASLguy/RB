<p><a id="10.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.1</span> Animal-Pack rules allow certain types of Guns (listed in <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.2" class="topiclink">10.2</a> and <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.61" class="topiclink">10.61</a>) and SW (<a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.7" class="topiclink">10.7</a>) to be <span class="f_Emphasis">carried</span> (not towed) by Horse counters that have been specially designated as having that capability. A Gun capable of being thusly carried is termed a <span class="f_Emphasis">Pack Gun</span>. A Horse counter designated by a scenario (or by DYO purchase; <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.6" class="topiclink">10.6</a>) as being capable of carrying a Pack Gun is termed a <span class="f_Emphasis">Mule</span>. A Pack Gun being carried by a Mule (i.e., one on such a Horse counter) is referred to as an <span class="f_Emphasis">Animal-Packed</span> Gun or as being <span class="f_Emphasis">Animal-Packed</span>; conversely, a Mule carrying a Pack Gun is said to be <span class="f_Emphasis">Animal-Packing</span> it. The overall process of removing a Pack Gun from its Mule and setting it up on the ground is termed <span class="f_Emphasis">Unpacking</span>; and the reverse of this process is called <span class="f_Emphasis">Packing</span>. A Pack Gun may be Animal-Packed/(Un)Packed any number of times during play, depending on its M# and the status of its crew. A Mule is treated as a Horse counter for all purposes except as stated otherwise. A Mule may <span class="f_Emphasis">never</span> carry a Rider (not even that Gun's crew), be voluntarily &quot;deployed&quot; into two &quot;HS&quot; Mules, nor create any type of horse/SMC-Mule.</p>

Animal-Pack counters are not removed at the end of the CCPh. The only Personnel unit that may become Pack-TI is a non-PRC, Good Order <span class="f_Emphasis">crew</span> counter of the same nationality as the Pack Gun it possesses. Such a crew may become Pack-TI only during RPh Step 1.13B at the start of a Game Turn. A Pack-TI crew <span class="f_Emphasis">may</span> conduct any type of activity that is normally prohibited by TI status, but if it does—or if it becomes pinned or not in Good Order—it immediately loses its Pack-TI status unless stated otherwise (e.g., see <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">10.31-.33</a>). A crew is subject to Hazardous Movement penalties while Pack-TI, regardless of phase. Each attack conducted by a Pack-TI crew is modified as Area Fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: TI DRM apply in CC]</span>. A Pack-TI Pack-Gun/Mule may not be fired, Pushed, moved or advanced. Once Pack-TI, neither a Pack Gun nor a Mule can lose that status until it has completed an (Un)Packing Period (<a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">10.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="10.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.2 ANIMAL-PACKING:</span> Any 76-82mm MTR, as well as any other Gun allowed by an Ordnance Note (see also <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.61" class="topiclink">10.61</a>), may be Animal-Packed; however, the Gun must be dm/limbered if possible. Only a &quot;squad&quot; (<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.32" class="topiclink">A13.32</a>) Mule counter may Animal-Pack a Gun, and may Animal-Pack only one such Gun at a time. The Gun being Animal-Packed is placed on top of the Mule; while on the Mule it may never be fired, Pushed, hooked up, unlimbered or assembled, and is considered to be possessed by the crew &quot;accompanying&quot; (<a href="cha_cha13.htm#13.7" class="topiclink">A13.7</a>) that Mule <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: in a panji Location the crew is &quot;accompanying&quot; the Mule only if both of those units are above or beneath that Panji counter]</span>. A Gun being Animal-Packed is not considered a portaged SW for MF purposes, nor is it eliminated if its un-&quot;accompanied&quot; Mule is in terrain that calls for the elimination of unpossessed equipment <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if unloaded therein; <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">10.31</a>]</span>. A non-Mule horse may not Animal-Pack a Gun of any type, nor may a Mule Animal-Pack a non-Pack Gun.</p>
<p><a id="10.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.21 STACKING:</span> A crew possessing an Animal-Packed Gun is considered a squad for stacking purposes (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">A5.5</a>).</p>
<p><a id="10.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.3 (UN)PACKING:</span> To (Un)Pack a Gun onto/from its Mule, they and the crew must all occupy the same terrain in the same Location (e.g., all of them must be beneath any Panji counter in their Location [<a href="chg_chg9.htm#9.52" class="topiclink">9.52</a>]; an entrenched crew cannot [Un]Pack a Gun because the Mule cannot occupy the entrenchment). An Animal-Pack counter is placed above the Gun, Mule and crew during Step 1.13B of the <span class="f_Emphasis">initial</span> RPh of a Game Turn. All must then remain Pack-TI for a number of <span class="f_Emphasis">complete</span> Game Turns called the <span class="f_Emphasis">(Un)Packing Period</span>, which is equal to &quot;12 minus that Gun's M#, plus one if not a MTR&quot; <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: the minimum (Un)Packing Period may never be &lt; one complete Game Turn]</span>. For Animal-Pack purposes, a complete Game Turn runs from (and includes) the start of the first RPh in that Game Turn through the end of the second CCPh in that Game Turn. If the crew for any reason loses its Pack-TI status prior to the end of the (Un)Packing Period, the Game Turn in which this occurs no longer counts toward the total number needed to complete that Period. When the Gun, Mule and crew have remained Pack-TI for the required number of Game Turns, the (Un)Packing Period has been completed; the Animal-Pack counter is removed as part of Step 1.13B in the next RPh, and normal capabilities return to all involved. In a night scenario the (Un)Packing Period is always twice its normal length.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A British Infantry crew and a 94mm INF Gun on a &quot;squad&quot; Mule occupy the same Open Ground Location at the start of the second Player Turn of Turn 1 in a day scenario. Their owner wishes to begin Unpacking the Gun, but he cannot at this time because it is not the initial RPh of the Game Turn. So at the start of Turn 2 in RPh Step 1.13B he places an Animal-Pack counter above the Gun, Mule and crew. Since the Gun's M# is 10, its Unpacking Period will comprise three entire Game Turns (12 - 10 [M#] +1 [non-MTR]=3); thus it will last (at least) through the end of Turn 4.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">All successfully remain Pack-TI throughout Turn 2, but during the first Player Turn of Turn 3 the crew uses its Inherent FP to attack an enemy unit, using Defensive First Fire and then Subsequent First Fire. Its first attack is treated as Area Fire and removes its Pack-TI status for the remainder of Turn 3 (<a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">10.11</a>), while its second attack is not Area Fire because it is no longer Pack-TI. Since the crew is no longer Pack-TI, Game Turn 3 cannot count as part of the Unpacking Period. Hence, if the crew becomes Pack-TI again as soon as it can (which would be in RPh Step 1.13B at the start of Turn 4), it will have to remain Pack-TI through the end of Turn 5.</span></p>
<p><a id="10.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.31</span> &nbsp;If the crew is Pack-TI at the start of the <span class="f_Emphasis">Player</span>-Turn RPh that follows the completion of <span class="f_Emphasis">half</span> of the (Un)Packing Period, it (un)loads the Gun from/onto the Mule at that time as part of RPh Step 1.13B. This action causes no loss of Pack-TI status, and the Gun's owner may freely set its CA as it is unloaded. However, a Pack Gun that is unloaded into a fordable Water Obstacle, non-dry stream, Irrigated paddy, marsh, swamp or onto a Bank counter is eliminated.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Continuing the above example, if the crew had not fired beforehand and thus not lost its Pack-TI status, it would have unloaded the Gun to beneath the Mule during RPh Step 1.13B of the second RPh of Turn 3, since half of the Unpacking Period would have been completed at the end of the first Player Turn in Turn 3 (3 [Unpacking Period Game Turns] ÷ 2 = 1½ Game Turns). But since it did fire, it cannot unload the Gun from the Mule until the second RPh of Turn 4. Once the crew does unload it, the Gun will still not be able to fire or be moved, etc., because it will still be Pack-TI until its Unpacking Period is finished (<a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">10.11</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="10.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.32 dm/LIMBERED:</span> If otherwise allowed, a Pack-TI Gun may be repaired/(un)dismantled/(un)limbered in the normal manner, but only by a Pack-TI crew and only if the Gun is not currently loaded on a Mule. Such actions cause no loss of Pack-TI status, nor does the subsequent loss of that TI status negate any of those actions.</p>
<p><a id="10.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.33</span> &nbsp;If a player Unpacking a Gun decides to Pack it back onto the Mule (or vice-versa) while all involved are Pack-TI, he states this intention in RPh Step 1.13B in the initial RPh of a Game Turn. The new (Un)Packing Period then begins, and lasts a number of complete Game Turns (as defined in <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">10.3</a>) equal to the net number already spent (Un)Packing the Gun, but otherwise the same procedures are followed and cause no loss of Pack-TI status. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: If the Gun was unloaded from its Mule involuntarily (i.e., via a <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">10.4</a> dr), the new Packing Period would be determined as per <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">10.3</a>.]</span></p>

Gun and Mule (but not the crew) also become (or remain, along with the crew) Pack-TI <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Gun is unloaded into prohibited terrain (see <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">10.31</a>), it is eliminated and Pack-TI status is NA]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="10.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.41</span> &nbsp;All applicable results of the dr occur immediately, with no other penalty. If Low Ammo occurs, mark the Gun with a Low Ammo counter (which changes its current B# to an X# and creates a new B# one &lt; that new X#). If a Pack-TI Mule is eliminated/Casualty-Reduced <span class="f_Emphasis">after</span> its Pack-TI Gun has been unloaded, the dr is still made; however, all dr results other than the occurrence of Low Ammo are ignored. The effects of each Low Ammo occurrence (including SSR-designated Ammunition Shortage) vs the same Animal-Packed/Pack-TI Gun are cumulative (place extra Low Ammo counters on it as called for). A Gun that survives a dr on this table must still go through a <span class="f_Emphasis">complete</span> <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">10.3</a> (Un)Pack-ing Period (no Mule is required if it was eliminated) before it can lose its Pack-TI status.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Continuing the above example, assume it is now Turn 5, the Gun was unloaded as per <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">10.31</a> in Open Ground during the second RPh of Turn 4, and it, the Mule and crew have remained Pack-TI. During this turn a fire attack causes Casualty Reduction to the Mule but does not eliminate the Gun. The subsequent dr (<a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">10.4</a>) is an Original (and Final) 3, but since the Gun is unloaded it is immune to elimination/malfunction results, and the dr causes it only to be marked with a Low Ammo counter (which changes its original B11 to B10 and X11). The Gun and the (now-&quot;HS&quot;) Mule remain Pack-TI, as does the crew if it survived the fire attack unbroken and unpinned. If the crew remains Pack-TI through the end of Turn 5, at the start of the first RPh in Turn 6 it, the Gun and the Mule will all have their Animal-Pack counter removed (thus enabling the Gun to be fired. Pushed or hooked up—though with a Low Ammo counter on it).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A moving &quot;squad&quot; Mule Animal-Packing a dm 81mm MTR (with a Manhandling # of 11 and a Breakdown # of 12) in Open Ground is Casualty Reduced by a Defensive First Fire attack, and the subsequent dr is an Original (and Final) 3. The dm Mortar counter is immediately unloaded to beneath the (now-&quot;HS&quot;) Mule and is marked with both a Gun Malfunction and a Low Ammo counter. In addition, the Gun and Mu!e (but not the crew) are also marked with an Animal-Pack counter. Both the Gun and Mule must remain Pack-TI (and thus cannot be fired, moved or advanced) until they have gone through an entire one-Game-Turn Unpacking Period conducted as per <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">10.3</a> [EXC: the mortar could be moved again by going through a <a href="chg_chg10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">10.3</a> Packing Period to place it back on another &quot;squad&quot; Mule in order to use Animal-Pack movement).</span></p>

If this causes the Gun to suffer another Low Ammo result, it will be marked with a second Low Ammo counter and its Breakdown and Disablement numbers will become 10 and 11 respectively.
