Each Cave counter represents a separate subterranean Location (referred to hereafter as a cave), with its own above-ground entrance, in/IN its hex. Caves are both Rally-Bonus (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.61" class="topiclink">A10.61</a>) and Concealment (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">A12.12</a>) Terrain <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: see <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.33" class="topiclink">11.33</a>]</span>. <span class="f_Emphasis">For cave setup purposes see also <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.91" class="topiclink">11.91</a>.</span></p>
<p>A Cave counter may be set up either IN a Depression (including a Sunken Road or Hill Depression; <a href="chb_chb4.htm#4.2" class="topiclink">B4.2</a> and <a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.5" class="topiclink">B19.5</a>), or in a non-Depression (including an Elevated Road; <a href="chb_chb5.htm#5.21" class="topiclink">B5.21</a>) hex that shares a hill/cliff Crest Line hexside with another hex whose Base Level is <span class="f_Emphasis">lower</span> than the Base Level of the Cave counter's hex; however, no Cave counter may be set up in a building, rubble, marsh, swamp or Water Obstacle hex or IN a non-dry stream. Each Cave counter set up in a non-Depression hex must have its arrow pointing across a hill/cliff Crest Line hexside (of its hex) to the center dot of an adjacent lower-Base-Level hex that contains no Irrigated-paddy/sand/marsh/swamp/water-(even a hexside pond) whose level is ≥ that <span class="f_Emphasis">cave's</span> level (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.11" class="topiclink">11.11</a>). Each Cave counter set up IN a Depression must have its arrow pointing directly <span class="f_Emphasis">away</span> from a <span class="f_Emphasis">non</span>-Depression hexside (of its hex) whose other common hex has a Base Level (or Crest level— whichever is higher) &gt; that cave's level, <span class="f_Emphasis">and</span> that arrow must also point across a Depression (including a Crest-Line-Depression; <a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.5" class="topiclink">B19.5</a>) hexside to an adjacent Depression hex. In all cases, the hexside a Cave counter's arrow points <span class="f_Emphasis">to</span> is called its <span class="f_Emphasis">CA Hexside</span>. No two caves in the same hex may have the same CA Hexside. If a cave is set up in a non-Depression hex, the <span class="f_Emphasis">other</span> hex common to its CA Hexside is termed its <span class="f_Emphasis">Entrance Hex</span>. If a cave is set up IN a Depression, its <span class="f_Emphasis">own</span> hex is its Entrance Hex.</p>
<p>Only Infantry/SW/a-non-vehicular-Gun may be set up in a cave. The non-hidden contents of a cave are placed onboard beneath that Cave counter, while all above-ground contents of the hex are placed (and considered to be) above all Cave counters in that hex.</p>
<p><a id="11.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.11 LEVEL:</span> The cave's elevation level is determined as follows. If the Cave counter is set up:</p>
<p><a id="11.111"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.111</span> &nbsp;IN a Depression, the cave's level equals the Base Level of its Entrance Hex;</p>
<p><a id="11.112"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.112</span> &nbsp;in a non-Depression hex and its CA Hexside is a non-cliff hex-side or a one-level cliff, the cave's level equals the Base Level (or Crest level—whichever is higher) of its Entrance Hex;</p>

A cave set up in this manner should use the side of a Cave counter with &quot;L0&quot;, &quot;L1&quot;, &quot;L2&quot; or &quot;L3&quot; on it, to indicate the cave's actual level (see the <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.6" class="topiclink">11.6</a> illustration). If a cave's level is &gt; the Base Level (or Crest Level—whichever is higher) of its Entrance Hex, that cave is termed an <span class="f_Emphasis">Upper-Cliff</span> cave.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Up to five caves may be set up in 25F7, with each using a different hexside of that hex as its CA Hexside; however, hexside F7-G7 cannot be used as a CA Hexside because it is not a hill/cliff Crest Line hexside. Each cave in F7 would be at Level 2 (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.112" class="topiclink">11.112</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Only one cave may be set up IN F6, and only if F6-E7 is its CA Hexside; this cave would be at Level 1 (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.111" class="topiclink">11.111</a>), and F6 would be its Entrance Hex (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.1" class="topiclink">11.1</a>). No cave may be set up IN F6 with F6-G7 as its CA Hexside, because the Base Level of hex E6 (Level 1) would not be higher than that Level 1 cave (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.1" class="topiclink">11.1</a>). For the same reason, no cave may be set up IN G7.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Two caves may be set up IN E8: one with E8-D7 as its CA Hexside and the other using E8-E9 for its CA Hexside; both would be at Level 1.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">No cave may be set up IN E9, because such a cave would not have ita arrow pointing away from hexside E9-D8 or E9-F8 while simultaneously having E9-E8 or E9-E10 as its CA Hexside (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.1" class="topiclink">11.1</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A cave in I7 with I7-H7 as its CA Hexside (thus making H7 its Entrance Hex) may be set up at Level 2 or 3 at its owner's option (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.113" class="topiclink">11.113</a>); if set up at Level 3 it would be an Upper-Cliff cave.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="g1113ex2.gif" width="298" height="398" alt="g1113ex2" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: Two caves may be set up in 36I4 (one with I4-H3, the other with I4-H4, as its CA Hexside)—but only if the stream is not flooded. If it is flooded, the water level in hexes H3 and H4 would be Level 0, thus equalling the level of any caves in I4 and thereby prohibiting their setup in that hex. Likewise, no cave may be set up in I4 with I4-I3 as its CA Hexside because I3 is Level 0 marsh.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A cave set up in K4 with K4-L4 as its CA Hexside is at Level 1; if its CA Hexside were any other hexside of K4 [EXC: hexside K4-K3, which is NA as a CA Hexside], the cave would be at Level 2.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A cave in K2 with K2-J1 (or K2-K1) as its CA Hexside must be at Level 0 despite the two-level elevation change along its CA Hexside (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.112" class="topiclink">11.112</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A cave may be set up in J4 with J4-I4 as its CA Hexside even though J4-I4 is a road hexside.</span></p>

The CA of a Cave counter <span class="f_Emphasis">excludes</span> all (even Aerial) Locations in that Cave counter's hex, other than that of the cave itself <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: the CA of a Cave counter IN a Depression includes the area IN its hex]</span>. A hex half in and half out of a cave's CA is considered to be completely within that CA for the purposes of <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.5b" class="topiclink">C.5B</a> <span class="f_Emphasis">only</span>, even though part of that hex actually <span class="f_Emphasis">is</span> outside that CA. A Cave counter can never have its CA changed during play, and must have it recorded when set up using HIP. For the CA of a Gun in a cave, see <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.92" class="topiclink">11.92</a>.</p>
<p>EX: The CA of caves A (at Level 3 in its Level 4 hex) and B (at Level 2 IN its hex) are shown by the white lines. A unit at ≥ Level 4 in hex 25BB5 is not within the CA of cave A. Infantry in Crest status in DD2 is within cave A's CA only if the word &quot;Crest&quot; on the counter lies along hexside DD2-DD3 or DD2-EE3. A vehicle in Crest status (<a href="chf_chf5.htm#5.42" class="topiclink">F5.42</a>) in DD2 is not within cave A's CA if its Crest CAFP is at either vertex of hexside DD2-CC2. Above-ground Infantry IN BB6 are within cave B's CA, but would not be if they were in Crest status.</p>

<p><a id="11.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.2 &nbsp;CAVE COMPLEXES</span>: Cave Complexes are Fortifications that are available only to the Japanese. Up to 25% (FRD) of the original number (see <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.91" class="topiclink">11.91</a>) of Cave counters in the Japanese OB may be considered <span class="f_Emphasis">Primary</span> Cave counters. Each Primary Cave counter has an associated Cave Complex that abstractly represents a series of underground passageways extending from the cave's Location, thus enabling Japanese Infantry to move unseen from one point to another. Each Cave Complex comprises the hex that contains its Primary Cave counter plus any/all other hexes within two hexes of that counter <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: no hex containing any Irrigated-paddy/-sand/marsh/swamp/Water-Obstacle-(including a hexside pond)/non-dry-stream may ever be a Cave Complex hex, nor may a Cave Complex extend past any such hex(es) (or past any sunken/elevated road hex[es]</span>) so as to isolate any hex(es) of that Complex from the rest of its hexes; Cave Complexes may not overlap (i.e., each hex that would be inside the boundaries of ≥ two Cave Complexes must be assigned {on the CCSS; <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.32" class="topiclink">11.32</a>} to just one of them)]. No Primary Cave counter may be set up in an elevated road hex. Each Cave Complex is both Rally-Bonus and Concealment Terrain, and is considered <span class="f_Emphasis">one multi-hex, subterranean Location</span> separate from all other Locations (even pillbox/cave Locations set up within its boundaries). Only Infantry/SW/non-vehicular-Gun(s) may be set up in a Cave Complex.</p>
<p><a id="11.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.3 HIP:</span> Cave counters, as well as their contents, are always considered to be in Concealment Terrain regardless of the other terrain in their hex and always set up hidden. Cave Complexes and their contents always set up hidden. HIP for caves, Cave Complexes, and their contents is in addition to all other HIP allowed to the Japanese side. Normal rules for HIP and HIP-loss apply to Cave counters (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.33" class="topiclink">A12.33</a>/<a href="che_che1.htm#1.16" class="topiclink">E1.16</a>/<a href="chg_chgintro.htm#.2" class="topiclink">G.2</a>) and their contents except as stated otherwise (see <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.31" class="topiclink">11.31</a> and <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.75" class="topiclink">11.75</a>). A Cave counter set up in a jungle, kunai or bamboo hex is considered to occupy that terrain type for the purposes of <a href="chg_chgintro.htm#.2" class="topiclink">G.2</a>, provided its CA Hexside is not also a cliff hexside.

Assume streams to be shallow. The triangles represent hidden caves A-H, whose counters and occupants set up in Cloaking Boxes A-H respectively. Caves A and G are Primary caves, and their two Cave Complexes (referred to as AA and GG respectively) are shown. Cloaking Box AA will be used to hold Cave Complex AA's occupants, and Cloaking Box GG will hold those in Complex GG. A hidden pillbox is also present, with its CA centered on hexspine Y6-Y7 and its counter and occupants in Cloaking Box I. The pillbox's Inherent tunnel (<a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.632" class="topiclink">1.632</a>) leads into Complex AA. A second (SSR-designated, for the purpose of the example) tunnel runs (as per <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.933" class="topiclink">11.933</a>) from Complex AA to above-ground in hex T6. Caves E and F are within the boundaries of neither Complex. If cave G were set up in W8, the boundaries of Complex GG could (but would not need to) have been drawn to include hex(es) W6/X6 and thus the pillbox/its-tunnel, provided those hexes were not also part of Complex AA. Note that neither Cave Complex contains any marsh/swamp/stream hex; nor are hexes V10, X10and Y10 part of Cave Complex GG, because they would be isolated from the rest of that Complex (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">11.2</a>).</span></p>

The Climbing unit may attempt to Place its DC only when it is one level above the cave. The attempt is allowed despite the fact that no LOS exists between the unit and the cave.

Each SMOKE-grenade/Direct-Fire-ordnance attempt to place SMOKE <span class="f_Emphasis">into a cave itself</span> must predesignate that cave as its target; such attempts may be made even during a Heavy Wind. Indirect Fire cannot place Smoke in a cave, but can place WP in a cave <span class="f_Emphasis">if</span> it achieves a WP CH vs that non-hidden cave Location. WP successfully placed (by any means) in a cave is automatically a CH therein, and uses the reversed TEM applicable to that type of attack. Smoke dispensers (<a href="chd_chd13.htm" class="topiclink">D13.</a>) cannot place smoke in a cave.</p>
<p>An attempt to place SMOKE grenades in a cave may be made if the placing unit is either in, or is in a position where a DC could be Thrown into (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.833" class="topiclink">11.833</a>), that cave. Such an attempt made from above-ground succeeds only upon making a Final Thrown-DC dr of ≤ 3 as per <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.833" class="topiclink">11.833</a> (i.e., as if the unit were Throwing a DC). Each ½&quot; SMOKE counter placed in a cave remains onboard (beneath that Cave counter) and in effect until the <span class="f_Emphasis">end of the Player Turn</span> in which it was placed.</p>
<p>A Direct-Fire ordnance attempt to place SMOKE in a cave requires the firer to have a LOS to the target cave and to use the <span class="f_Emphasis">Infantry</span> Target Type. The +2 Basic TH# modification for firing SMOKE at ≤ 12 hexes (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.4" class="topiclink">C4.4</a>) is NA, but the cave's +4 TEM (TH Case Q) applies. If the Final TH DR yields a hit (and the Original TH DR is ≤ the SMOKE Depletion number), the appropriate SMOKE is placed beneath the Cave counter. Acquisition <span class="f_Emphasis">may</span> be gained (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.832" class="topiclink">11.832</a>), and retaining Multiple ROF <span class="f_Emphasis">is</span> possible.</p>
<p>A predesignated attempt to place SMOKE in a cave which fails only due to too high a subsequent-dr/TH-DR causes the SMOKE (if created) to be placed at the Base Level of that cave's Entrance Hex, but <span class="f_Emphasis">no</span> WP NMC ensues from that attempt.</p>
<p>SMOKE in a cave is not considered to exist in the rest of that hex, nor does SMOKE above all Cave counters in a hex exist in those caves. Contrary to <a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.8" class="topiclink">A24.8</a>, the &quot;outgoing LOS&quot; DRM of SMOKE in a cave equals twice that SMOKE's current maximum applicable DRM (instead of an additional + 1).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.321" class="topiclink">11.321</a> illustrations. SMOKE placed in hex W4 but outside of caves B and C is considered to rise from Level 2 and does not affect LOS to/from those caves.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">A non-moving, BU Sherman tank in Z8 (but not in Bypass) attempting to fire SMOKE into non-hidden cave B or C would have to predesignate one of them as its target (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.81" class="topiclink">11.81</a>); and using the Infantry Target Type would place a SMOKE counter beneath its targeted Cave counter on an Original TH DR of 2 or 3 (the Basic (and Modified) TH# is 8, and the total TH DRM equal + 5 (+4 [TEMJ and +1 [BU])]. If its Original TH DR is ≥ 4 but ≤ the SMOKE Depletion number, the SMOKE would instead be placed in W5 (if cave B were the target) or X4 (if cave C were the target).</span></p>
