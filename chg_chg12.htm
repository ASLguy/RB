A LC cannot be set Ablaze in any other manner. A vehicle aboard a LC can be turned into a burning wreck in the normal manner for whatever type of attack strikes it.</p>
<p>Whenever a LC or a Passenger vehicle/wreck aboard a LC becomes Ablaze, a Blaze counter is placed on that LC (and, for a Passenger vehicle/wreck set Ablaze while in a Cloaking Box, a &quot;duplicate&quot; Blaze counter is placed on that wreck). When placed on the LC, that Blaze is also marked with a Pin counter (which is removed at the end of the next CCPh). When a Passenger burning wreck is removed from its Cloaking Box and placed onboard on its LC, its &quot;duplicate&quot; Blaze counter is removed from the LC; if the latter is pinned, that Pin counter is placed on the wreck's Blaze— otherwise it is not marked with a Pin counter. Each unpinned Blaze on a LC reduces that LC's MP allotment by one and, in the AFPh of each Player Turn, inflicts one DP on it. For other Blaze effects see <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.43" class="topiclink">12.43-.44</a> and <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.84" class="topiclink">12.84</a>.</p>
<p>No Blaze aboard a non-immobilized, non-Beached LC has any smoke effect whatsoever; i.e., neither its Inherent, nor any Drifting, smoke is considered to exist. When a LC carrying any Blaze(s) becomes Beached/immobilized, or when the first Blaze appears on a Beached/immobilized LC, the Inherent-smoke effects of its Blaze(s) come into existence immediately (and any drifting smoke would appear in the following AFPh). Smoke drifting from &gt; one Blaze aboard the same LC is indicated on the board by using one gray Smoke counter per hex.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: An LCM(3) carrying two unpinned Wreck Blazes has its MP allotment reduced by two, and receives two DP in the AFPh of each Player Turn. If instead the LC itself were Ablaze and was also carrying one Wreck Blaze, the same effects would apply.
