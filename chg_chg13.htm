<p><a id="13.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.1 OVERLAYS:</span> Any overlay whose ID is prefixed by &quot;Be&quot; is a Beach overlay, and each of its hexes is a Beach hex. Any overlay whose ID is prefixed by &quot;OC&quot; is an OCEAN overlay, and its hexes are Ocean, Lake or River hexes (see <a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.12" class="topiclink">13.12</a>). Cutting out and positioning these overlays follows the principles given in <a href="chg_chgintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">G.9-.9D</a> except as stated otherwise herein. Beach and OCEAN overlays use a unique grid-coordinate system: each Beach-overlay hex has a three-digit, and each OCEAN-overlay hex has a four-digit, coordinate; when such an overlay hex is referred to, its printed coordinate—not the coordinate of the hex (if any) it covers—will always be specified. Each Beach overlay will generally lie partially on and partially off of its setup mapboard; after it is set up, the pertinent OCEAN overlay will be positioned part on and part off that Beach overlay, with the end result that the Beach overlay partly overlaps the mapboard and is partly overlapped by the OCEAN overlay.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chg_chgfootnotes.htm#28" class="topiclink">28</a></span> Unless stated otherwise, all Beach and OCEAN overlay hexes are playable even if they lie beyond the mapboard edge(s).</p>
<p><a id="13.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.11 Be7:</span> Overlay Be7 is used on board 7 or 8 in conjunction with an OCEAN overlay to depict the mouth of a river. The Water Obstacle hexes of this overlay are always River (<a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.2" class="topiclink">B21.12</a>; see also <a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.12" class="topiclink">13.12</a> below). A river cannot be flooded (<a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.122" class="topiclink">B21.122</a>) when Overlay Be7 is in play (hence the river hexes of that overlay are always at Level -1).</p>
<p><a id="13.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.12 &nbsp;OCEAN/LAKE/RIVER:</span> &nbsp;An OCEAN overlay may be used to represent part of a lake or wide river instead of ocean. For rules purposes, the term &quot;Ocean&quot; refers only to that particular type of Water Obstacle, while &quot;OCEAN&quot; is defined to mean &quot;Ocean, Lake or River (as applicable to the scenario)&quot;. OCEAN rules apply to <span class="f_Emphasis">mapboard</span> (and Overlay Be7) river hexes only if ≥ one OCEAN-overlay hexside covers ≥ one of those mapboard-river hexsides. An OCEAN river (i.e., an OCEAN overlay defined as a river, plus all mapboard/Overlay-Be7 river hexes treated as OCEAN) still uses river current as per <a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.121" class="topiclink">B21.121</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Board 7 is in play. Even if an OCEAN overlay is also in play (e.g., being used in conjunction with Overlay Be7), as long as no OCEAN-overlay hexside covers a board-7 river hexside, normal Chapter-B River rules are in effect for that board-7 (and Overlay-Be7) river; thus if the river is defined as fordable/shallow, Fording—not Wading (<a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.42" class="topiclink">13.42</a>)—rules are in effect (and LC cannot run Aground as per <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.21" class="topiclink">12.21</a>) in those river hexes. However, if any OCEAN-overlay hex-side does cover a board-7 river hexside (e.g., using OCEAN overlays to cover one side of the river so that the other side in effect becomes an uneven shoreline), then those river hexes would be considered OCEAN hexes, and the rules for Wading and running Aground would apply in all shallow-OCEAN hexes.</span></p>
<p><a id="13.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.13 &nbsp;INHERENT TERRAIN:</span> Mapboard- (but not counter-)depicted Inherent Terrain (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.6" class="topiclink">B.6</a>) is negated in that portion of its hex <span class="f_Emphasis">covered over</span> by any part of a Beach/OCEAN overlay <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Bypass is NA; <a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.81" class="topiclink">13.81</a>]</span>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: LOS drawn along a hexside common to a Beach hex and a dense-jungle hex (<a href="chg_chg2.htm#2.2" class="topiclink">2.2</a>) is not blocked by that jungle, since that part of the dense-jungle hex covered by the Beach overlay is no longer Inherent Terrain. However, any SMOKE/Wreck/AFV/Rubble counter in that jungle hex would still Hinder that LOS [EXC: as per <a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">D9.4</a>], and Bypass along that hexside would be NA.</span></p>
<p><a id="13.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.14 &nbsp;EFFLUENT:</span> Any overlay whose ID is prefixed by &quot;Ef&quot; is an Effluent overlay, and each of its hexes with blue stream-like artwork is an Effluent hex. When cutting out an Effluent overlay, do so just <span class="f_Emphasis">inside</span> of its exterior hexsides (i.e., as per <a href="chf_chf12.htm#12.1" class="topiclink">F12.1</a>). An Effluent overlay represents the water from a stream flowing across the beach; therefore, each Effluent hex is treated as a Hard-Sand (<a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">13.3</a>) Beach hex in which Entrenchments are NA.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chg_chgfootnotes.htm#29" class="topiclink">29</a></span> An Effluent hex is unaffected by stream depth. For LOS/LOF purposes, each hexside common to both a stream hex and an Effluent hex is considered a stream hexside as per the last sentence of <a href="chg_chgintro.htm#.1" class="topiclink">G.1</a> (i.e., as if that Effluent &quot;end-hex&quot; too were a stream hex). Frigid-water effects do not apply in an Effluent hex. A frozen Effluent hex is Ice that cannot collapse.</p>
<p><a id="13.15"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.15 &nbsp;ISLAND:</span> There are no Island overlays per se, but some scenarios will use land (e.g., woods, orchard, etc.) overlays as Islands.

Each hexside common to both a Beach hex and a Hinterland hex is termed a <span class="f_Emphasis">Beach-Hinterland</span> hexside. Each hexside common to both an OCEAN hex and a Beach hex is termed a <span class="f_Emphasis">Beach-OCEAN</span> hexside. SSR will define the Slope of the Beach as Slight, Moderate or Steep, which will affect LOS, MF/MP costs and TEM along/across Beach-OCEAN/Beach-Hinterland hexsides and also determine the number of shallow-OCEAN hexes (<a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.4" class="topiclink">13.4</a>).</p>

The 4-5-8 would expend one MF to enter H9.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the beach is Moderately Sloped, all the same LOS exist. However, if the 4-4-8 or the 3-4-7 fires at any U.S. squad, or if the 4-4-7 fires at the 5-5-8 or the 4-5-8, that target will receive a +1 deir TEM. If the 4-5-8 were in Melee and the 6-6-8 fired at its hex, it would receive deir TEM. Hidden ordnance in D8 that fires at one of the LC will treat it as a HD target, but hidden ordnance in F9 would treat only LC &quot;E&quot; and &quot;H&quot; as HD.

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the beach is Steeply Sloped, the 4-4-8's LOS to U.S. units is limited to LC &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, and the 4-4-7 has a LOS to all U.S. units except the 4-5-8 and LC &quot;H&quot;. Neither the 3-4-7 nor any hidden unit in D8 has a LOS to any U.S. unit. However, the 6-6-8, 5-5-8 and 4-5-8 could gain Crest status along the Beach-Hinterland hexside(s) of the hex each occupies, in which case they would appear as entrenched to the Japanese squads [EXC: the 6-6-8 would not be entrenched vs the 4-4-7; <a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.92" class="topiclink">B20.92</a>]. The 6-6-8 and 4-5-8 have a LOS to each other regardless of whether one, both or neither of them is in Crest status.

<p><a id="13.91"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.91 &nbsp;REEF:</span> If the scenario will be Allied-vs-Japanese, set in 1943-44, and will use the OCEAN overlay(s) to represent Ocean, a dr is made after setting up all mapboard(s) and Beach overlay(s) but <span class="f_Emphasis">before</span> placing the OCEAN overlay(s) and purchasing units. If this Final dr is ≥ 5, a reef exists. A -1 drm applies if the amphibious side is wholly non-U.S. Unless the players agree otherwise, the reef will comprise the (Alternate) Hex Grain that lies adjacent to the (Alternate) Hex Grain of Ocean hexes forming the amphibious side's entry/exit area.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: If a reef exists on Overlay OC1, and if hexrow 1001-1013 is the amphibious side's entry/exit area, the reef will lie in hexes (i.e., in hexrow) 1014-1026.</span></p>
<p><a id="13.92"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.92 BEACH SLOPE:</span> Make a dr to determine the beach's Slope. A -1 drm applies if a reef exists. If the Final dr is ≤ 2, the Slope is Slight; if 3 or 4 it is Moderate; if ≥ 5 it is Steep.</p>
<p><a id="13.93"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.93 BEACH WIDTH:</span> Determine the High- and Low-Tide width of the beach (i.e, its minimum and maximum possible width in Beach hexes between the Hinterland and OCEAN). If the beach is Slightly or Moderately Sloped, make a DR: the colored dr divided by two (if it is Slightly Sloped) or by three (if it is Moderately Sloped) equals (FRU) its High-Tide width; the white dr divided by the same number (i.e., by two or three; FRU) and then added to the High-Tide width equals the beach's Low-Tide width. If the beach is Steeply Sloped, its High- and Low-Tide widths are always one and two hexes respectively.</p>
<p><a id="13.94"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.94 PURCHASES:</span> Both sides make all DYO purchases. The BPV cost to Waterproof a vehicle is &quot;2&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="13.95"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.95 DEFENDER SETUP:</span> Set up all OCEAN overlays. If they represent Ocean, set them up so that the beach is at its Low-Tide width; otherwise, set them up to show the beach is at its High-Tide width. The player judged to be defending the beach then sets up; see also <a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.5" class="topiclink">13.5</a> and <a href="chg_chg14.htm#14.2" class="topiclink">14.2-.21</a>.

This, in conjunction with <a href="chg_chg13.htm#13.93" class="topiclink">13.93</a>, determines the beach's actual width for the scenario. Note that this may alter the setup terrain of (and thus might eliminate; <a href="chg_chg14.htm#14.56" class="topiclink">14.56</a>) some/all Beach Obstacles. In addition, if a reef exists, a High Tide makes it Submerged while a Low Tide makes it Exposed. All Bore Sighting in what are now deep OCEAN hexes is lost.
