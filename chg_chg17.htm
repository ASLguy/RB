<p><a id="17.151"></a><span class="f_Strong">17.151</span> The following apply to the U.S.M.C. side for DYO purposes. The respective overall ratio of U.S.M.C. 4-5-8 rifle squads to 5-5-8 BAR squads must be ≥ 3:1 at the time of purchase. 4-5-8s may be purchased using a BPV of &quot;13&quot;, in which case they are considered Defense Battalion squads. 5-5-8s may be purchased using a BPV of &quot;14&quot;, in which case they are considered Paramarine squads; or using a BPV of &quot;15&quot;, in which case they are considered Raider squads. (The BPV of Defense Battalion, Paramarine and Raider HS remain unchanged.) For SW allotment purposes the Equivalency of Defense Battalion, and of Paramarine/Raider, squads must be calculated separately from all other squad types in the U.S. OB—as indicated by their separate SW Allotment Charts. The U.S.M.C. Rifle/BAR Squad SW Allotment Chart allots FT and DC to 7-6-8 squads regardless of whether or not they are Assault Engineers. The U.S.M.C. Leadership Generation factor (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.8" class="topiclink">H1.8</a>) is &quot;4.5&quot;. See <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanobaswtables.htm" class="topiclink">here</a> for the U.S.M.C. SW Allotment and OBA charts.</p>

However, see also <a href="chg_chg14.htm#14.21" class="topiclink">14.21</a>.</p>

For rules purposes, P.A. Personnel are considered U.S. Army units; however, neither Heat of Battle nor ELR Replacement can transform a P.A. MMC into a non-P.A. U.S. MMC or vice-versa (hence a P.A. 4-4-7, or its HS, that Battle Hardens becomes Fanatic). This restriction applies even in early-war scenarios in which P.A. Personnel counters are actually being used to represent rear-echelon/badly-disorganized U.S. Army (as opposed to P.A.) troops.</p>
<p><a id="17.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">17.3 &nbsp;INHERENT CREWS:</span> In scenarios vs Japanese, U.S. Inherent AFV crews have a Morale Level of 8 and U.S. Inherent non-AFV crews have a Morale Level of 7.

<p>• &nbsp; The scenario is vs Japanese and set in/after 7/44 (or is vs Germans and set in/after 8/44); and</p>
<p>• &nbsp; After determining (as per SSR or <a href="che_che7.htm#7.21" class="topiclink">E7.21</a>) that the FB is/are armed with bombs, the U.S. player makes a Napalm Availability Secret Final dr of ≤ 1 (a -2 drm applies if the scenario is vs Japanese). One dr determines the type of bombs for all of that side's FB <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if the SSR specifies that the FB is/are carrying HE (only) bombs, the Napalm Availability dr is NA]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="17.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">17.41 EFFECTS:</span> Napalm bombs are treated the same as HE bombs for TH purposes <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: napalm always receives an extra -1 TH DRM, and Target Size (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">C6.7</a>) TH DRM do not apply; napalm cannot achieve a CH]</span>. A hit by napalm is treated as an attack by a 24-FP FT except as stated otherwise. Napalm FP is not halved by HIP/concealment or Long Range, but is halved if the attack used the Area Target Type. A napalm attack vs a cave can also attack other caves Accessible (<a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.6" class="topiclink">11.6</a>) to it, as per <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.834" class="topiclink">11.834</a>; see also <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.86" class="topiclink">11.86</a>. Napalm neither causes Air Bursts nor leaves Residual FP. A napalm hit is resolved as a single attack vs all in-LOS targets (both friendly and enemy) in the hex, using one Effects DR<span class="f_EXC"> [EXC: napalm has no effect on any unit/SW/Gun that is in shallow/deep water other than a non-flooded stream]</span>. Despite the fact that napalm normally creates smoke (see below), it may be used after another weapon has fired non-SMOKE ammunition in that same phase.</p>
<p><img src="g1741.gif" width="88" height="72" alt="g1741" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />An Original K/KIA napalm attack result does not cause a Flame as per <a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.12" class="topiclink">B25.12</a>. However, any hit by napalm <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: one that occurs in shallow/deep water other than a non-flooded stream]</span> results in the immediate placement of a Blaze counter at the Base Level of the target hex (or Entrance Hex, vs a cave; see <a href="chg_chg11.htm#11.86" class="topiclink">11.86</a>), even if that hex is not Burnable Terrain, and the simultaneous placement of a white +3 Smoke counter (which represents the smoke from that Blaze) directly beneath that Blaze—even if Gusts/Heavy-Winds/Rain/Mud/Deep-Snow are in effect. All Blaze/Smoke rules apply in the normal manner except as stated otherwise. When that Smoke counter is removed from the board (such removal is possible only as per <a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.4" class="topiclink">A24.4</a>), that napalm Blaze counter is removed as well if it is in non-Burnable Terrain; if it is in Burnable Terrain, the player who placed it must at that time make a Kindling DR as per <a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.13" class="topiclink">B25.13</a>, and if the Final DR is ≥ that terrain's Kindling number that napalm Blaze instantly becomes a Terrain Blaze. If Heavy-Winds/Rain are in (or come into) effect, the Smoke counter that accompanies a napalm Blaze is considered to exist only for the purpose of determining when that Blaze will be removed or transformed into a terrain Blaze; however, Gusts/Mud/Deep-Snow have no effect on napalm smoke.</p>
<p>When the napalm Smoke counter is removed from the board, a separate Random SW Destruction dr is made on the IFT's 12 FP column for each non-subterranean SW/Gun still in the hex that contained the napalm Blaze. A +1 drm applies to a SW/Gun in a pillbox. A napalm Blaze itself does not affect any Fortification or cause a vehicle/wreck to be removed from play.</p>
