<p><a id="18.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.1</span> Chinese troops are of two distinct types: Nationalist (&quot;G.M.D.&quot;) and Communist (&quot;Red&quot;).

A 3-3-7 may Battle Harden to a 5-3-7 (or a 1-2-7 HS to a 2-2-7 HS) only if 5-3-7s form the Majority Squad Type (<a href="che_cheintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">E.4</a>) of the G.M.D. OB that is currently in play.

However, if a Commissar fails to rally a Red Chinese unit, the latter is not Replaced/eliminated—it simply remains broken <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Fate; <a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.64" class="topiclink">A10.64</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="18.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.4 &nbsp;EQUIPMENT:</span> All Chinese use Chinese (i.e., two-tone color) SW, Guns and vehicles. Neither Red nor G.M.D. Chinese treat Chinese SW/Guns as Captured, even if one side captures them from the other during play. Each SW Scrounged/Removed from a Chinese vehicle is represented by the appropriate Chinese SW.</p>

<p><a id="18.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.42 &nbsp;OBA:</span> Chinese OBA normally receives five black and two red cards/chits. However, if the original Majority Squad Type (<a href="che_cheintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">E.4</a>) of the full Chinese OB is 5-3-7, its OBA is assumed to have Plentiful Ammunition; if that Majority Squad Type is 3-3-7 or 3-3-6, it is assumed to have Scarce Ammunition <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: for DYO see <a href="chg_chg18.htm#18.82" class="topiclink">18.82</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="18.421"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.421 RADIO:</span> The Contact number of a Chinese radio is &quot;8&quot; if the original Majority Squad Type of the full Chinese OB is 5-3-7, &quot;7&quot; if that Majority Squad Type is 4-4-7, or &quot;6&quot; otherwise.</p>

<p><a id="18.44"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.44 &nbsp;VP:</span> A Gun, dm 76-82mm MTR, or vehicle, of the Chinese side which is Captured by the opponent has its regular VP value quadrupled (instead of doubled) at the end of play.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chg_chgfootnotes.htm#46" class="topiclink">46</a></span></p>

Each armed, Good Order Infantry Dare-Death Squad (or its surviving HS) that at the start of its MPh is in/ADJACENT-to a Location containing an unpinned, Good Order, friendly Personnel leader, and that is within eight MF of an enemy ground unit to which it and that leader have a LOS, may at that time go berserk voluntarily <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: it cannot thusly go berserk if it/that-leader is marked with a Prep/Bounding/Pin/TI counter, nor if any marsh/swamp/cliff/unbridged-Water-Obstacle would prevent it from reaching that enemy unit's hex during that MPh, nor if that enemy unit is in an OCEAN Location]</span>. The berserk MMC must then charge that enemy unit (now considered its Designated Target) and attempt to enter its Location. The leader (and/or any other Good Order friendly leader stacked with that berserk MMC) may (but need not) go berserk at the same time, provided each such leader is Infantry to whom none of the conditions given in the above EXC apply; each who does go thusly berserk must charge that same enemy unit. Infantry that voluntarily go berserk automatically return to normal at the end of that Player Turn <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if in Melee at that time, they remain berserk until no longer in Melee]</span>. Use a red-on-white Berserk counter to indicate a unit that has gone berserk voluntarily.</p>
<p>A leader, whether created from a Dare-Death MMC or not, cannot go berserk voluntarily except as stated above. However, when a Dare-Death MMC does go berserk voluntarily, any hero(es) stacked with it (and allowed to move) may accompany it during that MPh; in that MPh, each such hero is assumed to have eight MF <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: three MF if wounded]</span> and may enter the Designated Target's Location—but may not move in the subsequent APh.</p>
<p><a id="18.61"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.61 &nbsp;HUMAN WAVE:</span> No unit that voluntarily goes berserk (or accompanies it as per <a href="chg_chg18.htm#18.6" class="topiclink">18.6</a>) may also be used to form a Human Wave in that Player Turn, or vice-versa.</p>
<p><a id="18.62"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.62 &nbsp;CC:</span> Dare-Death MMC enter into and resolve Hand-to-Hand CC as if they were Japanese. In addition, each non-Hand-to-Hand CC-vs-Personnel attack in which ≥ one armed, unpinned <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">[errata included]</span> Dare-Death MMC participates receives an extra -1 DRM.

The presence of ≥ one 5-3-7 squad in the Chinese OB precludes the purchase of another Chinese squad type for that scenario, and vice-versa. 5-3-7 squad(s) may be purchased only for scenarios set in 11/43-3/45 in Burma (see also <a href="chg_chg18.htm#18.81" class="topiclink">18.81</a>).<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chg_chgfootnotes.htm#48" class="topiclink">48</a></span> Red Chinese may not be purchased for a scenario set in Burma. The BPV of Red Chinese squads and HS is one &gt; their Partisan BPV; that of their crews is one &gt; their Russian BPV.

<p><a id="18.81"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.81 &nbsp;BURMA:</span> Prior to making purchases for a G.M.D.-vs-Japanese scenario set in 3-5/42 or 11/43-3/45, make a dr. If that Original dr is ≤ 3, the scenario is considered set in Burma. Otherwise it is set in China.</p>

The Scarce- or Plentiful-Ammunition status of G.M.D. OBA (<a href="chg_chg18.htm#18.42" class="topiclink">18.42</a>) is based on the current Majority Squad Type of its OB at the time of that battery's purchase.</p>
