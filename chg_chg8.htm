A paddy consists of two parts: the <span class="f_Emphasis">interior</span>, which is brownish-green on the overlay; and the <span class="f_Emphasis">banks</span>, which are the narrow Open-Ground-color areas along the hexsides of that hex. Units in the interior of a paddy are said to be IN it, while those on (as opposed to just crossing) its banks are placed above a Bank counter (<a href="chg_chg8.htm#8.21" class="topiclink">8.21</a>) in the hex. Being &quot;in&quot; a paddy hex refers to being in either/both position(s). Units in a paddy hex are at level 0 (assuming the overlay is on level 0 terrain). Paddies will always be defined by SSR as being Drained, Irrigated or In-Season.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chg_chgfootnotes.htm#19" class="topiclink">19</a></span> For DYO situations in which this information is not known, make a dr to determine the state of all paddies in the scenario:</p>

Such Infantry may not be riding bicycles but may be &quot;leading'' horses. In addition to the possible cost for crossing a bank hexside, the IN-hex COT of a paddy is dependent on whether the interior is Drained, Irrigated or In-Season: if Drained, normal Open Ground MF/MP costs apply; if Irrigated, the entering unit must expend <span class="f_Emphasis">twice</span> the cost of entering Open Ground <span class="f_Emphasis">mud</span>; if In-Season, the unit must expend grain MF/MP.</p>

An Infantry unit above a Bank counter is considered to enter INTO its hex <span class="f_Emphasis">only</span> (and does so immediately) when it expends the applicable IN-hex COT to do so (including during the RtPh/APh) or when it becomes broken or pinned, enters into Melee or its Column Disbands. If thusly forced INTO its hex by becoming pinned or broken during its MPh, the unit is assumed to expend the COT for such entry even if exceeding its remaining MF (this does not force placement of a CX counter), is no longer subject to Hazardous Movement, and unless pinned is subject to the -1 FFNAM DRM until its MPh ends. Low-Crawl <span class="f_Emphasis">onto</span> a Bank counter is NA.

<p><a id="8.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.5 &nbsp;MUD:</span> Mud can exist in/IN paddy hexes in two ways: they may be Irrigated (<a href="chg_chg8.htm#8.12" class="topiclink">8.12</a>), and/or EC may be Mud. Irrigated paddies are mud only IN those hexes, unless EC are Mud. Whenever EC are Mud, all mud rules (<a href="che_che3.htm#3.6" class="topiclink">E3.6-.65</a>) apply in (as well as IN) all paddy hexes even if they are In-Season (note that the extra MF/MP cost of mud is already included in the IN-hex COT of Irrigated paddies as given in <a href="chg_chg8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">8.2</a>). The extra MF/MP cost of mud (<a href="che_che3.htm#3.64" class="topiclink">E3.64</a>) applies to entry onto a Bank counter <span class="f_Emphasis">only</span> if EC are Mud and the unit is changing hexes.

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chg_chg8.htm#8.2108" class="topiclink">8.2108</a> illustration, and assume the paddies are Drained and EC are Mud. Squad B begins its MPh by declaring Double Time and moving INTO oL3 at a cost of one MF (the extra ½ MF for EC mud does not apply; <a href="chg_chg8.htm#8.2108" class="topiclink">8.2108</a>). Next it moves INTO oM3 at a cost of 2½ MF(1 [cross bank hexside] + ½[EC mud] +1 [enter INTO Drained paddy] =2½.

The use of a Bank counter is NA in a paddy hex that contains any Wire or Panji counter.
