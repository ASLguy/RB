Granatnik wz. 36:</span> Fire support in both infantry and cavalry units was provided by wz.30 and wz.36 platoon mortars. These small 46mm mortars were of Polish design and fired a .76kg round. Around 3850 were produced through 1939 and 81 were issued to each infantry division with three per company.</p>

<p>The latter aspect was quickly copied by other armies for some ATR and AT guns. Despite the high muzzle velocity, the small calibre and lighter weight of the projectile robbed the ATR of much of its effectiveness. The success of this ATR in 1939 was due as much to the thin armor found on contemporary German and Soviet AFVs as it was to the use of APCR ammunition. 3500 were produced and kept in sealed boxes labeled &quot;Rifles for Uruguay&quot; (hence the &quot;Ur&quot; designation). Although they were not issued until the war actually began, the fact that they functioned just like normal bolt-action rifle greatly simplified training and actual usage. The game piece also represents the British Boys ATR used in limited numbers by the Greeks.</p>

Nearly 450 were in Polish service in 1939. In spite of its antiquity, it was suprisingly successful against armor—mainly because of the crews. Horse artillery crews were the elite of the Polish cavalry.</p>

This piece (with a Manhandling # of 8 and RF of 1.6) also represents the 75mm AP wz.36 (&quot;<span class="f_Emphasis">armata preciwlotnicza</span>&quot; or anti-aircraft gun) which was the only Polish artillery piece designed and built in Poland. It entered service in 1936, and although 342 guns had been built by the war's outbreak, only 44 had been delivered to their respective units.</p>

DBT:</span> Designed by Belgian Denis-Bertrand-Trois (hence the name), the DBT was a small mortar launching a 600g grenade from 130-585 meters. The grenade fuse was non-adjustable, exploding 12 seconds after launch. This often resulted in the grenade rolling around for several seconds after landing, thus allowing the target to take cover.</p>
<p>†Due to the fuse delay, the DBT does not generate an Air Burst (<a href="chb_chb13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">B13.3</a>), as indicated by &quot;No Air Burst&quot; on the counter.</p>

<p><a id="7"></a><img src="almiord7_zoom50.png" width="204" height="97" alt="AlMiOrd7" style="border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. M76A: </span>Between the two world wars, the Belgian army searched for a replacement to the old short-barreled Schneider 75mm guns and DBT mortars. Low military budgets forced the use of captured German WW1 trench mortars. A large stock of 76mm German <span class="f_Emphasis">Minenwerfers</span> were still available with an ample supply of ammunition. Called the <span class="f_Emphasis">Mortier de 7.6cm Allemand</span> (M76A), this gun had a small removable wooden wheeled carriage that could be horse-drawn. To fire the mortar indirectly, the wheels were removed and the gun was set on a platform. Direct fire was possible with the wheels in place. This mortar was used against vehicles and tanks as well as personnel. Unloading the mortar from the caisson required approximately 5 minutes and was a strenous task at best. The gun could be manhandled by six men or dismantled and carried by nine. They were used in the &quot;<span class="f_Emphasis">batteries d' infanterie</span>&quot; with 12 guns per battery, each battery having four sections of three guns.</p>
<p>†This weapon may be Pushed <span class="f_Erratastrikethrough">or Towed (as if a non-Mortar)</span><span class="f_Highlight">{DB3}</span> in either Limbered or Unlimbered mode, but may only use Direct Fire while Limbered. While Unlimbered, it may only use Indirect Fire (as if a Mortar).</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">{DB3}</span>See also <a href="chh_alliedminornotes_chhmultiallminordnotes.htm#a" class="topiclink">Allied Minor Ordnance Note A</a> and <a href="chh_alliedminornotes_chhmultiallminordnotes.htm#d" class="topiclink">D</a>.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="almiord8_zoom50.png" width="202" height="98" alt="AlMiOrd8" style="border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. &nbsp;7.6cm FRC:</span> Another model of WW1 German trench mortar pressed into service after major changes were made by the <span class="f_Emphasis">Fonderie Royale de Canons</span> (FRC). The gun was restored in a way to allow it both direct and indirect firing capabilities from the same carriage, a significant enough change to warrant building a completely new version. The new carriage had split trails and two metal wheels, and could be transformed into a trench mortar by simply removing the trails (which gave it a trajectory of 45-80 degrees and a range of 650-2200 meters). A Belgian infantry regiment contained 2 platoons with 2 sections of 2 guns each in the <span class="f_Emphasis">battalion d'engins</span> (heavy weapons battalion). 198 were available in May 1940.</p>
<p>†This Gun may also use Indirect Fire, for which purpose its range is &quot;16-55&quot; hexes and its ROF is 3 (if using Direct Fire it has no such minimum range and a ROF of 1). All rules applicable to firing a MTR (including the possibility of Spotted Fire and retaining Multiple ROF) apply to this Gun for Indirect Fire purposes. However, it may not use both Direct and Indirect Fire in the same phase (treating the MPh and DFPh as one). Switching from Direct to Indirect Fire or vice-versa does not cause loss of Acquisition.</p>

C47 FRC M32:</span> Each infantry division had one company of 12 guns shared by three batteries of 4 guns each. The Model 32 was manufactured by FRC and nicknamed the &quot;<span class="f_Emphasis">quatre-sept</span>&quot;, or forty-seven. It was used to equip the T-13 and ACG1 tanks, and was also used in pillbox fortifications. The gun had a two-trail carriage and was transported on wheels that had to be removed when setting the gun into firing position.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="almiord10_zoom50.png" width="203" height="94" alt="AlMiOrd10" style="border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. C75 TR:</span> This gun was a licenced version of the German Krupp 75mm M1905 field gun built by FRC. It was the main artillery piece of the Belgian army. 1 battery equalled 3 guns, 3 batteries equalled a group. The C75 TR (TR stands for &quot;<span class="f_Emphasis">tir rapide</span>&quot;, or quick shooting) often equipped two groups of an artillery regiment. 396 pieces were in service in 1940, all horse-drawn. (See <a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhjapaneseordnancenotes.htm#12" class="topiclink">Japanese Note 12</a>.)</p>
<p> <a id="11"></a><img src="almiord11_zoom50.png" width="202" height="98" alt="AlMiOrd11" style="border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. C75 GP:</span> The <span class="f_Emphasis">canon de 75 Grande Portee</span> was a 1918 modification of the standard Belgian C75 TR involving a marriage of the Belgian 75 to the German WW1 <span class="f_Emphasis">10.5cm leFH 16's</span> field carriage (types I and II are identical for game terms). These guns were used by the Germans as the 75mm <span class="f_Emphasis">FK 233(b)</span> and <span class="f_Emphasis">234(b)</span>. This gun had pneumatic tires for transport, but used standard artillery wheels while firing. In an emergency, the gun could be fired while on transport tires for a short time. Three four-gun batteries formed an artillery group. Most artillery regiments had four groups towed by Latil tractors. This piece also represents the horse-drawn type III used by the cavalry.</p>

Machinecannon 20mm M-35:</span> The Danes foresaw the use of armor in the upcoming conflict, but were almost powerless to defend against it. A limited pre-war defense budget forced the use of weapons initially designed for one role to serve dual-purpose roles once the war broke out. One such weapon was the Madsen 20mm Autocannon. Initially designed for Denmark's airforce, the Autocannon was converted to use on the sidecar of the Nimbus motorcycle (see <a href="chh_alliedminornotes_chhalliedminorvehiclenotes.htm#24" class="topiclink">Allied Minor Vehicle Note 24</a>) and pressed into both anti-personnel and anti-tank roles.</p>

<p> In total, the Yugoslav artillery park numbered some 7000 guns, of which 4000 could have been termed modern. These included 356 mountain guns, 300 field guns, 732 100mm howitzers, and 44 very heavy guns. Much of this equipment ended up in Italian hands. Tito's Partisans used various captured Italian and German ordnance pieces and from July 1944 were supplied with British 6-pounder AT guns.</p>

Brandt Medium Mortar:</span> Various versions of the French 81mm mortar were used in just about every army that wielded infantry support weapons. Bought, sold, and sometimes stolen, it was the staple of the modern infantry company from the 1930s into the 1950s. (See <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 3</a>.)(Belgium 5/40 RF 1.3) (Greece 10/40-5/41 RF 1.5)</p>

<p>Poland <span class="f_Emphasis">wz. 31</span>: There were approximately 1200 81mm mortars in the Polish arsenal by 1939. Distribution to their allotted infantry units was uneven due to incomplete plans to equip each infantry battalion with 4 pieces. Independent HMG companies had 6 to 9 mortars, while &quot;<span class="f_Emphasis">KOP</span>&quot; battalions and cavalry regiments were issued 2. (9/39-10/39 RF 1.2)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia <span class="f_Emphasis">81mm M31</span>: 1600 were in service as the standard mortar in independent mortar companies. (4/41 RF 1.1)</p>

After some tinkering, a simplified version with a sharply sloped gunshield was settled on, and it was bought, licensed, and copied by at least 7 different nations in the 1930s. The British army in Egypt acquired some and used them in North Africa in 1941-42. A variety of mid-war Japanese and Russian anti-tank gun designs suggest that the Swedish Bofors was an integral part of their design. By 1939, Poland had about 1200 <span class="f_Emphasis">wz. 36</span> in service which were credited with 120-150 tank and 100 armored car kills during the brief campaign. Nearly all were horse drawn, excepting those of the mechanized brigades and motorized anti-tank companies which used PZInz 302T artillery tractors or transported the guns <span class="f_Emphasis">en-portee</span> on P-F 621L or Ursus (i.e., Medium) trucks.

Over 20,000 were manufactured during the course of the war. In addition to Germany and the USSR, this gun was bought by Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Finland, Greece (10/40-5/41), Japan, Spain, and Turkey, as well as being the model for versions by the U.S. and the Netherlands (which this piece also represents [5/40], and which equipped its <span class="f_Emphasis">Pantserwagon</span> armored cars).
