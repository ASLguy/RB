TKS &amp; TKS(L):</span> After the acquisition and trial of the British Carden-Lloyd MK VI tankette in 1929, Poland purchased the rights to produce the vehicle and set about developing a Polish version dubbed the TK-3. The first models started to roll off the assembly lines of the PZInz Works in August of 1931 and 300 were produced before the introduction of the TKS in 1934 (both vehicles are represented by the TKS counter since they were similar in all aspects). Production of the TKS ended in 1937 with 293 being built. Modest efforts were made to upgun the TKS tankette with two open-topped prototypes mounting a 47mm ATG and the Swedish 37mm Bofors ATG, both being labeled TKS-D. Neither was accepted, and the final version of the TKS mounted a 20mm autocannon. This version was designated &quot;TKS z 20mm dzialkem&quot; or &quot;nkm 20mm TKS&quot; after the gun denomination. The TKS(L) was to be a workshop modification of both the TKS and TK-3 models. A total of 150 conversions were planned, but by August of 1939 only 26 were finished with just 23 being delivered to fighting units. The TKS(L) were delivered to the 101st BKM, the SK of the 10th and 11th BKM and of the WBP-M, and to the 71st Armored Group (Wielkoposki BK) and the 81st Armored Group (Pomorska BK). Each of these units received 4 vehicles, except the 81st Armored Group which only received 3. The TKS(L) were used as platoon leader vehicles.</p>
<p>†Most of the TKS series of tankettes were in poor mechanical condition - lack of spare parts was always a problem, along with short track life. Therefore, each time a Mechanical Reliability DR is made for a TKS or TKS(L), an 11 &nbsp;indicates that the AFV has stalled or suffered some other mechanical problem that has prevented it from starting normally. Its owner must then immediately make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to stop, but excluding the MP expended to start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It can again attempt to move, but must expend another MP to start—and must undergo another Mechanical Reliability DR as it does so. Should the Stall result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, the AFV is considered to have expended its entire MP allotment in Delay.</p>

<p><a id="2"></a><img src="almiveh2_zoom50.png" width="203" height="200" alt="AlMiVeh2" style="border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. Vickers Edw(b) &amp;Ejw(b):</span> In 1931 the Polish Army purchased 38 Vickers-Armstrong 6-ton tanks from Great Britain. Two different models were purchased, 16 vehicles of the Model E Mk A version mounting a 47mm Vickers-Armstrong gun and a single water-cooled 7.92mm Browning machine gun and 22 of the Model E Mk B version featuring twin turrets, each housing a wz.30 7.92mm machine gun. The tanks were dubbed Vickers Ejw (for the single turret version) and the Vickers Edw (dw denoting double turrets). In 1939, the Vickers tank served in the 12th KCL of the WBP-M and the 121st KCL of the 10th Mechanized Brigade. Both formations consisted of 16 tanks (plus one in reserve), 1 for each commander and 3 platoons of 5 tanks each, with dw and jw models evenly dispersed.</p>
<p>†The Edw version of the Vickers possesses a 6FP CMG in each of two separate turrets, one on each side of the tank's chassis, as its MA. Each turret's CMG rolls its TH/TK7IFT DR separately. Furthermore, the tank must use two different TCA markers. The turrets are restricted in their TCA per the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="almiveh2ex1_zoom50.png" width="522" height="438" alt="AlMiVeh2Ex1" style="border:none" /><img src="hmfile_hash_6afbcdca.png" width="158" height="77" alt="PTCA STCA" style="border:none" />†Use separate TCA/MA Malfunction (Disabled) counters for each turret (bottom counter port turret, top counter starboard turret). Treat each turret independently with regards to CE status, ROF, TH/TK/IFT, and MA malfunction. The vehicle does not suffer MA recall unless both MGs are disabled. Any adverse effect (e.g., Stun, Recall, etc.) applies to the entire tank as if it had one turret. Only one of the turrets need be CE for the Edw to qualify for the <span style="font-family: '@Arial Unicode MS';">½</span> MP road rate.</p>
<p><img src="tko_zoom50.png" width="77" height="76" alt="TKO" style="border:none" />†TURRET KNOCK OUT: Whenever the modified TK DR of a Direct Fire non-HE (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.7" class="topiclink">C7.7</a>) turret hit is equal to the final modified TK number, the vehicle suffers a Turret Knock Out (TKO) instead of a Shock, and is marked appropriately. Which turret is affected depends upon the side of the vehicle—Port or Starboard—from which the fire emanates. If the fire emanates from directly along the hexspine of the vehicle's (rear) CA, a subsequent dr is made: 1-3 Port turret hit, 4-6 Starboard turret hit. The affected turret must BU, cannot become CE, cannot change its TCA, and has its MA Disabled. The crew then takes an Immobilization TC (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">D5.5</a>). An AFV suffering a TKO must pay an additional +1 for all subsequent shots (from the still functioning turret) that incur a Case A To Hit Modifier. All subsequent hits on a knocked out turret are treated normally.</p>
<p>†TCA &amp; CASE A: Vickers Edw turrets may change TCA simultaneously but must pay Case A (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.52" class="topiclink">D3.52</a>) penalties independently (and cumulatively).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX (see above diagram): The Port MG can attack the 4-6-7 with 6FP and +3 DRM for the TCA change, or the Starboard MG could attack with 6FP and +2 DRM, or the two MG could firegroup to attack the 4-6-7 with I2FP and +5 DRM for the cumulative TCA changes.</span></p>

In an effort to increase armor protection yet maintain running performance, a 110hp Saurer-designed diesel engine was incorporated, replacing the existing 80hp air-cooled gasoline engine. This project became known as the 7TP and would result in Poland's finest combat tank and the world's first mass produced diesel-powered tank. Two models were designed, the first being a twin-turreted version utilizing the Vickers twin turrets and designated the 7TPdw. The 7TPdw appeared in late 1934, with the first series being built and finished in early 1935. During that same year, plans for the second version—called the 7TPjw—were finalized around a brand new single turret mounting the Swedish-designed 37mm Bofors gun and a single 7.92mm machine gun. The production of this version began in the latter stages of 1937. On September 1, 1939 there were 139 examples of the 7TP in commission, with 22 dws in active service. Used partly to train tank crews, the dw did see action but most were destroyed early in the fighting or during the final days of retreat. There were two battalions (the 1st and 2nd BCL with 49 tanks each) and two companies of 7TPs (the 1st and 2nd KCL, both of the Warsaw HQ, with 11 tanks each) in existence. The 1st KCL is known to have been composed entirely of 7TPdws. A platoon of 7TPs consisted of five tanks.</p>
<p>†The 7TPdw uses all special rules for two turrets (<a href="chh_alliedminornotes_chhalliedminorvehiclenotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">Polish Vehicle Note 2</a>).</p>

They consisted of a commercial chassis along with turret armor from obsolete Polish wz.28 armored cars. Three models of this armored car were built: the wz.34 and wz.34-I were both armed with a 7.92mm Hotchkiss MG and the wz.34-II was armed with a 37mm Puteaux SA 18 gun. The three models are referred to as either version I (representing both the original wz.34 and the wz.34-I) or version II. In September 1939, eighty wz.34s of all types were in front-line service, with several more serving in training schools of the Polish Cavalry. The wz.34 was used in 10 of the 11 armored groups of the BK (21st, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 51st, 61st, 62nd, 71st, 81st and the 91st Armored Groups) with eight wz.34 AC in each: the HQ vehicle, the AC squadron leader, and 2 platoons of 3 vehicles.</p>

The first six vehicles were allotted to the Chasseurs Ardennais. In May 1940, several were in service with the 8th Company and the 2 Regiment Cyclistes Frontieres and saw combat along the Meuse River. In order to deliver accurate fire, the vehicle had to be anchored into the ground.

In 1938 330 of these vehicles were ordered. The T-13 was to equip the 16th Company of each of the 3 regiments in the <span class="f_Emphasis">Chasseurs Ardennais</span>. Each of the twelve active divisions was to contain a company of twelve vehicles. Four vehicles were assigned to the 7th Squadron of each cavalry regiment, while the Brigade of Dragoons also had a company of 12 vehicles. The <span class="f_Emphasis">Cyclistes Frontieres</span> and two light regiments were also equipped with the T-13. The T-13s were an unusual vehicle in every sense of the word. The MA and CMG were mounted in a turret that was rear-facing. This rear-facing turret was unarmored in its rear (the vehicle's forward covered arc). To fire the weapons of this tank through any direction other than the rear of the vehicle, the crew had to fold down the armored sideplates of the turret— which also required the driver to exit the vehicle. Obviously this was not a tactic commonly used, nor was it encouraged, but should a situation arise in which the vehicle were to become immobilized or bogged it was used as a last resort if the crew needed to bring the guns to bear on a target outside the vehicles rear covered arc. This design concept was meant to show the defensive role of the vehicle as the Belgian government did not want to appear aggressive in that delicate era of neutrality.</p>

In March 1934,18 Vickers Carden-Lloyd (VCL) light tanks (with a special turret) were ordered from Vickers Armstrong Ltd. in Britain. A second order of 24 vehicles was shipped in April 1935. The 1935 model of the VCL light tank built for Belgium had a more powerful engine than its English predecessor (model 1934) and its turret had a conical instead of a cylindrical shape. In Belgium, the tank was designated the <span class="f_Emphasis">auto blindee mitrailleuse</span> (a.b./Mi for short) T-15 as an attempt to conceal the offensive potential of the vehicle. The T-15s were delivered without any armament but were fitted with 13.2mm Hotchkiss MG in the turret by the Belgians. After some trials, the 42 T-15s were dispatched to the three Regiments of the 1st <span class="f_Emphasis">Division Chasseurs Ardennais</span> and to the six motorized regiments of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions. Theoretically, one platoon (peloton) of three should have equipped the 10th Motorcyclist Company of each <span class="f_Emphasis">Chasseurs Ardennais</span> regiment, and one platoon of six should have equipped the 7th <span class="f_Emphasis">escadron</span> of each of the six motorized cavalry regiments, but not all units received the full complement.</p>

The tank was judged too heavy for the terrain and given to the cavalry corps. The other eleven tanks were delivered on January 11, 1938 and sent to a factory in Gand where they were stored in an open field without turrets. In the event of mobilization, the plan was for the ACG1 to be formed into a single tank company to be known as the <span class="f_Emphasis">Escadron d'autos blindees du Corps de Cavalerie</span> (or a.b.C.C. for short), a name designed to conceal the fact that these actually were tanks.

<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">YUGOSLAV VEHICLE NOTES</span></h1>
<p>At the time of the German invasion in 1941, the Yugoslav Army had two tank battalions. The <span class="f_Emphasis">I Bataljon bornih kola</span> (I Bbk) was composed of 48 FT-17 and similar French-built tanks, and in 1937 a further squadron of 8 Skoda Sid Czech tanks was added. The II Bbk was formed in 1940 with French Char R35s, but it is not clear how many arrived in Yugoslavia prior to French surrender. The III Bbk was to be equipped with Polish 7TP light tanks but this fell through with Poland's surrender in 1939; instead the unit was formed in the Soviet Union and composed of 120 BT-7s. The III Bbk was not fully formed when the Germans invaded in 1941 and never saw action. The actual role of the II Bbk during the invasion is not clear but upon Yugoslavia's demise, the equipment from this unit was turned over to the Rumanian army. </p>
<p>The Yugoslavs had a long tradition of guerrilla resistance to foreign invaders and no sooner had things quieted down after the German invasion than partisan bands began to form in the hills of the Yugoslav countryside. Over the next four years some of these bands united under Josef Broz Tito and became the largest and most successful of all of Europe's underground forces, being the only partisan force to liberate its own country. It was also the only resistance group to field substantial armored forces. The first tank of Tito's armored force was a French Char 39H which was captured from the Germans in Serbia on September 9, 1941, and saw extensive service well into 1944. Throughout 1942 additional tanks were captured, mostly from the Italians who had assumed the bulk of anti-partisan duties in this area of the Balkans. The Italian capitulation in 1943 and increased partisan activity led to the formation of a number of <span class="f_Emphasis">tenk bataljon</span> (tank battalion) and <span class="f_Emphasis">tenk ceta</span> (tank companies). The two largest were the Tenkovski<span class="f_Emphasis"> bataljon gs nov ipo Hrvatkse</span> in Croatia, which fielded three <span class="f_Emphasis">tenk ceta</span> with a total of 12 Fiats, 1 Hotchkiss, 1 Somua, and assorted auxilliary vehicles, and the Tenkovski<span class="f_Emphasis"> Bataljon 4. korpusa novj</span> in Slovenia, which fielded 1 AB41, 1 M13/40, 6 L6s, and 4 L3s. Both of these units were supported by motorized anti-tank sections using Italian trucks and 47mm Italian anti-tank guns, as well as captured German PaK 40 anti-tank guns.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1943, Tito's partisans began to receive substantial Anglo-American assistance, in terms of both arms and training, and in early 1944 it was decided that an armored brigade would be formed. Veteran partisans were sent to North Africa and trained in the use of American and British armored fighting vehicles. In July 1944 the <span class="f_Emphasis">I Tenkovski Brigada</span> (1st Tank Brigade) was formed at Bari, Italy. The tank component was broken into 4 battalions, each with two companies. Initially, brigade strength was 56 M3A1 and M3A3 Stuarts, 24 AEC Mk II Armored Cars, and additional soft-skinned vehicles. Brigade anti-tank companies were formed with the British 6-pounder. During 1945, the brigade strength was increased to 75 Stuarts. At the same time that the 1 st Brigade was being formed in Italy, the <span class="f_Emphasis">II Tenkovski Brigada</span> was formed in the Soviet Union, consisting of 2 battalions of two companies each, for a total strength of 64 T-34/85s. Both the 1st and 2nd Brigades saw action before the war ended. During the course of the war, Yugoslav partisans claim to have destroyed or captured nearly 900 German and Italian armored fighting vehicles.</p>

The gun could be driven into position quickly and immediately engaged by the dismounted crew. &nbsp;The Nimbus sidecar counter actually represents a team of soldiers and motorcyles. The sidecar mounting the 20mm cannon was supported by another sidecar mounting an anti-aircraft machine gun and 4-6 other motorcycles.

The 2-2-8 Passenger crew may fire the AAMG with no penalty for Mounted Fire (although with the usual Bounding Fire penalty), but it may not at this point Abandon the Nimbus in order to Remove the MG (since Abandoning requires all the crew's MF). The dismounted crew fires the AT Gun and retains ROF. Wishing to fire again outside the VCA, the Nimbus (although still Stopped) changes its VCA (2 MP) and fires again (with the same +4 Case C DRM). The crew then re-mounts the Nimbus for another 6 MP (and a total of 15½ MP). If the AAMG wishes to fire this turn, it must do so now (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.51" class="topiclink">D3.51</a>). The Nimbus then starts, enters X5, and stops for 2½ MP (total of 18 MP). The crew dismounts again for 6 MP more, and fires on its last MP.

CTLS-4(a):</span> In 1940, the KNIL began a major modernization program. With Europe, and the motherland itself, either actively preparing for war or actively fighting it, an alternate source of vehicles had to be found. This left only the U.S. as a procurement source, but most U.S. factories were already committed to the expansion of the American forces or to the newly-created Lend-Lease program. The search for a company with uncommitted capacity led to Marmon-Herrington and, in 1940, the KNIL ordered a total of 600 light tanks of various new models just entering production. The first to be produced was the CTLS-4 light tank. It was built in two versions, the difference being which side of the vehicle housed the driver (some sources say this was to cater to European countries whose civilian vehicles featured a right-side driver). Design and production problems delayed the initial order until just after war had broken out in the Pacific. The Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies in January 1942. In mid-February, the first of twenty-four Marmon-Herrington CTLS-4 light tanks were delivered to the Dutch forces in Java. The tanks arrived without armament, but machine guns similar to the Browning .30 caliber were procured from the Dutch Air Force and used to equip the vehicles. The first seven' crews to be trained in the tank were issued vehicles on February 27, the day before the Japanese invaded Java. The KNIL surrendered on March 8, 1942, and the Japanese occupation forces found over a dozen of these vehicles in working order and quickly put them into service.</p>

Pantserwagen M.36 &amp; M.38:</span> In 1935-36, the Dutch took delivery of 12 Landsverk LI80 from Sweden and gave them the designation Pantserwagen Model 36. These vehicles were used to equip <span class="f_Emphasis">1e Eskadron Pantserwagen</span> (1EPaw) stationed in s'Hertogenbosch. In 1938, a second squadron (2EPaw) was formed and stationed in Amersfoort. This unit was equiped with 12 Landsverk L182 (also from Sweden and designated Pantserwagen Model 38 by the Dutch Army). Along with this shipment came 2 M.38 command vehicles, one for each squadron. Both the M.36 and M.38 were medium armored cars armed with a Bofors 37mm gun and two Lewis 7.92mm machine-guns, but their armor was thin. The command vehicles only had dummy guns. Early during the German invasion, the 1EPaw operated in Gelderland and on the Grebbe Line. They were later ordered to fall back on Fortress Holland, a naturally defensible redoubt within Holland. The 2EPaw's armored cars were stationed at the airfields of Schipol (Amsterdam), Ypenburg (The Hague), and Waal-haven (Rotterdam.) These M.38s, as well as the M.39s of the 3rd EPaw (see <a href="chh_alliedminornotes_chhalliedminorvehiclenotes.htm#28" class="topiclink">Vehicle Note 28</a>) operated in the province of Zuid Holland (South Holland) where the majority of German airborne operations took place. When the country capitulated, some of its armored cars were destroyed by their crews, although most were captured by the Germans and put to use as police vehicles. The Danish army also bought 2 Landsverk L180 from Sweden but they are not believed to have seen action.</p>

It featured all-wheel drive and had small roller wheels, mounted on the chassis about 18&quot; above the ground, in front of the rear tires to prevent the low-sitting hull from grounding when crossing obstacles. Not all vehicles, though, were fully equiped by the time the Germans invaded. The Danish Army had purchased 3 DAF M.39s, but none saw action.</p>
