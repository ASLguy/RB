<p>In 1941 each division had a light and medium artillery regiment organized in an artillery brigade. The light regiment had under its command a field gun battalion with twelve 75mm field guns and a medium howitzer battalion with eight 100mm Skoda howitzers. Each artillery battalion was also equipped with 4 heavy AAMG for its own anti-aircraft defense. These AAMG were either 8mm or French-manufactured 13mm anti-aircraft MG. The medium artillery regiment was composed of three battalions; two field gun battalions and a medium howitzer battalion. These battalions had the same table of organization as the artillery battalions in the light regiment.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1942, an Echelon II Artillery Brigade was formed, with two artillery regiments assigned just as before. However, each division also had two light artillery regiments. Each light regiment had two battalions, one with twelve 75mm field guns and a second with twelve 100mm howitzers. The artillery battalions in the 5th, 6th, and 13th Infantry Divisions each had two 25mm AA guns for local defense against Soviet aircraft. While this increase in guns helped the Romanians immensely, it still left them woefully short compared to both the Germans and the Soviets.</p>

The Voina factory bought a license to produce an additional 175 mortars and continued producing them during the war. Each infantry company had two mortars for local support in its HQ section in 1941. In 1942 Germany delivered 1500 captured French mortars to the Romanians. These were identical to their own, so one 60mm mortar was issued to each infantry platoon in 1942 and one to each cavalry platoon in 1944. Motorized infantry had a light mortar platoon throughout the war years. Each regimental heavy weapons company had a platoon of three firing sections of two mortars each.</p>

This weapon was accepted in trade under the German-Romanian Oil Pact with 669 anti-tank guns delivered by Germany from their captured Polish stocks. Two platoons of four guns each were in a 1941 infantry regiment AT Company while a motorized cavalry squadron was equipped with two 3 gun AT Platoons. The Mechanized Recon squadron had a small AT Section of two guns.</p>

So many were captured that the Romanian factories began producing their own 45mm shells for these guns. By late 1942 these guns became a standard weapon issued to Cavalry units —both horse mounted and motorized. Cavalry squadron AT units had a platoon of three guns while the Recon units had sections of two 45mm guns. After switching sides in August 1944, the Romanians were required to return all Soviet material, stripping the Romanian cavalry of their AT assets.</p>

The PaK 97/38 was an interim measure only delivered in small numbers. Concurrently, the Resita factory was developing its own 75mm AT gun based on the German PaK 40 design; its delivery began January 1943. Contemporary testing showed it to have greater armor-piercing ability than the PaK 40. Romania was only able to produce these in small numbers, but they became relatively more prevalent as the war progressed. Although 24 were delivered to the 1st Armored Division by spring 1944, only 342 were produced altogether by the end of 1944. These guns operated in platoons of three guns, and some mechanized units used the SdKfz 11 halftrack as the prime mover (<a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#99" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 99</a>).</p>

While not accepted by the Czech military, it was offered for export and bought by Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Romania.

<p>Hungarian artillery regiments were of &quot;light&quot; quality with only two mixed battalions. Each battalion had two medium howitzer batteries of 105mm howitzers and a battery of heavy 150mm howitzers. In Hungarian divisions, AA protection was provided by the artillery regiment, therefore each artillery battalion also included an AA battery of three AA sections of four 40mm AA guns each. All artillery assets were horse-drawn at the start of the war, including the AT Company. &nbsp;Each Hungarian infantry regiment had a company of 81 mm mortars, an anti-tank company with a mix of 47mm and 50mm guns, and a battery of 80mm field guns. Unlike most other armies, these latter units were not organized into a heavy weapons battalion.</p>

To compensate, Hungary created a hybrid AT gun by replacing the worn 37mm barrels with 40mm Bofors AA barrels. The 40mm 40 M produced by the Hungarian company of Manfred Weisz AG (MAVAG) was the standard towed AT gun and was also used on the 40M Turan tank. The weapon was a derivative of the Rhein-metall-Borsig 3.7cm PaK 35/36, but it fired the same ammunition as the Bofors 40mm AA gun. Hungary produced 822 of these weapons from 1940-1944.</p>

The M05/08 was capable of being broken down into three loads for transport. It was very unusual in that the barrel was manufactured of wrought bronze, one of the few guns still using bronze after 1939. This gun was only used by Hungarian cavalry units.</p>

Also called the M29, this was a reliable gun with many features that were later incorporated into the German FlaK 88mm series, most notably its cruciform platform. Hungary also built some 230 guns under license. These anti-aircraft guns were the backbone of Hungary's air defense but were considered too slow, with too high a silhouette for use as an anti-tank gun.</p>

<p>The new Slovakian Army was organized along the lines of the former Czechoslovakian Army and was outfitted with equipment left behind after the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. In May 1939 the Slovakians had over 500 pieces of ordnance in their inventory. Each Slovakian infantry division's artillery regiment (6/41-9/43) had three artillery battalions, one mountain and two howitzer. The mountain gun battalion had three batteries of four 100mm mountain guns while the two howitzer battalions each had three batteries of four 100mm howitzers. The Mobile Division's artillery regiment was upgraded to a three-battalion organization with two medium artillery battalions and a single heavy artillery battalion. Both medium artillery battalions were equipped with the 100mm howitzer in three batteries of three firing sections each. The heavy artillery battalion had three batteries of three 149mm howitzers each. The Security Division's artillery regiment (9/41-6/43) was a two-battalion regiment with each battalion being composed of three batteries of four 100mm howitzers. After 6/43 the artillery regiment was removed from command of the division and replaced by a small two-battery artillery battalion with only three 100mm howitzers.</p>
<p>Slovakian Light AA batteries were composed of four AA sections of two light AA guns (20mm) each. Heavy AA batteries (Czech 83mm and German 88mm) were normally part of the division's HQ and consisted of four guns per battery.</p>

<p>The Croatian Home Defense of the new Independent State of Croatia was created on April 11, 1941. As ill equipped as the Yugoslavian Army had been, the Croatians were even worse. From the very beginning, the Croatian military was plagued by a lack of equipment and weapons, especially heavy weapons and armor. At first only infantry units were created in five Divisional Regions, along with four independent regiments and/or battalions. Each Divisional Region had only three infantry regiments with no supporting artillery. It was not until the reorganization of November 1941 that the first artillery units were created using old Yugoslavian equipment with two battalions per division. Due to the lack of artillery pieces, each artillery battalion had only two batteries of four guns, instead of the usual three to four batteries. During the final reorganization, 21 November 1944 to 6 May 1945, some divisions had three artillery battalions.</p>
<p>The German-Croat Legion (369th Regiment, part of the German 100th Jager Division) consisted of an HQ and three battalions, each with four companies and had its own organic artillery support. The legion was destroyed by January 1943. Regimental support included an AT company with 12 PaK 35/36 AT guns and a mortar company with eight 81mm mortars. The artillery battalion had three artillery batteries each with 4 German leFH 18 Howitzers.</p>

<p>At army level, Bulgaria fielded a motorized heavy field artillery regiment with three battalions of twelve guns each. There was a 105mm field artillery battalion, a 120mm howitzer battalion and a heavy battalion equipped with 150mm or 155mm howitzers. At this level the regiment took care of the service, supply, and transport functions of each battalion.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian Army considered mountain artillery to be very important and included mountain guns in almost every Field Army, divisional and brigade formation. A mountain artillery battalion with a battalion HQ and three batteries of animal-packed 75mm mountain guns were attached to each Army.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's Army was woefully weak in anti-aircraft protection and each army's one AA battalion was used to protect its HQ and supply depots. The AA battalion had a battalion HQ and three AA batteries, each of three sections outfitted with two 20mm AA guns and two AAMG sections of two 13mm AAMG each. There was also an AAMG battery with four AAMG sections with two 13mm AAMG each.</p>

Twelve mle 37 light mortars outfitted the mortar platoon of a Bulgarian infantry regiment's close support company where it was used to provide regimental mortar support.

Germany began selling this light mortar to its potential allies before the war and continued later to replace their losses on the eastern front. Bulgaria received a number of these mortars, which were used as regimental mortar support from the mortar platoon of the close support company. Early war Croatian formations used this standard German light mortar. Later in the war they were supplied with captured mortars. The 2nd Hungarian Army used these imported mortars. Hungary received 826 of the leGrW 36 mortars between the years 1939-1944. The Slovakian Security Division (9/41-6/43) was outfitted with one light mortar per infantry platoon.</p>

After Romania occupied Odessa, the mortar manufacturing plant there kept producing this mortar until the Russian liberation.

<p>Romania bought 188 Brandt mortars and a license for Voina to manufacture more. As in all such situations, this mortar was kept in production after Romania entered the war. 360 French 81mm mortars were received from Germany in 1942. Infantry regiments used this mortar in platoons of three mortars each, while mountain mortar platoons were equipped with four mortars each. Hungary purchased many of these mortars from captured German stocks and in 1942 began producing its own model until 1944 when allied bombing destroyed the manufacturing plant. Slovakia received 10 captured Russian 82mm mortars from the German Army in early 1943.</p>

It was captured in large quantities during 1941-42 and outfitted both Hungarian and Romanian units. Hungarian production of this version began in the fall of 1943. Small numbers were produced before allied bombers destroyed production facilities in July 1944. This locally-produced mortar joined an armory of captured Dutch, Czechoslovakian, Russian, and Yugoslavian models, all of which Hungary produced ammunition for. Romania produced a copy (the Resita M42) using a captured factory in Transnistria. During the 1942 upgrade a heavy mortar company was added to each infantry, motorized infantry, and mountain infantry regiment to join the existing company of six medium mortars. In 1945 many artillery units had been decimated and could not be maintained with field guns or howitzers. To reconstitute these units, they were outfitted with twelve 120mm mortars per battalion, for which two-wheeled horse-drawn carriers were used.</p>

All are equivalent in game terms. In the late 1930s Romania ordered 160 Schneider 47mm anti-tank guns from France. The Concordia factory produced another 140 guns under license. After the fall of France, these guns were no longer available, and Romania turned to sources in Germany and Italy for 47mm AT guns, obtaining 545 Bohler (Austrian) guns in 1941 and another 275 Italian guns. Hungary's 2nd Army had 245 47mm AT guns in inventory in June 1941. One major drawback was the lack of motorized vehicles to tow these guns, requiring an awkward, heavy limber for its use with cavalry troops. Each Slovakian AT company was composed of three AT platoons of four AT guns each. The Security Division and the Mobile Brigade had one AT company per regiment.

By 1944, even some of the regular infantry AT platoons consisted of a mixed set of two PaK 38 and Bohler 47mm guns. By 1942 the Hungarian 2nd Army received 54 PaK 38 guns from Germany. At first these were issued to the 1st Armored Division and later to AT companies in the infantry regiments.

This counter, with manhandling numbers M2 and M4 respectively, also represents the later models M15/31 and M15/35. Both models had very heavy carriages requiring 6-horse and 4-horse teams to tow them. The M15/35 was designated by Germany as the 7.5cm GebK 15(t). Romania still had a number of the Skoda M15 and M28 mountain guns left over from WW1 that were used to outfit all of its mountain brigades, but these guns were rarer in infantry units. The Hungarian army had a number of M15 guns available after 1920. Between 1934 and 1935 160 of these guns were produced and issued to support the cavalry brigades and the Hungarian border guard detachments. In 1939 the Hungarian 1st Mountain Brigade received one battery of four guns for each of its four mountain battalions. Slovakia had 85 M15 guns in service in May 1939. Each regimental gun company had an infantry gun platoon of two M15 guns and two platoons of three medium mortars each at the start of the war; later the M15 was mostly replaced by the German 7.5cm leIG 18 (<a href="chh_axisminornotes_chhaxisminorordnancenotes.htm#30" class="topiclink">Note 30</a>).

The Armor Division had a motorized battalion of these guns as part of its artillery regiment. Supplies, ammunition, and parts for this weapon were not available after August 1944, when Bulgaria switched sides. Hungary also purchased this artillery howitzer from Germany in 1937. Slovakian artillery units attached to German parent formations had ongoing supply problems. To address this, the Slovak Mobile Division began receiving these German guns during March 1942, allowing both German and Slovak units to be re-supplied from the same supply points.</p>

It was upgraded in 1930 and used as heavy artillery by Soviet Divisions in 1941. Many were captured from Soviet Armies in Poland and western Russia. With deliveries of promised German ordnance falling behind, Romania repaired 209 of their captured Russian stocks of this gun and put 122mm ammunition into production during April 1943. Bulgaria had a limited number of these guns in their inventory from pre-war purchases from the Soviet Union.</p>

The M14 was one of the more important pieces in use by the Austro-Hungarian Army during WW1. After 1918 it was kept in use by the Czechoslovakian, Austrian, and Hungarian armies. The Hungarian guns had been updated by the MAVAG concern to produce the M14/35 and with later improvements the M14/39M. The various models of the M14 field gun (equivalent in ASL terms) were conventional and sturdy pieces, giving their users good service. This counter also represents the Skoda 149mm M15, which was derived from a fortification howitzer and was unusual in being designed exclusively for mechanical towing. Only 57 were built for export after 1918, divided between Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.</p>
<p>Romania gradually withdrew these guns as parts became unavailable and pieces were lost in combat. Hungary issued these guns to their corps level heavy independent artillery batteries. Slovakia had 54 of the vz. 14/16 guns and 115 of the vz. M15 guns in May 1939. The M15 was used as corps level artillery and was a part of Artillery Regiment 12. During 1944 both the Slovakian 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments were assigned three batteries of three guns.</p>

While the Austrian guns had already been withdrawn from use in 1939, the Czechoslovakian guns were still in reserve service when taken over by the Germans, who called them 15cm K 15/16(t).
