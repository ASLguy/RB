<p>Like most of her neighbors, Romania mostly depended on importing armored vehicles, and was often reduced to buying hand-me-downs or &quot;refurbished&quot; vehicles that were no longer of use to their original owner (mostly Germany). Russian vehicles (and ordnance) captured during the beginning of Operation Barbarossa were frequently pressed into service. This ex-Russian equipment was then reacquired by Russia when Romania joined the Allies in August 1944.</p>

R-1(t):</span> In 1936 Czechoslovakia began production of the AH-IV Lehky Tank (Light Tank), armed with a turret-mounted 7.92mm ZB vz 35 HMG and a 7.92mm ZB vz 26 LMG mounted on the starboard side of the hull. In June 1937 Romania purchased all 35 of the tankettes then in existence, designating them the R-1. These 35 were the only R-1s made, as production was first delayed by the German takeover and eventually abandoned. The R-1 equipped the elite 1st Royal Cavalry Division. Additionally, the Mechanized Reconnaissance Squadrons of the 1st, 7th, and 9th Cavalry Brigades (still primarily horsed) each included two platoons of two R-1s; while the Mechanized Cavalry Squadrons of the Motorized Regiments of the 5th, 6th, and 8th Cavalry Brigades had two platoons each of three R-1s.</p>
<p>†RF is 1.4 for 39-42; 1.5 thereafter.</p>
<p>†Due to its hull-side mounting the R-1's BMG may only fire through the vehicle's starboard front VCA, (as signified by &quot;BMG=SVCA only&quot;). See accompanying diagram.</p>

R-35/45(f):</span> In late December 1942, the Romanian Army began rearming its remaining French-built R-35s (see <a href="chh_axisminornotes_chhaxisminorvehiclenotes.htm#32" class="topiclink">Common Vehicle Note 32</a>) with the 45mm gun found in captured Soviet BT-7 and T-26 tanks. Unfortunately, the 45mm rounds took up much more space than the 37mm shells did and far fewer of them could be carried. Combined with the larger gun, this required the removal of the CMG. By June 1944 all 30 upgrades were completed and these tank destroyers —re-designated Vanatorul de Care R-35 (Transformat) — were assigned to the 2nd Armored Regiment. It is probable that two R-35 squadrons serving in the 3rd Army in August 1944 were equipped with the VDC P-35 Transformat tank destroyer. In February 1945 two companies of tank destroyers and the remaining unreconstructed R-35s formed part of the 2nd Armored Regiment during its campaign in Czechoslovakia and Austria. By the end of the war not a single VDC P-35 Transformat remained serviceable.</p>

TACAM T-60(r) &amp; T-60A(r):</span> In an effort to combat the Russian T-34, Lt. Colonel Constantin Ghiulai in late 1942 brought together captured Russian tanks and captured Russian field guns. T-60 and T-60A light tanks were chosen due to their simple construction and high maneuverability, and the weapon to be mounted was the Soviet M1936 76.2mm field gun. Conversion of 34 vehicles began in November 1942. They were designated Pun AntiCar cu Afet Mobil T-60 (anti-tank gun with mobile carriage) or TACAM T-60 and T-60A. The turret was replaced with an open-backed, three-sided fighting compartment and the engine, suspension, and wheels were modified. By the end of 1943, the 34 completed TACAM T-60s were assigned to the reforming 1st Armored Division: 16 to the 1st Armored Regiment in the 61st TACAM Company and 18 to the 2nd Armored Regiment in the 62nd TACAM Company. The vehicle also saw service with the 8th Motorized Cavalry Division in 1944. Most TACAM T-60s survived combat and were reclaimed by the Soviets in October 1944.</p>

As in the TACAM T-60, the fighting compartment was an open-backed, three-sided gun shield, but it also had a small roof portion in the front. After many delays, 20 TACAM R-2s were completed by the end of June 1944, when plans were changed to further up-gun the tank destroyer either with Romania's own Resita 1943 75mm gun or with the German &quot;88,&quot; or to add a flamethrower instead. All such plans were shelved, however, with Romania's defection in August. The TACAM R-2s were organized into the 63rd TACAM Company in three platoons of three TDs each, with a Battery HQ consisting of an armored reconnaissance car, a command car, and one TACAM R-2. They entered service with the 1st Training Armored Division in late July 1944 and were used during the liberation of Bucharest, Ploesti, and Northern Transylvania through October 1944, during which ten were lost. In November the remaining ten were issued to the 2nd Armored Regiment, which used them during its campaign in Moravia and Austria in 1945.</p>

By late 1942 there were enough, together with a small number of scout cars purchased from Germany, to establish an armored car company within the 1st Armored Division. Despite their simple design, a shortage of spare parts forced most to be withdrawn from service after less than a year of operation.</p>

This was a licensed version of the Renault Chenillette a&quot; Infanterie Type UE (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#28" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 28</a>) and was intended for towing the 47mm gun in the anti-tank companies and for transporting munitions and fuel in the motorized cavalry regiments. Production could not be continued, however, as French imports dried up. After the invasion of France, Germany provided around 50 more carriers. Many of the UE2s were lost at Stalingrad. The remaining vehicles were adapted in early 1944 to tow the German 5cm anti-tank gun, after which they were distributed to different divisions on the Moldavian front. Most of these were confiscated by the Soviets after August 1944.</p>

<p>Hungary joined the invasion of Russia with more AFV of indigenous design than any of the other minor nations. For the invasion, Hungary could field a total of 189 tanks, tankettes (from Italy), and armored cars. Most of these quickly proved obsolete, and Hungary increasingly turned to Germany for more tanks. Hungary also attempted to produce its own &quot;Panther&quot; tanks under license, but this project was dropped due to the excessively high price charged by the Germans. By 1944, Allied bombers had succeeded in reducing most Hungarian factories to rubble, and by 1945 all AFV production had ceased.</p>

Then after being armed locally and tested during 1938, it was designated the 38M Toldi. (Toldi was the name of a legendary Magyar fourteenth century warrior.) It was armed with the 20mm 36M AT rifle (the Swiss Solothurn built under license) and an 8mm Gebauer 34/37 MG installed in the turret. This MG could, if required, be placed on a special support on the turret roof for AA use. A total of 80 tanks were built, with 6 assigned per company in each armored brigade (increasing to 23 per brigade in 1941). Each brigade was to have three companies equipped with Toldis and one company equipped with Turans, but due to delays in the delivery of the Turans each brigade was instead equipped with four companies of Toldis. These tanks were used in battle for the first time during the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, with some 54 Toldis belonging to the 1st Motorized Brigade (9th Armored Battalion), the 2nd Motorized Brigade (11th Armored Battalion), and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade (1st Armored Cavalry Battalion). For the attack on the Soviet Union, however, one company of each battalion was held in reserve. Its engine proved to be the Achilles heel of the Toldi, and more tanks were lost to operating problems than enemy fire. This counter represents both the Toldi I and early versions of the Toldi II, the only difference being a slight reconfiguration in the armor and the fact that the Toldi II was built entirely in Hungary.</p>

About 80 of the versions I &amp; II were up-gunned with the 40mm 42M L/25 gun and dubbed the Toldi IIA. The 40mm gun, built by MAVAG, was a shortened version of the 41M L/51 fitted to the Turan I.</p>

A licensing agreement was signed in August 1940 for production to begin in Hungary. Before production began, the tank was modified from the original Czech design in a number of ways. A 260 HP V-8 engine designed by Manfred Weisz and a 3-man turret were installed. The Turan I armament was based on the Hungarian 40mm 41M anti-tank gun. This weapon in turn was derived from the German PaK 35/36 but used the tubes of the Bofors 40mm and the same ammunition as the 40mm 37M Bofors AA gun which was also made by MAVAG. The Turan I carried 100 rounds of 40mm ammunition and mounted two 8mm 34/40 air-cooled, belt fed tank MG derived from the Czech Brno Z830. Beginning in October 1941, almost 290 40M were built at 4 different factories before the war brought production to a halt in 1944. These tanks equipped the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division in 1942-43. Some Turan Is were fitted with Schuerzen late in 1944. The Turan was named after a legendary Asian people said to have been ancestors of the Hungarians.</p>

The 41M was built on the Turan I chassis and armed with the 75mm 41M L/25. It was originally designated 41M Turan II heavy tank, but that was changed in 1944 to 41M Turan &quot;75 short&quot; heavy tank. The first of about 139 41M were delivered in May 1943 and the remainder shipped in October of the same year. The first tanks were allocated to the 2nd Armored Division and the 1st Cavalry Division, with some going to the newly formed Assault Artillery Battalion. The 1st Armored Division eventually received its share of Turan lis later in the war. Some Turan lis were fitted with Schuerzen late in 1944.</p>

They were assigned to the 1st Company of the 3/1 Tank Battalion. Only two Panthers from this unit were still in service by October 1944. An additional 12 Panthers may have been diverted to Hungary after Romania switched sides.</p>
<p>†Each time this AFV expends one MP to start, its owner must make a DR; if a 12 is rolled the AFV has stalled and has not actually begun to move. The owner must then make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to stop, but excluding the one MP to start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It can again attempt to move, but must expend a MP to start—and must undergo another Stall DR as it does so. If the owning player forgets to make his Stall DR, the opposing player can thereafter call for it to be made at any time during that same MPh as the AFV expends any MP. An AFV that stalls is subject to Defensive First Fire (since it expended a MP to start), but not as a moving target unless it had already entered a new hex during the MPh. Should a Stall result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, the AFV is considered to have expended its entire MP allotment in Delay.</p>

A mobile assault gun mounted on the Turan chassis and armed with a 75mm anti-tank gun, the Zrinyi I prototype was finished in December 1942. However, due to a severe shortage of these guns, production models were fitted with the 105mm 40/43M howitzer, a modified version of the MAVAG 105mm 40M towed field howitzer. Production began under the name 43M Zrinyi II assault howitzer, a name later changed to 43M Zrinyi &quot;105&quot; assault howitzer. The name &quot;Zrinyi&quot; comes from Nikolaus Graf Zrinyi, a Hungarian hero who fought the Turks and was killed in the battle of Szigetvar in 1566. Only 60 were built before production was halted when American bombers destroyed the main assembly building on July 27, 1944. The first five Zrinyis were assigned in August 1943 to the 1st Assault Artillery Battalion and saw combat in July 1944 at Ottynia in eastern Galicia. Most of the remaining Zrinyis were split between the 1st and 10th Assault Artillery Battalions, while the other artillery battalions were equipped with StuG IIIs and Hetzers and received only two Zrinyi IIs each for training purposes. Some of these latter vehicles were collected and sent to the 25th &quot;Kolozsvari&quot; Group in September 1944 and took part in the fighting near Torda in southern Transylvania. During this group's retreat all its Zrinyis were destroyed owing to lack of fuel. The remaining Zrinyis were diverted to one or two batteries of the 20th and 24th Groups. The 10th Assault Artillery Battalion also fought at the battle of Torda and later saw action in Hungary proper. In the latter part of 1944 most Zrinyi IIs were fitted with Schuerzen.</p>

He came to an agreement about producing some of his designs for his home country and with the assistance of the Hungarian Institute for Military Technology, the 39M Csaba armored scout car came into being as an enhanced version of his British designs. The prototype of the 39M Csaba was completed in June 1939, but the first run of 61 units was not delivered until August 1940. A second run of 70 vehicles was ordered in June 1941 and completed shortly thereafter. The 39M mounted a 20mm gun and an 8mm MG in the turret. Production of the 40M command car began in 1940, with a total of 70 being completed by 1944. These differed from the 39M by mounting a large grid type aerial and a smaller turret with only one MG but with two radios. The two vehicles formed reconnaissance companies (ten 39Ms and one 40M command vehicle). Almost 90% of these Csabas on hand for Barbarossa had already been lost by the end of July 1941. The 30th Regiment of the 1st Armored Division had 18 Csabas on hand in 1942. German units appropriated for combat use whatever Csabas they could find during their retreat in 1945. Csaba (pronounced &quot;Chah-bah&quot;) was the name of Attila the Hun's youngest son.</p>

The Hungarians received the first vehicle in December of 1937 and started production of their own version with a widened turret to mount the MAVAG version of the 40mm Bofors in February of 1939. The vehicle was designated armored machine-gun vehicle 40M Nimrod and 135 were produced between 1941 and 1944 when production ceased as a result of the German occupation of Budapest. The Nimrod was very similar to the Toldi (which was derived from the Swedish L60 from which descended the LVKV 40). The open-topped superstructure was roomy and the unique gun mantlet allowed for maximum elevation and traverse of the Bofors gun. The first 18 Nimrods were assigned to the 51st Armored Machine Gun Battalion (better known as the 51st Tank Hunter Battalion) in May of 1942 as part of the 1st Armored Field Division that was overwhelmed by heavy Soviet attacks in January 1943. In late March of 1943 there were only three Nimrods left. Between May 1943 and the spring of 1944, new Nimrods equipped the re-formed 1st Armored Division (1st Tank Hunter Battalion with three batteries for a total of 18 tanks) and the 2nd Armored Division (15th Motorcycle Battalion equipped with a battery of Nimrods, the 52nd Tank Hunter Battalion, and five autonomous platoons of four Nimrods each). The two armored divisions had 38 Nimrods each in September of 1944. The 1st Cavalry Division had four Nimrods in September of 1944 when it was renamed the 1st Hussar Division &quot;for its gallant actions in Poland.&quot;</p>

<p>The Pilfousek Fast Brigade under the command of Rudolf Pilfousek was composed of part of the former Czechoslovakian 3rd Fast Division, which had left 79 PzKpfw 35(t) tanks in the Levice area. The brigade was merged with the 1st Slovakian Division in August 1941 to form the Slovakian Fast Division. This division was part of the German 17th Army that fought at Lvov and Kiev. It was nearly destroyed by the Soviet counter attacks at Stalingrad, after which it was withdrawn from active fighting. Beginning in 1943 the Germans began exporting significant numbers of AFV to Slovakia as replacements.</p>

It went into production in 1932 and the army received 70 of them in 1933. The T vz 33 was built along the lines of the Polish TKS tankettes, both being derived from the Carden-Lloyd. It was armed with two 7.92mm ZB (Ceska Zbrojovka Brno) vz 26 machine guns. For the invasion of Poland the Slovaks used these tankettes as part of a small mobile force. Following the Polish Campaign, the Germans gave Slovakia an additional 30 T vz 33 tankettes that were later integrated into the Slovakian Fast division.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the Croatian military was plagued by a lack of equipment and weapons, especially heavy weapons and armor. Armored units were few, and they had no tanks, only a few tankettes and armored cars. Until 1943, the most important mechanized formation in the Croatian army was the unit led by Ustashe Colonel Ante Moskov. This force was composed of a sharpshooter battalion and a mechanized battalion. The mechanized battalion had ten Italian CV33/35 tankettes. In order to assist the Croats in upgrading their equipment, the Germans provided them with a number of more modern AFV. Shipments began in late 1943 and included various seized Italian vehicles, and approximately 25 PzKpfw IIILs. By late 1944 the Germans had also sent small numbers of PzKpfw IVGs, PzKpfw IVF1s, and SdKfz-251 armored halftracks. Two dozen IIILs were given to the Ustashi and used to form an armored division containing a mobile battalion with two tank companies and a mechanized battalion with one.</p>
<p><a id="24"></a><img src="axmiv054.jpg" width="195" height="190" alt="AxMiV054" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">24. TKS &amp; TKS(L):</span> These Polish tankettes (<a href="chh_alliedminornotes_chhalliedminorvehiclenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">Allied Minor Vehicle Note 1</a>) were transferred from the Germans after the invasion of Poland, and most were used by the Redarstevna Straza or National Police Force that was tasked with suppressing dissension within the country. In June 1942 this force was made part of the Ustashe force and a year later it was transferred into the National Army. Some formed the 1-4 Battalion of the Zagreb Garrison Brigade. The Croats equipped them with the German MG 34.</p>
<p>†Most of the TKS series of tankettes were in poor mechanical condition; a short track life and lack of spare parts were always a problem. Therefore, each time a Mechanical Reliability DR is made for a TKS or TKS(L), an 11 indicates that the AFV has stalled or suffered some other mechanical problem that has prevented it from starting normally. Its owner must then immediately make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to stop, but excluding the MP expended to start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It can again attempt to move, but must expend another MP to start—and must undergo another Mechanical Reliability DR as it does so. Should the Stall result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, the AFV is considered to have expended its entire MP in Delay. This is signified by &quot;12: Immob 11: Stall&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†A MG Scrounged from the TKS (or its wreck) takes the form of an Axis Minor-colored LMG(g).</p>

<p>No combatant nation was more unprepared for war than Bulgaria, which had little more than 60 AFV in 1938, including perhaps 8 obsolete tanks of British design and 14 Italian tankettes. Military opinion had deemed the mountainous terrain unsuitable for armored vehicles. By 1942, the Germans and Bulgarians still considered her armored forces insufficient even for self-defense. During 1943 and the first part of 1944 Germany provided almost 100 PzKpfw IV models G and H, together with various assault guns, armored cars, and ex-French tanks. After intensive training in the spring and summer of 1944 the formations given this equipment were ready for combat in good time to fight their German trainers after Bulgaria changed sides. The Armored Regiment at that time consisted of three battalions of three companies, plus a headquarters company, a reserve platoon, and two training companies. Each battalion had two companies of PzKpfw IV tanks, while the third company had either Pz38(t) or Pz35(t) tanks (<a href="chh_axisminornotes_chhaxisminorvehiclenotes.htm#39" class="topiclink">Common Vehicle Notes 39</a>, <a href="chh_axisminornotes_chhaxisminorvehiclenotes.htm#35" class="topiclink">35</a>, &amp; <a href="chh_axisminornotes_chhaxisminorvehiclenotes.htm#34" class="topiclink">34</a>). After losses suffered during the 1944-1945 winter, the Bulgarian tank force was reduced to an Armored Battalion that saw action in Hungary in the spring. Some StuG assault guns were organized into separate Assault Gun Battalions. The Russians provided their new ally with small numbers of various captured Axis vehicles, as well as 65 T-34/85s in mid-March 1945.</p>

<p>When the Germans had no more use for a fighting vehicle, they were happy to sell it to their allies. Most of the vehicles listed below fall into this category, including many of those produced in France or Italy. A few were obtained directly from the country of origin. A few were even provided by Germany despite still being of potential use, although this &quot;largesse&quot; ceased as the war progressed and shortages in Germany arose. After Romania and Bulgaria switched sides in the latter part of 1944, Russia started supplying them with some captured German vehicles.</p>

In June 1941 the Germans sent 40 R-35s to Bulgaria where they made up the 2nd Armored Battalion in the 1st Tank Regiment. These vehicles were all in very poor mechanical condition with many essential components missing (this was attributed to French sabotage before the vehicles were shipped out of France). &nbsp;Hungary seized three Polish R-35s in 1939 after they fled Poland.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for Romania are 1.5 for 39-40, 1.3 for 1941, and 1.5 for 42-45; for Bulgaria and Hungary are 1.6 for 41-45.</p>

In 1937 Romania ordered 126 of these tanks from Czechoslovakia requiring modifications to the rear hull and turret of the Czech model. Germany sold 26 of their captured stock to Romania in 1942 to replace the R-2s lost in 1941. By August 1942 there were 87 of these tanks still in the Romanian inventory with the majority serving in Cavalry Divisions. †RF is 1.2 for 39-45.</p>
<p>Bulgaria received 26 tanks from Germany between February and April 1940. Ten more came at the end of the year directly from Skoda (having been built for Afghanistan). The Bulgarians designated this tank the T-11. They eventually used it against the Germans during the fighting in the mountains of Yugoslavia where these light and highly mobile tanks were very successful, although many were immobilized by a lack of spare parts. The remaining tanks were incorporated into the tank brigade of the 1st Bulgarian Army for its drive into Austria. †RF is 1.4 for 41-45.</p>
<p>Slovakia inherited 79 from the former Czechoslovakian 3rd Fast Division, incorporating them into the Pilfousek Fast Brigade and then the Slovakian Fast Division. These continued in service through 1944 when many fought during the uprising. †RF is 1.3 for 39-8/44.</p>

The 38(t)A represents models A-D &amp; S, while the 38(t)E represents the up-armored models E-G. &nbsp;In spring 1943 Romania received from Germany 50 early models that required significant refurbishing. Germany insisted that these be sent to the Russian Front, so most ended up with the 2nd Armored Regiment of the 1st Armored Division. The Romanians called these tanks the T-38. †RF for 38(t)A is 1.5 for 3/43-8/44 and 1.6 for 9/44-45.</p>
<p>Hungary bought 108 models D-G from Germany between April and May 1942 in order to cover the delay in production of the new Turan medium tanks. Of these, 38 were command vehicles and 70 were regular tanks, but the only difference was in the type of radio. The hull MG was often appropriated for other purposes. These tanks were part of the 1st Hungarian Armored Division and all but six were destroyed at the Don near Stalingrad. †RF for 38(t)A is 1.5 for 6/42-45; RF for 38(t)E is 1.3 for 6/42-12/42 and 1.5 thereafter.</p>

<p>The Ausf S model was similar to the older models A, B, and C; 92 were built between May and September of 1941 for Sweden but were then re-worked for German use. Germany then gave 37 of these to Slovakia, which already had 74 models A and G. Slovakia's last LT vz 38s were destroyed during the Slovakian uprising of 1944. The 38(t)A counters also represent an up-gunned version of the LT vz 40. Slovakia had 21 of these vehicles and used them in the Fast Division after 1941 (where most were lost at Stalingrad) or in the Security Division between August 1942 and April 1943. †RF for 38(t)A is 1.3 for 39-12/42; 1.4 for 1/43-8/43; and 1.6 for 9/43-8/44; RF for 38(t)E is 1.6 for 42-8/44.</p>
