Mortars:</span> The &quot;Ordnance, Muzzle Loading, 2-in. Mortar&quot; was derived from a Spanish design. The threatening international situation forced it into production in 1938 after only a minimum of testing, but nonetheless it performed well throughout WW2. Its short range was a drawback, but one at least partially offset by its ability to fire smoke, and later, IR. One 2-in. mortar was allotted to the HQ of each infantry (including parachute and airlanding) platoon, each motor platoon, each assault troop in an infantry recce squadron, and each support troop in an AC squadron. In the latter half of 1943, each gun troop in an AT regiment was authorized two 2-in. mortars (those in a 17pdr troop, whether SP or towed, were carried in trucks; see also <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#66" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 66</a>). There were 14 variations of the 2-in. mortar, the most noteworthy being the Airborne version which was lighter and had a shorter barrel; it was issued to parachute infantry.</p>

Mortar:</span> The Stokes 3-in. trench mortar which entered service in 1917 was the forerunner of the modern infantry mortar. By 1939 the Mk II version was in widespread service, but lacked range compared to its Axis counterparts. Improved ammunition and, later, improvements to the mortar itself partially redressed this problem. In 1940 an infantry battalion contained only two 3-in. mortars, but in 1941 this was increased to a platoon of six. Also in 1941, two were added to the infantry division's recce battalion, and in 1942 this too was increased to a platoon of six. Some motor battalions began the war with two 3-in. mortars per company, but others apparently had none until 1942. An airlanding (glider) battalion in 1944 had a platoon of four 3-in. mortars, plus two more 3-in. in each of the battalion's four companies; at the start of 1945 all were placed at battalion level in three four-mortar platoons. In India-Burma the 3-in. saw even more widespread service: Light Mountain, and Jungle Field, artillery regiments were given a battery of sixteen 3-in. in 1943, and in 1944 AT and AA/AT regiments also received them. In Burma, each Chindit company was authorized two 3-in. mortars.</p>
<p>†The mortar's range is 6-36 initially, but changes to 3-63 in September 1942 as signified by &quot;[3-63]<span class="f_Exponent">S2+</span>&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for non-PTO use are 4/40-3/41 (1.3), 4-10/41 (1.2) [EXC: 1.3 for 5/41 use on Crete], and 11/41-5/45 (1.1). For PTO use they are 12/41-10/42 (1.3), 11/42-11/43 (1.1), 12/43-10/44 (1.0), and 11/44-45 (.9).</p>

Mortar:</span> This mortar was developed in 1941 to fire chemical rounds, but HE ammo was designed for it as the fighting in North Africa made it clear that a mortar with a range greater than that of the 3-in. was needed. Like the 3-in., the 4.2-in. initially had an unsatisfactory range for a mortar of its caliber, being able to reach out only to about 3100m; improved ammo soon appeared, which increased its range to some 3900m. In North Africa it was used by Royal Engineer mortar companies. In the ETO it was assigned directly to infantry units: an infantry division's MG/support battalion had a company of sixteen, of which four (one platoon) were in the support company detached from that battalion to each brigade; in an armoured division, the independent MG company attached to the infantry brigade also contained one such platoon. In the PTO the 4.2-in. first appeared in 1944, replacing the 3-in. mortars in AT regiments (except in the West African divisions). More arrived during the advance to Rangoon, and were allotted to divisional artillery regiments. The 4.2-in. was usually towed by a Loyd Carrier. One battery of 4.2-in. accompanied the 29th Brigade to Korea in 1950.</p>
<p>†The 4.2-in. is towed by a vehicle—not carried in it like other 107mm mortars (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a> and footnote <a href="chc_chcfootnotes.htm#26" class="topiclink">C26</a>)—as signified by &quot;Towed&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for non-PTO use are 10/42-1/43 (1.6), 2-3/43 (1.5), 4-6/43 (1.4), and 7/43-5/45 (1.3). For PTO use they are 5-9/44 (1.5), 10/44-1/45 (1.3), and 2-8/45 (1.2).</p>

The British purchased a quantity in 1938, and used them in nine-gun AT companies allotted to infantry brigades. At least one AT regiment in the BEF (the 14th, of the 4th Infantry Division) was also equipped with them. A number saw action in Norway, but the majority were used (and lost) in Belgium and France. Later, some were used in North Africa by Free French troops who had captured them in Syria. In Europe the BEF found the 25mm too flimsy to be towed, so they began transporting them in the back of trucks. This method of carrying AT guns en portee later became widespread in the British Army.</p>
<p>†ETO Dates and RF are 4/40 (1.3) and 5-6/40 (1.2). For North African use they are 1-6/42 (1.5).</p>

However, the loss of 509 2pdrs in France virtually eliminated the Army's stock of AT guns, and forced the British to give 2pdr production top priority for another year (thus delaying the development of the 6pdr). In the early desert fighting the 2pdr was entirely adequate, but as the Panzers acquired thicker armor it became less and less able to deal with them. Moreover, when the Germans would locate the position of a 2pdr, if possible they stood their Pz IV off beyond its effective range and leisurely shelled it into submission. By 1942 it was dangerously obsolete— but even so, it fought on until the fall of Tunis. Its usual transport in the desert was the 2pdr Portee (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#77" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 77</a>). In the PTO the 2pdr remained in use throughout the war, though by the end of 1943 in India-Burma it was officially authorized only in the AA/AT regiment of light divisions.</p>
<p>2pdrs were used in AT regiments with four guns per troop, and from early 1942 began appearing in infantry and motor battalions in two or four four-gun platoons respectively. The AT troop of infantry recce regiments that fought in North Africa from late 1942 had six 2pdrs; later these were exchanged for 6pdrs. As a sidenote, HE did exist for the 2pdr, but was rather ineffective and apparently not widely issued. As with many other British guns, the 2pdr was named for the weight of the projectile it fired. &quot;OQF&quot; stands for &quot;Ordnance, Quick Firing&quot;, which indicated that the projectile and propellant charge were loaded as a single unit.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for ETO use are 5-6/40 (Belgium and France; 1.2), 4/41 (Greece; 1.2), and 5/41 (Crete; 1.5). For use in Africa they are 6/40-4/41 (1.3), 5/41-3/42 (1.2), 4-6/42 (1.1), 7-12/42 (1.0), and 1-5/43 (.9). For PTO use they are 12/41-2/42 (1.3), 3-6/42 (1.5), 7-8/42 (1.4), 9-10/42 (1.3), 11/42-11/43 (1.2), and 12/43-45 (1.3).</p>

OQF 6-Pounder:</span> This gun was designed in 1938 but, due to the immediate and pressing need for 2pdrs after the fall of France, it was late 1941 before any could be produced even for testing. It was being issued to motor battalions in North Africa just as the Gazala battles commenced in May 1942, but did not have much impact at that time due to its new owners' lack of training with it. AT regiments began receiving it shortly afterward, and used it in four-gun troops. By the second battle of Alamein, three-fourths (on average) of the AT guns in an infantry division's AT regiment, and all the AT guns in an armoured division, were 6pdrs (though in the latter some were Deacon SP guns). AT regiments in North Africa also received some Lend-Lease U.S. 57mm AT guns in late 1942 and early 1943. Infantry battalions began exchanging their 2pdrs for 6pdrs in early 1943, and at the end of the North African campaign infantry battalions destined for the ETO were authorized a platoon of six 6pdrs in their support company. In North Africa, a motor battalion equipped with 6pdrs had sixteen (four platoons) such guns, but by 1944 in the ETO this had been reduced to three platoons. In 1944, airlanding battalions had two six-gun 6pdr platoons; in early 1945 each troop was reduced to four guns. In the PTO, 6pdrs apparently were used only in AT regiments. Prior to the invasion of Italy in 1943, 6pdrs were carried en portee; afterwards they were towed—usually by Loyd Carriers. Small numbers of 6pdrs are still in service in a few countries.</p>

OQF 17/25-Pounder:</span> In the autumn of 1942, British Army Intelligence began to suspect that the new German Tiger tank might soon appear in North Africa. The 17pdr AT was in production at this time but, due to numerous delays, no carriages had yet been completed. In an attempt to get the gun into action quickly, one was rigged onto a 25pdr carriage and test-fired. The carriage was just able to handle the powerful recoil force; and the combination, deemed an acceptable stopgap, was designated the 17/25pdr. Under the codename &quot;Pheasant&quot; (which soon became the gun's nickname), 100 barrel and breech assemblies were hurriedly flown to North Africa where they were mounted on spare 25pdr carriages. Pheasants were used by AT regiments in four-gun troops, first going into action at the battle of Medenine. As standard 17pdrs became available, the 17/25pdrs were withdrawn.</p>

AT to replace the 6pdr was issued in early 1941, and the resulting weapon entered production in mid 1942. It began equipping AT regiments In mid 1943, and in action proved to be one of the very best AT guns of WW2—a fine compromise between weight and hitting power. A troop comprised four guns. Modified versions of the 17pdr were mounted in the Sherman Firefly and Challenger tanks, and in the Achilles and Archer TD. A few countries still employ the 17pdr.</p>

In British service its use was confined mainly to the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. The artillery complement of each was an airlanding light regiment which contained 27 pack howitzers in three-gun troops. In the PTO the Australians used a small number of pack howitzers late in the war. The British also supplied some to the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chinese Army.</p>

Afterwards they remained in widespread service with British and Commonwealth forces, many (but not all) being modified for vehicular towing in the 1930s. In France and Belgium, 18pdrs (along with 4.5-in. howitzers) were used as divisional artillery in some BEF units; in the hasty retreats and evacuations 216 were left behind. In Africa they were used in the same role until replaced by 25pdrs, and then were put to use as AT guns (mostly, it seems, in Commonwealth units). In the PTO they saw action in many areas including Malaya, Hong Kong, Burma (sometimes in the AT role), and New Guinea. In both artillery and AT use, an 18pdr troop comprised four guns. †Dates and RF for use in Belgium and France are 5-6/40 (1.4). For Africa [EXC: NA in Madagascar] they are 6/40-4/41 (1.3), 5-10/41 (1.2), 11/41-6/42 (1.3), 7/42 (1.4), 8-9/42 (1.5), and 10-12/42 (1.6). For PTO use they are 12/41 (1.4), 1-2/42 (1.3), 3-7/42 (1.4), and 8-12/42 (1.5).</p>

OQF 25-Pounder Short:</span> The Australians found the 25pdr difficult to move in the arduous terrain of New Guinea, so they developed their own version, concentrating on making it smaller and lighter wherever possible. The new gun bore little resemblance to the original, and could be disassembled into 14 parts for animal-pack transport—though it was usually towed by a Jeep. The &quot;Baby 25pdr&quot;, as it was nicknamed, was not an unqualified success, however; its range, rate of fire and reliability were all less than that of the standard 25pdr. A production run of 212 was completed. It was used only in the PTO, and apparently only by the Australians.</p>

Earlier that year, however, the process of replacing the barrel liners of late-model ISpdrs with new liners of 87.6mm caliber had begun. Well over a thousand were so converted, and it was these guns—designated 25pdr Mk I (but more commonly referred to as 18/25pdrs)—which equipped most of the BEF field regiments in France (where 704 of the Mk I were lost). The Mk I was also used in Africa, but apparently not in the PTO. In game terms it is equivalent to the true 25pdr (the Mk II) except for having a maximum range of 275 hexes.</p>
<p>The 25pdr Mk II first saw action in Norway, but was not used again in the ETO until 1941. It first appeared in Africa in early 1941. In North Africa, the need for a gun more potent than the 2pdr resulted in 25pdr regiments being split up more and more often as the campaign progressed, with individual troops and batteries parceled out to various units and mobile columns. While the 25pdr performed well as an AT gun (with its unique circular firing platform an important aspect of this capability), such use seriously impaired the artillery's ability to provide concentrated fire when needed. It was only when 6pdrs became available that the 25pdrs were able to fully revert to their traditional role.</p>
<p>Once in full production, the 25pdr equipped field regiments in every theater, becoming the standard—and sole—artillery piece in non-PTO infantry divisions. Four guns made up a troop. Well over 12,000 of the Mk II were produced in Britain, plus 1,527 in Australia and many more in Canada. The Afrika Korps used a substantial number of captured pieces, and in the ETO 25pdrs were issued to a few U.S. artillery battalions. 25pdrs saw action in Korea, and remained in first-line British service until 1967. More than a dozen countries still have 25pdrs in their artillery arsenals.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for ETO use are 5/40 (Norway; 1.6), 5-6/40 (Belgium and France; 1.3), 4/41 (Greece; 1.3), 5/41 (Crete; 1.6), and 7/43-5/45 (1.3). For Africa they are 6/40-2/41 (1.5), 3-4/41 (1.4), 5-10/41 (1.3), 11/41-12/42 (1.2) [EXC: NA in Madagascar], and 1-5/43 (1.3).

Howitzer: </span>This was a pack howitzer designed for the Indian Army. It was also referred to as a &quot;Screw Gun&quot; since the barrel and breech were separate sections, joined together by being screwed into the opposite ends of a special junction nut. It was well liked by its users despite having a fairly short range. The great majority were used in India-Burma, where they formed a portion (in a few cases all) of a division's artillery. In addition, small numbers of Independent Light Batteries saw action practically everywhere that British troops fought, including Norway, Crete, North Africa, Madagascar, Sicily, Italy, New Guinea and the Scheldt estuary. The 3.7-in. pack howitzer was used in four-gun batteries in Mountain and Light Mountain artillery regiments, and in eight-gun batteries in Jungle field regiments. Independent Light Batteries could contain either six or eight guns.</p>

During the 1930s the substantial number still in service were modified for vehicular towing even though their short range had already rendered them obsolescent. In 1940 they formed part of the artillery complement in certain BEF divisions, and 96 were left behind in the evacuations.

Gun-Howitzer:</span> These guns, termed medium artillery, used the same carriage and were nearly identical in appearance. They were employed in medium regiments, which usually comprised one battery (eight guns) of each type with four guns per troop. (Medium regiments were corps-level units; generally, in the ETO, one was assigned to support each division.) Although the &quot;Four-Five&quot; was fondly referred to as the &quot;long-range sniper&quot;, for its size and weight it fired a rather small-caliber projectile with low HE content; consequently, around 1944 it began to be phased out. The &quot;Five-Five&quot;, on the other hand, performed well (after some initial problems), and in 1988 remains in service in some half-dozen countries. &quot;OBL&quot; stands for &quot;Ordnance, Breech Loading&quot;, which indicated that the projectile and propellant charge were loaded separately.</p>

Howitzer:</span> A sturdy and reliable piece which dated back to WW1 (during which some 4,000 were built), the 6-in. howitzer formed the backbone of British medium artillery in the interwar years. In 1940, most of the 221 sent to France with the BEF fell into Gerzman hands. In Africa the 6-in. remained in combat service (and was supplemented by a number of U.S. M1918 155mm howiters) until replaced by the 4.5-in. and 5.5-in. In the PTO it saw action during the Japanese conquest of Malaya, but after that was apparently not used again until relatively late in the war when it equipped some medium regiments in India-Burma.</p>

Howitzer Mk I:</span> In July 1940 it was decided that the existing WW1 8-in. howitzers, including some of similar design recently purchased from the U.S., would be upgraded by exchanging their barrel liners for new ones of 7.2-in. caliber, thus increasing their range. These, in their various forms, became the 7.2-in. howitzer Mks I-IV. Unfortunately, the weapon's recoil was now too much for the carriage: each time the gun fired it leapt backwards. To control this, ramps were supplied for placement behind the wheels. When fired, the gun rolled up (and ideally not over) the ramps, then back down again to be stopped by chocks; the gun then had to be re-aimed for its next shot. Occasionally the gun rolled completely over the ramps, effectively putting it out of action until manhandled back into position. 7.2-in. howitzers formed the standard equipment of heavy regiments (though from the latter half of 1943 some of these regiments, which were Army-level units, were equipped instead with U.S. 155mm &quot;Long Toms&quot;). From late 1944, each corps engaged in Burma was allotted one battery of four 7.2-in. howitzers.</p>

Howitzer Mk VI:</span> When the U.S. M1A1 155mm &quot;Long Tom&quot; became available to the British, they studied the feasibility of utilizing its carriage for the 7.2-in. howitzer. Since the carriage had been designed to also accommodate the U.S. 8-in. howitzer (which used the same barrel as the 7.2-in.), the conversion was fairly simple. However, at this point the British decided to design a longer 7.2-in. barrel instead of using the old type. This version, the new barrel on the U.S. carriage, was designated the Mk VI. As it became available it replaced the previous Marks in heavy regiments, and served on for many years after the war.</p>

The latter was the preferred type but, being the last into production, was never available in sufficient quantity to replace the others. The 20mm was authorized in a wide variety of units including artillery and AT regiments, the brigade HQs and recce squadrons of airborne divisions, and engineer field squadrons; however, due to production delays and problems with the ammunition, not many actually saw action with Army forces. The difficulty with the ammunition was that, unlike the normal design of AA rounds, the HE projectile did not self-destruct after a set number of seconds in flight, and thus could fall to earth amidst friendly troops and cause casualties. For this reason many commanders declined use of the weapon until self-destructing HE could be provided—which did not occur until the spring of 1945. Apparently the only light AA regiments authorized the 20mm were those in NWE, and only through 8/44 (at which time their 20mm troops were abolished). A 20mm troop generally had eight such weapons, in two four-gun sections.</p>

By 1941, British factories were turning them out in quantity, and both Canada and Australia produced them as well. Bofors equipped light A A regiments in all theaters throughout the war. A troop initially comprised four guns, but by 1943 it had been enlarged to six. The Bofors Gun is still employed in well over a dozen armies.</p>

During the interwar years it was modernized in various ways; in 1940, obsolescent but still useful, it formed the mainstay of heavy AA regiments. A wide variety of static and mobile mountings were developed for it; the game piece represents one of the latter types. It was not designed for firing at ground targets; see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhmultibritordnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">British Ordnance Note E</a>. Though the 3.7-in.

By 1940 some 500 were in service, dispersed throughout the Empire. Later Marks incorporated an automatic fuse setter and power rammer for the shells, which doubled the gun's ROF. In the latter half of the war, it was often employed as artillery, using indirect fire. The 3.7-in. is still in the AA arsenals of a few countries.</p>
