<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1930s, the British, who had started the whole idea of tank warfare and formulated many of the theories which the Germans later turned into the Blitzkrieg concept, forsook their lead in tank design and the development of armored forces. Indeed, at the time of the Munich crisis in 1938, Britain possessed not a single modern gun-armed tank. This was the result of several factors: the financial austerities of the times; the innate conservatism of certain powerful individuals in the Army; and the high priority given to the Army's role in policing the Empire (for which only light tanks with MG were required). Even as rearmament began, the schism in tank doctrine caused by disagreement over the tank's true function in combat remained unresolved. Three different roles were seen for tanks: reconnaissance, for which the current light tanks would (in theory) suffice; mobile operations, during which the new class of fast, gun-armed but lightly armored Cruiser tanks would engage in pursuit and exploitation in much the same manner as cavalry had in the past; and infantry support, for which slow but heavily armored tanks were being produced. The manufacture of MG-armed light tanks ended when their poor survivability on the modern battlefield became manifest. However, the dichotomy of Cruiser and Infantry tanks, which caused needless dispersion of effort in design and production, and which complicated supply and tactical coordination, lasted until the war's end.</p>
<p>Many early-war British tank designs suffered from unreliability due to being put into production without adequate testing beforehand. This occurred during the hasty rearmament of the late '30s, and again in the frantic months after Dunkirk when, after the loss of over 700 tanks in France, only a few hundred remained in all of Britain. Another factor affecting British tank design was the country's railway gauge, which limited the maximum permissible width of a tank. This restricted the size of the turret ring, in effect rendering the tank incapable of carrying a large-caliber, high-velocity gun such as the 17pdr. On the positive side, Britain led the way in the development of specialized armor such as DD tanks, bridge-layers, mine-clearing tanks and the multi-purpose AVRE. These vehicles, which collectively were known as &quot;Funnies&quot;, were Britain's major contribution to armored warfare during WW2.</p>
<p>The British built an estimated 33,000 tanks in the 1936-45 period, including some 2,800 produced in Canada and Australia during the war; however, a number of models (amounting to over 5,000 vehicles) never saw action due to their premature obsolescence and/or chronic unreliability. Total British (only) tank production in the years 1940-45 amounted to some 24,800 vehicles. Between 1938 and 1945 the British also built an estimated 46,000 AFV of other types, including the output of Canada, India and and South Africa but excluding tracked Carriers. Of these, about 36,000 were AC, SC, LRC and wheeled Carriers—highlighting the fact that during WW2 the British made far greater use of wheeled AFV than did any other nation. The U.S. Lend-Leased 27,755 tanks and at least 20,000 other AFV to the various &quot;British&quot; forces/countries.</p>
<p>A short glossary is given below to aid those who may be unfamiliar with the British terms used in the Vehicle and Ordnance Notes. Note that the explanations have been intentionally generalized; in many cases exceptions to them do exist, but have been ignored here.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">A#: </span>A War Office ordnance designation assigned to a tank design. (Army) Tank: A term which, when preceding &quot;brigade&quot;, &quot;battalion'', etc., indicated that the unit in question was equipped with Infantry tanks.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">BEF:</span> British Expeditionary Force—the force sent to France subsequent to Britain's declaration of war on Germany.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Brigade:</span> Equivalent to U.S. &quot;regiment&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Cruiser Tank:</span> A tank designed for the pursuit and exploitation role.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">CS:</span> An AFV (usually a tank) carrying a low-velocity gun which fired only HE/smoke, designed for the Close Support of other AFV.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Infantry (&quot;I&quot;) Tank:</span> A tank designed for the support of infantry in the assault.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Recce:</span> Another term for &quot;reconnaissance&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Regiment:</span> This has several meanings. It can refer to a parent administrative (as opposed to combat) entity—e.g., the Durham Light Infantry Regiment, the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Royal Tank Regiment, the Reconnaissance Regiment. However, when used in reference to a specific type of combat unit—e.g., a tank or AA regiment—it is equivalent to the U.S. &quot;battalion&quot;. Its use in the latter sense was largely confined to armored, recon, cavalry, and artillery (including AA and AT) units.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">RTR: </span>Royal Tank Regiment. When preceded by a number (#), read it as &quot;# Battalion of the Royal Tank Regiment&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Section: </span>When used in reference to an infantry unit, it is equivalent to the U.S. &quot;squad&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Squadron: </span>Equivalent to U.S. &quot;company&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">Troop:</span> Equivalent to U.S. &quot;platoon&quot;, except when used in reference to artillery in which case it is equivalent to U.S. &quot;battery&quot;.</p>
<p>[Note: ETO stands for European Theater of Operations, which in game terms comprises Europe and the Mediterranean islands. NWE stands for Northwest Europe, which in game terms comprises France, Germany and the Low Countries. PTO stands for Pacific Theater of Operations, which in game terms equals &quot;vs Japanese''. The term &quot;British'' is used as defined in <a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.4" class="topiclink">A25.4</a> unless noted otherwise—though it does not generally apply to Free French in the ETO, where for the most pan they were organized and equipped like U.S. forces.]</p>

Light Tank Mk VIB &amp; Mk VIC:</span> The Mark VI series formed the bulk of British armored strength in 1939-40. Although intended for colonial duties and as recon vehicles, they were often forced to act as battle tanks—with predictably heavy casualties. The Mk VIB was numerically the most important model, with 832 produced. Its armament consisted of two water-cooled Vickers MG, one .50-cal and one ,303-cal. The end of production in 1940 included 100 + Mk VIC, which carried a 15mm MG and a ,303-cal MG, both air-cooled. In all, about 1180 of the Mk VI series were built. Small production runs of other light tanks preceded the Mk VI, but they saw little combat. Mk VI types were used in troops of three in the light tank squadrons of armoured and light tank regiments, and in the divisional cavalry regiments in the BEF. Four Mk VI were included in the HQ of both a light tank squadron and an Army Tank battalion, and one was allotted to the HQ of each Army Tank company. Mk VI models other than the VIC fought in Belgium, France, North Africa, and in other areas including Greece (4/41, with the 4th Hussars), Crete (5/41, with a squadron of the 3rd Hussars), Syria (6-7/41, with the Australian 6th and 9th Divisional Cavalry Regiments), Singapore (2/42, with the 18th Infantry Division), and Java (3/42, with C Squadron of the 3rd Hussars). The Mk VIC was used in combat only by the 1st Armoured Division in France; at least some of that division's armoured regiments allotted one Mk VIC per light tank troop.</p>
<p>†When using the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a> for the Mk VIB, make two To Kill DR—one each on the 12.7 and MG columns; only one DR (firer's choice) is used. This is indicated by &quot;2 TK DR (1 12.7; 1 MG)&quot; on the VIB counter.</p>
<p>†Mk VIB Dates and RF for ETO use are 5-6/40 (Belgium and France; 1.0), 4/41 (1.1), and 5/41 (1.4); for North Africa they are 6/40-3/41 (1.0), 4/41 (1.1), 5-6/41 (1.2), 7-8/41 (1.3), 9-10/41 (1.4), and 11-12/41 (1.5); for Syrian use they are 6-7/41 (1.4); for PTO use they are 2/42 (1.5) and 3/42 (1.2). Mk VIC Dates and RF are 5-6/40 and 1.3.</p>

(A17) Tetrarch &amp; Tetrarch CS [Light Tanks Mk VII &amp; Mk VII CS]:</span> Intended as the replacement for the Light Tank Mk VI, the Tetrarch entered production in 1940. However, at about that time it was decided that armored cars—not light tanks—would be used for reconnaissance, so only 171 Tetrarchs were built. A small number (probably about 10%) had, instead of the normal 2pdr MA, a 3-in. howitzer for the CS role. A Tetrarch was the first tank to be fitted with the Duplex Drive (DD) propulsion system. Tetrarchs were first used in action in Madagascar, by a Special Service Tank Squadron; thereafter they were held in reserve for airborne use, with the Hamilcar glider being designed specifically to transport them. One Tetrarch squadron of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was air-landed in Normandy on the evening of 6 June 1944, and the same unit used them in Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. (though these were the only times Tetrarchs saw combat, their Dates have been extended to make them somewhat more available for DYO use.) 20 Tetrarchs were sent to the USSR in 1941.</p>
<p>†Tetrarch Dates and RF are 5/42 (1.3) and 6/44-5/45 (1.6) [EXC: 1.5 for 6/44 and 3/45]. Tetrarch CS Dates-are the same.</p>

Stuart I(a) &amp; III(a): </span>These were the designations given to the U.S. M3 and M3A1 Light Tanks. The British, eager to supplement their supply of tanks in the Middle East and recognizing that the M3 in some ways approximated the effectiveness of their own Cruiser tanks, requested in early 1941 that it be Lend-Leased. Although officially named Stuarts, all light tanks of the M3-M5A1 series were commonly called Honeys due to their impressive reliability and handling characteristics. The British made certain changes to their M3, such as deleting the fixed BMG (to increase stowage space), altering certain crew positions and responsibilities, and adding smoke dischargers to some vehicles. Stuarts became the first U.S.-built tanks to see action in WW2 when they took part in Operation Crusader; in that battle they fully equipped the 7th Armoured Division's 4th Armoured Brigade and were used as Cruiser tanks. Thereafter in North Africa their numbers diminished as the increasing armor thickness and gun size of German tanks outpaced the Stuarts' development potential. In early 1942, several regiments newly equipped with Grant tanks each received a squadron of Stuarts whose primary function now became screening and reconnaissance; other Stuarts were attached to various units as escort/HQ vehicles. By the second battle of Alamein (10/42), Stuarts were being used in North Africa only in the 7th Armoured Division's 4th (Light) and 22nd Armoured Brigades, and in the 2nd New Zealand and 9th Australian Divisional Cavalry Regiments. In the PTO, Stuarts retained more of a primary combat role since in many ways they remained superior to the Japanese tanks they occasionally encountered. There they were used first in Burma, by the 7th Armoured Brigade's 7th Hussars and 2nd RTR; then later on Papua by elements of the 2/6th Australian Armoured Regiment; and lastly in India and Burma by the 7th Indian Light, and 45th Indian, Cavalry Regiments. A Stuart troop comprised three such tanks—except in HQ squadrons and in 1942 when &quot;mixed&quot; with Grants, where it had four. The recce troop of a 1944-45 armoured regiment or tank battalion was a special case, comprising eleven or twelve Stuarts.</p>
<p>†Stuart I Dates and RF for North Africa are 11/41-3/42 (1.1), 4-5/42 (1.2), and 6/42-5/43 (1.3); for PTO use they are 3-5/42 (Burma only; 1.1) and 12/42-1 /43 (Papua only; 1.3). Stuart HI Dates and RF for North Africa are 10/42-5/43 (1.4); for ETO use they are 1-4/44 (1.4) and 5/44-45 (1.3); for the PTO they are 3/44-45 (India-Burma only; 1.2).</p>

Stuarts apparently were not used in the ETO until 1944, after a recce troop had been added in late 1943 to the HQ squadron of each armoured regiment and tank battalion; by mid '44 most armoured recce regiments also had such a recce troop. The Stuart V was the most common model of the series in the ETO. The Yugoslav Partisans received as many as 56 in late 1944, and three Chinese provisional tank battalions equipped with them by the U.S. saw action in northern Burma in 1944-45.</p>

Locust (a):</span> In February 1941 the U.S. Army issued a requirement for an air-transportable light tank. Eventually a design was finalized, and by 2/44 830 Light Tanks M22 had been built. Unfortunately the Army Air Corps had failed to develop a suitable transport aircraft; consequently the only way the M22 could be air-lifted was to be slung, with its turret removed, beneath the fuselage of a C-54—a rather unsatisfactory way to land in a combat zone. As a result the M22 was never used operationally by U.S. forces. The British however had received some, which they named Locusts, and found that their Hamilcar glider could carry one. In this way a small number (apparently only six) were air-landed with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment during Operation Varsity—the Locust's only combat use in WW2. (However, its Dates have been extended to make it somewhat more available for DYO use.)</p>

A9 &amp; A9 CS [Cruiser Tanks Mk 1&amp; Mk 1 CS]:</span> The A9, first in the Cruiser tank series, replaced the obsolete 1920s-era Medium Mk II. Cost was a primary consideration in the A9's design, resulting in very thin armor being used. Besides mounting the new 2pdr gun it also carried three Vickers water-cooled MG, one coaxial with the main gun and two in small sub-turrets flanking the driver. 125 were built, including a small number of the CS version with its 3.7-in. howitzer. A9 types were used by the 1st Armoured Division in France in 1940, and by the 3rd RTR in Greece in 4/41. In North Africa they served in the 2nd and 7th Armoured Divisions, and some were with the besieged garrison of Tobruk in 1941. A troop of Cruiser tanks comprised three such AFV (sometimes four in 1944-45; see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#14" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 14</a>).</p>
<p><img src="britv010.jpg" width="344" height="310" alt="BritV010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />†BMG factor (4x2) is actually two 4 FP BMG: one in a starboard fore sub-turret and one in a port fore sub-turret. Neither may be Scrounged, but both may fire in the normal manner at targets that lie within this AFV's VCA. In addition, the starboard sub-turret may fire at a target that lies within this AFV's starboard-side front Target Facing, and the port sub-turret may fire within the port-side front Target Facing. See the accompanying diagram. No CA-change DRM apply to such fire [EXC: VCA-change DRM]. In all AFV with a &quot;#x2&quot; multiple-BMG arrangement, both BMG malfunction, and are repaired or disabled, individually. If the player has no appropriate AFV Card, all such occurrences must be noted on a side record.</p>
<p>†A9 Dates and RF for ETO use are 5-6/40 (France; 1.1) and 4/41 (Greece; 1.5); for North Africa they are 6-11/40 (1.1), 12/40-2/41 (1.0), 3/41 (1.1), 4-6/41 (1.2), 7-8/41 (1.3), 9-10/41 (1.4), and 11-12/41 (1.5). A9 CS Dates and RF for ETO use are 5-6/40 (France; 1.4) and 4/41 (Greece; 1.6); for North Africa they are 6-11/40 (1.4), 12/40-2/41 (1.3), 3-6/41 (1.4), and 7-12/41 (1.5).</p>

A10 Mk 1A &amp; Mk 1A CS [Cruiser Tanks Mk IIA &amp; Mk IIA CS]:</span> The design requirements of the A10 called for an infantry-support tank with thicker armor than the A9, to be built at as low a cost as possible. As a result the A9 was simply modified: Extra armor plates were bolted on, its cramped and disliked MG sub-turrets were replaced by a normal BMG, and its maximum speed was reduced to improve reliability. But by the time the A10 design was ready in early 1938 its armor was considered inadequate for infantry support, so its designation was changed to Heavy Cruiser even though it was really too slow to be effective in the Cruiser role. A production run of 175 was completed: 10 of the A10 Mk I (with a water-cooled CMG), 135 A10 Mk IA (with an air-cooled CMG), and 30 A10 Mk IA CS. They were used more or less interchangeably with A9 and A13 types. Most of the Cruiser tanks sent to Greece in 1941 were A10 types.</p>
<p>†BMG RF is 1.1. CS number is reduced to 4 if BMG is not present. †A10 Mk IA Dates and RF for ETO use are 5-6/40 (France; 1.3) and 4/41 (Greece; 1.1); for North Africa they are 12/40-2/41 (1.1), 3-4/41 (1.4), 5-8/41 (1.3), 9-10/41 (1.4), and 11-12/41 (1.5). For the AIO Mk IA CS in the ETO they are 4/41 (Greece; 1.4); for North Africa they are 12/40-2/41 (1.4), 3-4/41 (1.6), 5-8/41 (1.5), and 1.6 thereafter.</p>

Only 65 of the A13 Mk I were built, with all subsequent models having extra armor plates attached to the hull nose and the turret front and sides. This uparmored version was known as the A13 Mk II—or alternatively as the Cruiser Tank Mk IV or IVA, with the Mk IV having a water-cooled CMC and the Mk IVA an air-cooled CMG. 133 Mk IV and 172 Mk IVA (including a limited number of CS tanks), were built. While somewhat unreliable, the A13 series nonetheless was the design foundation upon which all subsequent Cruisers were based. A13 types were used in the same manner as A9 and A10 in France, Greece and North Africa, forming the striking power of British armoured divisions until replaced by the A15 Crusader.</p>
<p>†A13 Mk II Dates and RF for ETO use are 5-6/40 (France; 1.2) and 4/41 (Greece; 1.3); for North Africa they are 12/40-2/41 (1.2), 3-6/41 (1.0), 7-8/41 (1.1), 9-10/41 (1.2), and 11-12/41 (1.3). For A13 MkllCS use in the ETO they are 5-6/40 (France; 1.5) and 4/41 (Greece; 1.5); for North Africa they are 12/40-2/41 (1.5), 3-5/41 (1.3), 6-8/41 (1.4), and 9-12/41 (1.5).</p>

It was fast, low-slung, and better armored than its predecessors, but was notoriously unreliable due to having been ordered directly into production in August 1939 without sufficient testing. The Crusader II featured a slight increase in armor thickness, but retained the 2pdr gun which was now obsolete vs the newest PzKpfw III and IV. The Crusader CS carried a 3-in. howitzer. Both the Crusader I and the early Crusader II carried a BMG mounted in a sub-turret that was disliked due to being cramped, poorly ventilated, and often impossible to exit in an emergency; hence it was often removed. For simplicity, all Crusader I counters have this BMG while the Crusader II do not. The Crusader first saw action with the 6th RTR of the 7th Armoured Brigade in Operation Battleaxe—the abortive attempt to relieve Tobruk in June 1941—during which more Crusaders were lost to breakdowns than to combat. Thereafter it became the most numerous Allied tank in the desert until the arrival of Grants and Shermans.</p>

Crusader III: </span>It was planned to mount the new 6pdr gun in the Cavalier, not the Crusader. However, the failure of the Cavalier design made it necessary to adapt other tanks to carry the gun. Mounting the 6pdr in the Crusader II required that one turret crewman be omitted, thus giving the Crusader III a two-man turret with the tank commander doubling as loader. At the start of the second battle of Alamein, 8th Army had 78 Crusader III available for immediate action. The 6th Armoured Division entered the North African campaign in Tunisia with Crusader III constituting about 40% of its tank strength. 4,350 Crusaders I-III were built, plus another 1,373 special-purpose variants (AA tanks, recovery vehicles, etc.).</p>

Grant(a) &amp; Lee(a):</span> After the bulk of their Modern tanks had been lost in France, the British sent a tank mission to the U.S. in an attempt to obtain the production of British tank designs in American factories. They were informed, however, that only designs accepted by the U.S. Army could be produced in the U.S., although some modifications for British use would be allowed. The mission therefore placed &quot;cash &amp; carry&quot; orders for the M3 Medium Tank straight off the drawing board, but with a new turret of British design. This they named the &quot;Grant&quot;, while &quot;Lee&quot; was used for the standard versions of the M3 series (which were Lend-Leased somewhat later). 167 Grants, divided between the 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions, were present at the start of the Gazala battles (the Grant's first use in combat). They provided a nasty surprise to the Germans, for they substantially increased the effective engagement range of British tank units and for the first time gave them an effective HE-firing weapon to deal with A-T guns. The Lee/Grant design had several drawbacks, such as its bulk and the positioning of its 75mm gun in the hull—but nevertheless it at last provided the British with a tank that could engage the German panzers on more even terms; in fact it was sometimes referred to as &quot;ELH&quot; (Egypt's Last Hope). At Gazala the establishment of a Grant-equipped armoured regiment was either two squadrons of Grants and one of Stuarts or one of Grants and two of Crusaders. By the second battle of Alamein some 170-180 Lee/Grants were available for immediate action and their regiments often contained a mixture of Shermans, Grants and Crusaders. After the North African campaign most Lees and Grants were shipped to India and Australia, with some eventually seeing combat again in eastern India and Burma. 1,685 Grants were built, and 1,202 Lees were Lend-Leased to the British. A Lee/Grant troop comprised three such tanks.</p>
<p>†B11 applies individually to both the 37LL MA and 75 SA. The 37LL MA is a T Gun, while the 75 SA is a bow-mounted NT Gun. Either the MA or SA can claim the possibility of multiple-ROF/armor-leader-direction, but only the one that fires first in a phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase) can actually use it. Either the MA and SA both have Gyrostabilizer benefits or neither does; i.e., when using <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.42" class="topiclink">H1.42</a> one dr applies to both Guns.</p>

Sherman II(a):</span> When news of Tobruk's fall on 21 June 1942 reached Churchill, he immediately asked Roosevelt for as many new Shermans as could be made available. In response it was first proposed that Gen. Patton and the entire U.S. 2nd Armored Division should be sent directly to Egypt. Orders to this effect were issued, but were then cancelled when it was learned that, due to the problems inherent in such a move, the division could not arrive there until late in the year— which might well be too late. Consequently, Shermans were taken from units in the U.S. and shipped to Egypt. By the time of the second battle of Alamein, 8th Army had 285 of which some 250 were available for immediate action; about two-thirds of these were Sherman II (the M4A1 Medium Tank). Only 942 Sherman II were Lend-Leased to the British, and its prominence on the battlefield was soon eclipsed by other Sherman types.</p>

Sherman IIC(a) &amp; VC(a):</span> When it became obvious that the Challenger would not be available in time for the Normandy landings, the Sherman was suggested as an alternative to carry the powerful 17pdr gun. The feasibility of this was doubted, but an experimental installation proved it would indeed work with a minor adaptation of components. Subsequently a rush conversion program produced enough 17pdr-Shermans (nicknamed Fireflies) by June 1944 to provide an average of one per non-DD Sherman troop, and one per Cromwell troop in the 7th Armoured Division's 22nd Armoured Brigade. The Firefly at last gave the British a tank whose gun equalled or bettered those mounted in the majority of German tanks, as well as being superior to all U.S. tank guns. It was often used from an &quot;overwatch&quot; position; i.e., sitting back behind cover, protecting the forward ranks of 75mm Shermans against Tigers and Panthers. The Panzers rightly feared it, and had standing orders to attack Fireflies first in any engagement. The Firefly had neither a BMG nor its corresponding crewman, his position being used to stow extra MA rounds. The most common version of the Firefly was the VC, a converted Sherman V; the next most common types were the IIC and the Hybrid IC (the latter being based on the Sherman I and equivalent to the IIC in game terms). &quot;C&quot; in the British designation denoted the 17pdr gun. In all, about 600 Fireflies were produced.</p>

(A27L) Centaur IV [Cruiser Tank Mk VIII]: </span>Initially, the new engine designed for the Cromwell could not be provided in sufficient quantity, so the old Liberty engine used in the A13 and Crusader was installed in some of the early production models. This version was designated the A27L Centaur. About 950 were built, but the only model to see action in its original form was the Centaur IV. (Many of the other models were eventually converted to Cromwells by retrofitting the latter's 75mm gun and engine.) All 80 Centaur IV built were used by the Royal Marine Armoured Support Group, which was formed specifically to assist selected assault units of the 3rd and 50th British, and 3rd Canadian, Infantry Divisions during the initial stages of the Normandy landings. The Centaurs were to fire from their LCTs during the run-in to the beach, then land to provide close support and on-call indirect fire for 24 hours. In the event, only 21 landed on time and able to engage the enemy; by mid morning 48 (plus 12 Shermans) were ashore, and the last dozen landed on D + l. They provided valuable support and, working with a number of different units, ultimately remained in action for more than two weeks.

It was the fastest British Cruiser tank—though later models were geared down to improve the reliability of the suspension—and numerically was the most important British-built tank in 1944-45. Cromwells equipped the 7th Armoured Division's 22nd Armoured Brigade and the armoured recce regiments of the 7th, 11th, Guards, and 1st Polish Armoured Divisions—all of which fought only in NWE. A troop officially comprised three such tanks, but generally a fourth tank was also present—a Sherman Firefly for a troop in an armoured regiment, or a Challenger for an armoured recce regiment troop.

Unfortunately the Cromwell was basically unsuitable for such a powerful gun, and numerous problems and delays were encountered during development. Many of the Challenger's deficiencies were never fully rectified, and concern about this led directly to the concept of the Sherman Firefly. Even after being put into production the Challenger was still not considered truly battleworthy—but its potent armament was needed in combat, so it was issued to the Cromwell-equipped armoured recce regiments of the 7th, 11th, Guards, and 1st Polish Armoured Divisions, in which it was used in the same manner as the Firefly. 200 Challengers were built. †RF is 1.6 in 8/44, 1.5 in 9/44, and 1.4 thereafter.</p>

The Comet's gun, officially called the 77mm, was actually a less powerful version of the 17pdr. This seemingly retrograde step was taken to ensure that the gun would not overstress the vehicle as had been the case with the Challenger. Though it was planned to have the Comet replace the Cromwell in 1944, development and testing took longer than expected, and it did not enter combat until after the crossing of the Rhine. It was used only in the armoured regiments and armoured recce regiment of the 11th Armoured Division, replacing all the Shermans in that division. About 1,200 Comets were built between April 1944 and May 1945. Only a few years after the war they began to be replaced by Centurions, the first six of which had arrived in Germany in May 1945 too late to see combat.</p>

The British built 689 Crabs between Sept. 1943 and Dec. 1944, and the vast majority were used in the 30th Armoured Brigade of the 79th Armoured Division—though in Italy they were employed in the 51st RTR as part of the 25th Armoured Engineer Brigade. During the Normandy landings, Crabs unintentionally were the first gun tanks ashore on many of the Canadian and British beaches, and the value of their ability to fight as well as flail was immediately proven. A Crab troop comprised five such tanks; generally, three flailed while the other two stood by in reserve, ready to provide covering fire. The common practice in NWE was to allot one or more Crab troops to a local commander when the situation warranted their use; when their mine-clearing tasks were finished, they were withdrawn from his control.</p>

The design specifications of the Matilda called for it to be small (i.e., inconspicuous) but well armored. A top speed greater than that of infantry was held to be unnecessary. Also of prime importance was that it be inexpensive to manufacture. Series production of the Matilda I began in 1937 and ran to 139 vehicles—77 of which went to France with the 4th and 7th RTR, forming the majority of tank strength in the 1st Army Tank Brigade. They proved nearly impervious to German 37mm A-T guns, but by the end of May all had been destroyed or abandoned. The remaining 63 Matilda I in England were used only for training.</p>

(A12) Matilda II &amp; II CS [Infantry Tank Mk II]:</span> The Infantry Tank Mk II was faster and more heavily armored than its predecessor, and carried a gun capable of destroying any German tank in use in 1940. It was sometimes called the Matilda Senior while the Matilda I was still in service, but later was referred to simply as the Matilda. Its thick hide and well-protected tracks (which were covered by an outer layer of armor) made it virtually invulnerable to all but the German 88—as was shown in France at the battle of Arras. (Indeed, it is said that the Germans developed APCR directly in response to their experiences with Matildas in France.) In North Africa, after playing a large part in the rout of the Italian 10th Army in late 1940, the Matilda was dubbed &quot;Queen of the Battlefield&quot;. In 1941 even German tankers showed a marked reluctance to engage it with anything less than overwhelming superiority—a condition the British called &quot;Matilda-itis&quot;. However, its lack of speed in the mobile desert war, its inability to be upgunned and the lethality of the 88 eventually caused its demise. Only 23 were used in France—all in the 1st Army Tank Brigade. Many were used in North Africa, seeing action in the 1st and 32nd Army Tank Brigades. In addition, B Squadron of the 4th RTR used Matildas in Eritrea, and eight fought on Crete with the 7th RTR. Matildas were used in the PTO by the Australians, first on New Guinea, then later on Bougainville and in Borneo; they also developed a FT version, a few of which were used 7-8/45. 2,987 Matilda II types were built.</p>
<p>Throughout the war, a troop (called a section, prior to 1941) of Infantry tanks contained three &quot;I&quot; tanks of the same basic model (e.g., Matilda II or Valentines, etc.); CS models were normally found in a fighting troop only in the PTO, where the Australians used one CS and two 2pdr-versions per troop. Very generally, when &quot;I&quot; tanks were available one troop was allotted to each assaulting infantry company. Amazingly, a 1940 Army Tank Brigade—a formation whose sole function was to provide front line armor support for infantry operations—contained not one HE-firing weapon. This was belatedly, but only partially, remedied in early 1941 by the addition of a few CS &quot;I&quot; tanks to each squadron.</p>
<p>†One Matilda variant which saw action after mid 1942 was the Matilda Scorpion, an early type of flail tank. 32 were available at the start of the second battle of Alamein, and some were used during the fighting at the Mareth and Wadi Akarit lines. In action they proved rather unreliable due to inherent weaknesses in the flail mechanism. Any Matilda II appearing in a North African scenario in/after 10/42 is a Scorpion (BPV: 56; RF: 1.6). It retains the use of all its armament, and all Flail Tank rules apply. [EXC: A +1 DRM applies to the Mine Clearance DR, and the DR given in <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.7" class="topiclink">B28.7-.72</a> for each possible result is assumed to be a Final DR. In addition, it may not clear wire like the Sherman Crab.] If the use of Vehicle Dust (<a href="chf_chf11.htm#11.74" class="topiclink">F11.74</a>) is allowed in the scenario, a +2 gray Dispersed Smoke counter is immediately placed in the Scorpion's Location as it enters a new hex to flail therein (and is removed when it begins its next MPh without a declaration [<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.7" class="topiclink">B28.7</a>] to flail again).</p>
<p>†Before any type of Immobilization result due to an attack [EXC: one caused by mines, or by a Direct Fire hit vs the front or rear Target Facing] takes effect, a subsequent dr must be made. If this dr is ≤ 3, Immobilization occurs; if ≥ 4, it does not. This is signified on the counter by &quot;Immob: dr ≤ 3&quot;.</p>
<p>†Matilda II Dates and RF for ETO use are 5/40 (France; 1.4) and 5/41 (Crete; 1.5); for North Africa they are 12/40 (1.1), 1/41 (1.3), 2/41 (1.4), 3/41 (1.5), 4/41 (1.3), 5-12/41 (1.2), 1-4/42 (1.3), 5/42 (1.4), 6/42 (1.5), and 7/42 (1.6); for East Africa (Eritrea) they are 1-4/41 (1.3); for the PTO they are 11/43-2/44 (1.2), and 1945 (1.2). For the Matilda II CS, use Matilda II Dates [EXC: the CS version is not available prior to 5/41 nor in Crete] and RF, but increase the RF by .2 for North African use (to a maximum of 1.6), and by .1 for PTO use.</p>

Initially deemed unacceptable, in mid 1939 with war imminent it was ordered into production &quot;straight off the drawing board&quot;—and surprisingly proved to be one of the most reliable British tanks of the war. Though designed as an &quot;I&quot; tank it was often used as a Cruiser, in which role it was handicapped by its low speed and poor turret layout. 350 Valentine I were built, but apparently none were sent overseas. 675 Valentine II were built, plus an undetermined number of Valentine IV (which the game piece also represents). The difference between the three models lay solely in the type of engine used. Valentine II and IV made their greatest contribution to the Allied cause with 8th Army in North Africa, where they were used by the 1st and 32nd Army Tank Brigades and the 23rd Armoured Brigade. A small number were also used by a Special Service Tank Squadron in the invasion of Madagascar.</p>
<p>†RF for use in North Africa is 1.3 for 11/41-4/42, 1.1 for 5-6/42, 1.0 for 7-8/42, 1.1 for 9-10/42, 1.2 for 11-12/42, and 1.3 in 1943. Dates and RF for use in Madagascar are 5/42 and 1.1.</p>

Those with the new turret were designated Mk III or V depending on the type of engine installed (and are equivalent in game terms). Their main combat use was in Tunisia with the 6th Armoured Division, which used mixed squadrons of Valentine III, Valentine V and Crusader III until re-equipped with Sherman III in March 1943 (at which time the Valentines were turned over to the French Army in Tunisia). In the PTO the three-man-turret Valentine was apparently used just once, with the 3rd New Zealand Division's Special Army Tank Squadron Group during the 2/44 assault on Green Island. 25 Valentine III were employed there, with 9 carrying 3-in. howitzers instead of the standard 2pdr armament—a conversion made by the New Zealanders to give their Valentines a good HE capability.</p>

Production of the 6pdr versions, designated Mks VIII and IX depending on the make of engine fitted (and equivalent in game terms), began in March 1942 but a year passed before any saw combat. 8th Army's employment of a few in Tunisia was apparently their only use in action with British forces. The Mk X was a late-production Mk IX with the CMG restored; however, it seems that none were used in combat by the British. Valentines were the original selection for conversion to DD tanks, and at least 650 of the 6pdr and three-man-turret models were so modified—but in late 1943 it was decided in the interests of standardization to use Shermans instead.</p>

Being derived from the 6pdr, this gun was not much bigger than the weapon it replaced and was thus able to fit into the Valentine's narrow turret. Valentine XI were used as battery commanders' vehicles in AT regiments equipped with Archers, and apparently also in some equipped with Wolverines/Achilles. A total of 8,275 Valentines were built (inclusive of all variants, and of 1,420 Mks VI-VIIA produced in Canada), making it one of the most important British tanks of the mid-war period. Even so, close to half were sent to the USSR.</p>

The new tank, designated A20, was to have the ability to cross very wide trenches and ground churned up by shellfire. It was not a success, but after Dunkirk it was hurriedly redesigned as the A22 (later officially named the Churchill) and put into immediate production; not surprisingly, the early models suffered from numerous mechanical defects. 303 Churchill I were built. After first seeing combat in the Dieppe debacle, the Mk I was employed as a CS vehicle in the 21st and 25th Tank Brigades in Tunisia and Italy. 1,127 Churchill II were also produced, with a BMG replacing the hull-mounted 3-in. howitzer—but most were either sent to the USSR or rebuilt as Mks III_and IV.</p>
<p>†The 40L MA is a T Gun, while the 76* SA is a bow-mounted NT Gun. Either the MA or SA can claim the possibility of multiple-ROF/armor-leader-direction, but only the one that fires first in a phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase) can actually use it.</p>
<p>†Due to the very limited traverse of the bow-mounted 76* SA, it receives a cumulative +1 DRM when firing at a moving/Motion target [EXC: Infantry expending MF without changing Location]—as signified by a white dot on the counter beside the SA designation.</p>

Ultimately, two styles were produced: one of welded armor plate and another which was equivalent but made of cast armor. The Churchill III had the welded turret and the Churchill IV the cast version. The Mk III had its baptism of fire at Dieppe. Later, six Mk III were sent to Egypt for desert trials: Termed Kingforce, under the command of 1st Armoured Division they participated in two engagements during the second battle of Alamein, and were then withdrawn for evaluation. Churchill III and IV also saw action in Tunisia and Italy with the 21st and 25th Tank Brigades, and in NWE with the 6th Guards, 31st and 34th Tank Brigades.

The resulting Churchill VII, while in external appearance quite similar to its predecessors, in fact contained many improvements beyond its thicker armor. The Churchill VIII was identical to the VII aside from its low-velocity howitzer for the CS role. About 1,600 Mk VII and VIII were built. The Churchill was the second most numerous type of British-built tank in NWE, and was used in the 6th Guards, 31st and 34th Tank Brigades. The Mk VII and VIII appeared in Italy only late in the war, being used there in the 21st Tank Brigade. Some of the earlier Churchill Mks were improved to roughly Mk Vn standards by the addition of applique hull armor and, in some cases, the Mk VII turret; designated Mks IX-XI, these have not been included in the game. Total Churchill production was 5,640 vehicles. Since even the Churchill VII's hull was too narrow to accommodate the large turret needed to carry a 17pdr, a widened version called the Black Prince was developed. However, none of the six prototypes produced prior to VE Day saw combat, and the project was later cancelled in favor of the much superior Centurion.</p>

<p>• PLACEMENT: The bridge can be placed &quot;across&quot; only a trench, A-T ditch, canal, the shellholes in a hex, or a gully/stream—and only by a Stopped Bridgelayer (whose crew is neither stunned nor shocked) during its MPh at a cost of 8 &quot;delay&quot; MP (expended in one MPh) while it is ADJACENT to the Location &quot;across&quot; which it wishes to place the bridge. This Location must also be within the Bridgelayer's VCA. Only one bridge may be placed per hex, and may be placed across neither an unbreached wall/hedge hexside nor a Depression Hexside. A bridge placed &quot;across&quot; a gully/stream is at its Crest level. A Bridgelayer that becomes immobilized while Non-Stopped (including via an Unbogging DR), or that is Bogged/Mired, cannot place its bridge. The Bridgelayer's owner first announces the placement attempt, then makes an X# DR to check for possible disablement of the Bridgelaying mechanism. If this Final DR (see DESTRUCTION) is ≥ 12 the bridge cannot be placed and the Bridgelayer is immediately Recalled; on a Final DR of ≤ 11 placement commences, and only then does the AFV begin expending &quot;delay&quot; MP. After thusly expending the 8 MP the bridge is placed; position it such that its &quot;length&quot; is perpendicular to the hexside that is common to both its own hex and that of the Bridgelayer. Once the bridge has been placed, the Bridgelayer is flipped over to its &quot;bridgeless&quot; side and is immediately Recalled; the extra MP gained may be used immediately if the Bridgelayer is otherwise allowed to do so (including having not yet expended ≥ its new MP allotment).</p>
<p>• DESTRUCTION: A turret hit vs a Bridgelayer that is carrying its bridge is treated as a bridge hit instead. When such a hit is achieved (or when a DC is Placed &quot;on the turret&quot;; <a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.346" class="topiclink">C7.346</a>), a dr is made on the following table to see if damage occurs:</p>

Churchill AVRE:</span> The Dieppe raid in 1942 emphasized the sappers' need for some kind of armored vehicle to assist with the demolition of obstacles while under fire. The Churchill was chosen for this because of its roomy interior and the large hatches on the sides of its hull. In this role it was designated the Armoured Vehicle, Royal Engineer—or AVRE. Churchill III and IV were used for the conversion, with applique armor added to increase their survivability. A new MA, the Petard spigot mortar, was devised: This short-range 290mm weapon fired a 40-lb. projectile (called the &quot;Flying Dustbin&quot; due to its shape) which was filled with 23 lbs. of plastic explosive and capable of destroying heavy concrete obstacles such as pillboxes and sea walls. The Petard was not loaded from inside the turret; rather, it was hinged outside the turret, and was opened and reloaded by the BMG operator through a special hatch above his head. Inside, the AVRE carried a number of special explosive charges which had to be hand-placed outside the vehicle by one or more of its crewmen, but which could be detonated from within the AVRE. A number of bridging, charge-placing, mine-clearing and mat-laying devices (the latter to help vehicles cross soft beach sand) could be fitted to the AVRE, but perhaps its most important secondary role was as a fascine carrier. A fascine was a bundle of brushwood typically about 8 ft. in diameter and 11-14 ft. long, carried on a special frame over the AVRE's front hull. It was used to fill ditches, bomb craters and small streams so that vehicles could cross them.</p>
<p>180 AVRE were available for the Normandy landings; see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#74" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 74</a>. AVRE were used in NWE by the 1st Assault Brigade, Royal Engineers, of the 79th Armoured Division; and in Italy by the 1st Armoured Engineer Regiment of the 25th Armoured Engineer Brigade. An AVRE troop comprised six such vehicles, but normally this was deployed into two three-vehicle halftroops. 754 AVRE were produced during the war. †RF for NWE use is 1.2. Dates and RF for use in Italy are 4-5/45 and 1.3.</p>
<p><img src="britv045.jpg" width="176" height="79" alt="BritV045" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />†CREW: The original Inherent crew of an AVRE are also Assault Engineers (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.22" class="topiclink">H1.22</a>) and Sappers (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.8" class="topiclink">B28.8</a>). An AVRE starts each scenario Inherently carrying four DC which can take counter form only when that AVRE's original crew voluntarily Abandons it; i.e., when the crew voluntarily takes counter form it can automatically possess &gt; one of those DC. Moreover, as long as an original AVRE crew counter possesses ≥ one of these DC it is considered Fanatic. These DC may not be Thrown, and may be Placed or Set only by an Assault Engineer. In addition to their normal IFT capabilities, these DC may be Set to Breach wall/hedge [EXC: bocage] hexsides over which the AVRE crew counter can claim Wall Advantage (even if no enemy unit is present); such an attempt requires the normal all-MF expenditure for Setting a DC, but no US# dr is required. When detonated, a Final KIA breaches the wall/hedge; see &quot;BREACH&quot; below for effects [EXC: this DC Breach attempt has no TK/IFT effects]. The crew may detonate its Set DC in the normal manner, or while Inherent again in the AVRE provided all other conditions applicable to detonating it are met [EXC: the thusly Inherent crew may detonate it while &lt; two hexes away from it]; if the AVRE expends a Start MP after its crew re-enters it but prior to detonation, the DC is no longer considered Set. If an AVRE's original crew voluntarily Abandons it, taking with them ≥ one of their DC, the AVRE retains an Inherent Driver.</p>
<p>†Use a Churchill VII Wreck counter to depict an AVRE wreck.</p>
<p>†MA: The AVRE's MA uses the <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C3 To Hit</a> process [EXC: Area Target Type and TH Case L are NA], but its Basic TH# is &quot;12&quot; and each hex of range reduces this number by two. In addition, if the MA fires while the TCA does not coincide with the VCA, the TCA then immediately (but after any simultaneous Gun Duel shot vs it by an enemy unit), and automatically, changes so that it does coincide with the VCA (even if such a Gun Duel shot stuns/shocks the AVRE's crew). An AVRE is not Recalled due solely to MA disablement, provided its crew can still use/detonate ≥ one of its DC. An AVRE's MA has normal HE capabilities, and can also perform the following actions:</p>
<p><img src="britv046.jpg" width="81" height="79" alt="BritV046" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />• vs MINES: The MA can clear mines as per <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">B28.62</a>, provided its TH DR would have hit any concealed enemy Infantry in the mined Location (even if none are actually present).</p>
<p><img src="britv047.jpg" width="91" height="89" alt="BritV047" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />•vs PILLBOX: The MA can eliminate a pillbox. To do so it must fire (or, if the pillbox is unoccupied, must be treated as if it were firing) at Known enemy Infantry in that pillbox <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: TH Case E is NA]</span>. An Original KIA on the IFT eliminates the pillbox (and all its contents) if that KIA's # is ≥ the pillbox TEM that applied to the TH DR.</p>
<p><img src="britv048.jpg" width="78" height="78" alt="BritV048" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />• BREACH: The MA can Breach a wall/hedge [EXC: bocage] hexside that lies within its TCA and that is not parallel to the center hexspine of that TCA, provided the owner declares such an attempt prior to the shot. If the AVRE could claim Wall Advantage over that hexside (even if no enemy unit is present), then its range to that hexside is &quot;zero&quot; and TH Case E is NA; however, such an attack has no effect [EXC: SAN] on anything other than that hexside. Otherwise the MA must fire (or must be treated as if it were firing) at Known enemy Infantry (even if none are present) directly behind that hexside claiming its TEM. The maximum range at which such a Breach may be attempted is limited only by the AVRE's TH ability. An Original KIA on the IFT creates a Breach (in addition to its effects—if any—vs enemy Infantry); thereafter, movement/Manhandling across that hexside are treated as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.541" class="topiclink">B9.541</a>. The Breach has no other effect. See the accompanying diagram and example.</p>
<p><img src="britv050.jpg" width="507" height="379" alt="BritV050" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />EX: Assume the AVRE in the accompanying diagram is not carrying a fascine. Within its current TCA it may attempt to Breach with its MA a wall/hedge that lies along any hexside marked with a thick black bar in the illustration. If the AVRE can claim Wall Advantage and incurs no TH DRM, to hit a wall along hexside F2-G3 or F3-G3 will require an Original TH DR of ≤ 12 (Basic TH# at zero-hex range, with no wall TEM); if it cannot claim Wall Advantage the same shot will require an Original TH DR of ≤ 8 (10 [Basic TH# at one-hex range, since it must be treated as firing at Known Infantry in F2 or F3 respectively] with a +2 TH DRM [wall TEM]). Vs the Breachable hexsides between hexrows E and F it will require an Original TH DR of ≤ 6 (8 [Basic TH# at two-hex range] with a +2 TH DRM [wall TEM]), etc. The AVRE may attempt to Breach such hexsides beyond the area illustrated.</p>
<p> <img src="britv052.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="BritV052" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />†FASCINE: An AVRE can be designated by scenario OB or DYO purchase as carrying one fascine—in which case the reverse side of the AVRE counter (whose artwork depicts a fascine mounted on the vehicle) is used, and a Fascine counter is placed on it. The following apply to an AVRE while it is carrying a fascine:</p>
<p>•WEIGHT &amp; MP: Its weight is 44 tons, and its MP allotment is 7.</p>
<p>•BU/CE: While BU it must pay one extra MP per hex entered, just as if it were towing a Gun (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>)—as signified by &quot;Towing MP&quot; on the Fascine counter. Its CE DRM (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.31" class="topiclink">D5.31</a>) is +1, not +2—as signified by &quot;CE(+ 1)&quot; on the Fascine counter. If the AVRE becomes BU, flip the Fascine counter to its &quot;BU&quot; side.</p>
<p>•ARMAMENT: Its MA cannot fire—as signified by the lack of a Gun Caliber Size on the AVRE counter—but its CMG can. Its BMG receives a cumulative +1 DRM to all fire at a moving/Motion target—as signified on the AVRE counter by a white dot behind the BMG factor.</p>
<p>•TCA: Its TCA is considered to be centered on the rearward portside hex-spine of its hex; see the accompanying diagram and example. Moreover, this TCA may not be changed relative to the AVRE's VCA (i.e., the turret is immoveable in this position). When placing the Fascine counter on the AVRE, align it to properly indicate the AVRE's VCA and TCA.</p>
<p>EX: An AVRE carrying a fascine has its TCA limited to the one shown in the accompanying diagram.</p>
<p>†FASCINE USAGE: A fascine can be placed voluntarily only &quot;into&quot; a trench or A-T Ditch, or INTO a shallow/deep stream—and only by a Stopped AVRE (whose crew is neither stunned nor shocked) during its MPh at a cost of one &quot;delay&quot; MP while it is ADJACENT to the Location &quot;into'VINTO which it wishes to place the fascine. This Location must also be within the AVRE's VCA. A fascine placed &quot;into&quot; a trench or A-T ditch Location thereafter allows any vehicle to enter/exit that Location as if it contained foxholes instead; its only effect on Infantry is to force them to leave the trench or A-T ditch (if they are in it) in that Location before they can enter any adjacent Location. Each fascine placed INTO a shallow/deep stream Location thereafter provides a -1 DRM to the Bog DR of a vehicle that is exiting that Location to a non-Depression hex. While a vehicle [EXC: motorcycle] is in a placed-fascine Location it negates all fascine benefits in that Location for another vehicle (as does any wreck created in that Location after the first fascine is placed there). A placed fascine has no game effect other than those just given.</p>
<p>As an alternative to placement, a fascine can be dropped voluntarily. Dropping it (whether voluntarily or not; see below) is accomplished in the same manner as placing it, with the following exceptions: it can also be dropped (at no penalty) during the AVRE's DFPh upon the owner's declaration of doing so; it can be dropped in any type of terrain, and; a dropped fascine is immediately removed from play with no effect beyond allowing its AVRE counter to be flipped over (see below). Any Effects [EXC: mine attack] DR vs a fascine-bearing AVRE which fails by one to achieve any effect on the AFV Destruction Table causes its fascine to be dropped involuntarily upon an immediately subsequent dr of &quot; 1&quot; [EXC: for a FT/MOL attack, assume a subsequent dr of &quot; 1&quot;].</p>
<p>When a fascine is placed/dropped, that AVRE counter is then (after resolving any Defensive First Fire allowed vs it by MP expenditure) flipped to its non-fascine side: its TCA can, at the owner's option, either remain in the side facing shown in the AVRE diagram or can be instantly changed to coincide with the VCA; the extra MP gained can be used immediately if the AVRE is otherwise able (and allowed) to do so.</p>
<p>Once placed/dropped, a fascine cannot be moved/retrieved in any way— nor can it be set Aflame/Ablaze, targeted individually, or affected by an attack [EXC: it is removed if a Blaze or rubble occurs in its Location, or if the trench/A-T ditch it is &quot;in&quot; is eliminated by OBA]. A fascine is neither an obstacle nor a Hindrance to LOS.</p>
<p>†As a form of optional &quot;armament&quot;, a fascine has a RF of .9 and a BPV of 2. Extra fascines (i.e., more than the number of AVRE in the player's OB) may not be purchased.</p>

Churchill Crocodile:</span> Probably the most famous flamethrowing AFV of WW2, and certainly one of the most fearsome weapons in the Allied arsenal, the Crocodile was a conversion of the Churchill VII. The FT gun replaced the BMG, and a two-wheeled, armored trailer carried the flame fuel and tanks of pressurized-nitrogen propellant, all this equipment being provided in kit form. The FT fuel was a liquid form of napalm which adhered to almost everything it touched, and whose flame was extremely difficult to extinguish. Crocodiles first saw combat on D-Day, with the 141st Regiment of the Royal Armoured Corps. Shortly thereafter, this unit became part of the 79th Armoured Division, which later also incorporated the 1st Fife and Forfar Yeomanry and the 7th RTR—two more Crocodile units. Together these units formed the 31st Armoured Brigade. Crocodiles were occasionally called on to support U.S. units—e.g., during the assault on Brest—and received high praise for their valuable assistance. In Italy, Crocodiles were used in the 51st RTR, which was part of the 25th Armoured Engineer Brigade. In June 1944 a Crocodile troop comprised four such AFV (later sometimes three, depending on the date and unit). About 800 Crocodile kits were produced, but not all were used operationally.</p>
<p>†X# applies only to the SA FT.</p>
<p>†The Crocodile's trailer has an AF of 6, and can be instantly disconnected (even if destroyed) by its non-shocked, non-stunned Inherent crew without need of MP expenditure or losing Motion status. Once the trailer is. disconnected, replace the Crocodile with a Churchill VII counter marked with a BMG Disabled counter; the extra MP gained can be used immediately if the AFV is otherwise able (and allowed) to do so. TK Case A never applies to a trailer. [ERRATA: A trailer, regardless of type/to wing-vehicle, never leaves a wreck when it is destroyed.]</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for NWE use are 6-9/44 (1.3), 10/44-1/45 (1.2), and 2-5/45 (1.1). For use in Italy they are 4-5/45 and 1.3.</p>

Deacon:</span> Designed to increase the mobility of AT guns in North African use and to enhance the protection of their crews, the Deacon was an armored version of the AEC Matador MAT (medium artillery tractor) mounting a 6pdr in a partially open turret with a traverse of 319°. In 1942 some were sent to Egypt, where they equipped 1-2 batteries in at least some non-divisional AT regiments and the AT regiments in armoured divisions. Later in that campaign some were also attached to various armoured car squadrons. Deacons, also known as &quot;Yellow Devils&quot;, were used successfully on several occasions but were not well liked due to their slow speed and overloaded chassis. 176 were built, but in 1943 and 1944, 42 were converted to armored ammo carriers for Priest SP guns. The remainder eventually were passed on to Turkey. A Deacon troop comprised four such vehicles.</p>
<p><img src="britv056.jpg" width="340" height="373" alt="BritV056" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />†The MA may not fire at a target that lies within the starboard side of the Deacon's VCA. In addition, the TCA may not move &quot;across&quot; that area when traversing. See the accompanying diagram and example. These restrictions are signified by &quot;Stbd VCA NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>EX: In the diagram, the Deacon can fire at a target in hex N2 or O3 [EXC: not at vertex O3-O2-P2 or O3-P2-P3], or at one in O2 Bypassing along hexside O2-N2. It cannot fire at a target in P1 or P2, nor at one in P3 that is not in Bypass along hexside P3-O4. If it wishes to fire at a target in Q2 or Q3, it must traverse its turret counterclockwise; i.e., the turret may not traverse across hexside P4-P3.</p>
<p>†The turret's rear Target Facing is unarmored.</p>
<p>†The CE DRM (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.31" class="topiclink">D5.31</a>) against incoming fire through any armored turret Target Facing is +3 instead of the normal +2. This is signified by &quot;CE:+3&quot; on the counter.</p>

Archer:</span> To help maximize the future availability of SP 17pdrs, the design of a version based on the Valentine tank was begun in mid 1942. Production of the Archer—the first full-tracked, British-built TD of any consequence in the war—began in early 1944, utilizing the late-model Valentine chassis. In July of that year, four were shipped to Normandy and another four to Italy, but not until late that year did Archer-equipped units enter combat. The Archer was unusual in that the gun faced to the vehicle's rear, which nullified its value in an offensive role, but which proved handy when having to quickly pull out of a position. The design also placed the breech of the 17pdr directly behind the driver's head, thus making firing on the move impossible. Archers were used in troops of four in AT regiments, but outside of Italy apparently not in those assigned to armoured divisions. 665 were built.</p>

Daimler &amp; Lynx Scout Cars:</span> In early 1938 the War Office requested a very small, partially armored vehicle to be used for scouting and liaison. This eventually resulted in the &quot;Car, Scout, Mk I&quot;—more commonly known as the Daimler Scout Car. Nicknamed the &quot;Dingo&quot;, it featured a number of advanced design concepts for its time. Production ran to 6,626 vehicles in five Marks, the last of which was open-topped. (The earlier Mks had a sliding or folding roof, but as this was rarely closed—and often was actually removed—the game piece is OT.) Dingos proved quite successful, and the resulting demand for scout cars led to several other companies being asked to produce similar types. Ford of Canada answered this call by producing the Lynx, a copy of the Daimler. To get it into production as quickly as possible, already-existing automotive components were utilized, and because of this its exterior dimensions were significantly greater than those of the Daimler. 3,255 Lynx were built. The Daimler's first combat came in Belgium and France, with 21 in the 4th Battalion of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, the recce battalion of the 50th Infantry Division, and 30 more in the various HQ units of the 1st Armoured Division. Thereafter as scout cars became more available they were allotted to many different types of units. From mid 1943 the Daimler SC was most commonly employed in armoured car regiments (see British Vehicle Note 52). The Lynx was used by Canadian units, and by British and Indian troops in the PTO.</p>

Humber Scout Car: </span>Another vehicle built to help meet the demand for scout cars was the Humber. It was less mechanically sophisticated than the Daimler and had thinner armor. On the other hand, its roomier crew compartment enabled it to carry a passenger, so it was commonly used as a liaison vehicle—e.g., in HQ units, and in the intercommunication troop of 9-12 SC authorized in mid 1943 to each tank battalion and each armoured, armoured recce, and AC regiment. It was also used by the RAF Regiment, especially in the PTO. 4,300 Humber Scout Cars were built.</p>

Stuart Recce:</span> Some British units using Stuart tanks as recon vehicles removed their turrets and fitted pintle-mounted MG. This was done to make them lighter, faster and less conspicuous. These conversions were dubbed Stuart Recces and, aside from their reconnaissance role, were occasionally used as command vehicles and APCs. In the PTO the Stuart remained an effective gun tank, so it is doubtful that such conversions were as common there. Since Stuart Recces were nonstandard field-workshop modifications of whichever Stuart models were available, the game piece is generic, representing a typically converted Stuart III.</p>
<p>†The MA may be fired only at a target that lies within this AFV's VCA— as signified by &quot;MA: VCA only&quot; on the counter. The MA is treated as a single weapon for malfunction/repair purposes, but is treated as two LMG for Scrounging purposes.</p>

Humber III &amp; Otter Light Reconnaissance Cars:</span> The Humber LRC evolved from one of the many expedient wheeled-AFV designs rushed into production in the summer of 1940. The Mk III (and the equivalent Mk IIIA) consisted of a modified Humber 4x4 8-cwt truck with a lightly armored body and a turreted Bren LMG. The Otter was its equivalent as built by General Motors of Canada. LRC were rather unsophisticated recon vehicles compared to purpose-built SC but, being much simpler designs, were less expensive to build and easier to maintain. They were standard equipment in the infantry division's recce regiment (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#51" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 51</a>). In addition they were employed in ones and twos for scouting and liaison in engineer units (in which role each carried a recce boat— equivalent in game terms to a one-boat Small Raft), and were also used by the RAF Regiment. 3,600 Humbers and 1,761 Otters were built.</p>
<p>†Humber III LRC non-PTO RF is 1.4 prior to 7/43, 1.3 for 7-12/43, and 1.2 thereafter; PTO Dates and RF are 12/43-45 (1.5). Otter non-PTO RF is 1.6 for 4-6/43, 1.5 for 7/43-5/44, and 1.4 thereafter; India-Burma Dates and RF are 12/43-45 (1.6).</p>

In May 1940, 38 equipped the 12th Lancers in France (the only AC regiment with the BEF), with three per troop; by the end of that month, all 38 had been lost. The 11th Hussars in Egypt received 30 Morris AC in 1939, and used them as HQ and troop leaders' vehicles (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#47" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 47</a>).</p>
<p>†As used in Belgium and France this AFV had a coaxial LMG, which in North Africa was repositioned as an AAMG. Therefore, the counter has two sets of MG FP factors: &quot;Fr: -/2&quot; and &quot;NAf: -/-/2&quot;. The former is used in scenarios set in Belgium/France; the latter, those set in North Africa.</p>

The game piece is representative of the 34 1920- and 1924-Pattern cars used by the 11th Hussars, who modified them by replacing the standard Vickers MG turret with an open-top type carrying an ATR, LMG and smoke discharger. These saw action against the Italians in the initial phase of the desert war.

Marmon-Herrington II ME, III ME &amp; III MFF Armoured Cars:</span> At the start of WW2, after being informed that Britain could not meet their AC requirements, the South Africans undertook the production of a domestically designed armored car. Its 4x2 Ford truck chassis was supplied by Canada, the armament by Britain, and the armor by South African industry. After the first 135 had been built, production switched to a 4x4 model using a conversion kit supplied by the U.S. Marmon-Herrington Co. The British contracted for a number of the 4x4 type, stipulating that each be equipped with an ATR, LMG, and an AA Vickers MG in lieu of the original armament of one Vickers. This version they named the Marmon-Herrington II, and the South Africans added the suffix ME (&quot;Middle East&quot;) to distinguish it from the original-armament type which they designated MFF (&quot;Mobile Field Force&quot;). 338 ME and 549 MFF Mk II were built, with the former going to North Africa and the latter retained for use elsewhere. In May 1941 the Mk III entered production, featuring improvements derived from its predecessors' use in combat; 798 ME and 1,780 MFF Mk III were built, with about one-third of the latter going to India, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies. While unsophisticated in design, lightly armored and poorly armed, Marmon-Herringtons (or South African Reconnaissance Cars, as the South Africans themselves designated them) were unfailingly reliable and proved a valuable asset to the Allies in 1941-42. Indeed, of the four British AC regiments that operated mainly in North Africa, only one (the 12th Lancers) was not completely equipped with the &quot;Monkey-Harry&quot; at some time during that period. In addition, South Africa's contribution to the desert war included two AC regiments and two divisional recce battalions, all of which employed Marmon-Herringtons throughout their tours of duty there. Besides North Africa, ME types also saw action in Syria, East Africa and Madagascar. The Union of South Africa ultimately produced 5,746 Marmon-Herringtons during WW2 (including the Mks IV-VII which saw no combat). Prior to mid 1943, an AC troop comprised three armored cars.</p>
<p>†Marmon-Herrington II ME Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 2-3/41 (1.4), 4/41 (1.3), 5-10/41 (1.2), and 11-12/41 (1.4); for use in East Africa they are 2-11/41 (1.3); for use in Syria they are 6-7/41 (1.3).

Marmon-Herrington IIv &amp; IIIv Armoured Cars: </span>From their very first clash with German armored cars it was apparent that Marmon-Herringtons needed heavier armament. Though the Mks II and III never had better weapons installed at the factory, authorization was soon granted in North Africa to replace the turret on some vehicles with captured Italian 20mm AA guns. Later, various AT weapons such as the German 37mm, Italian 47mm and British 2pdr were also fitted—but these modifications were not officially authorized. In late 1941 such variants averaged about one per Marmon-Herrington squadron; by late 1942 they averaged about one per troop.

Humber II &amp; III Armoured Cars:</span> The Humber AC, based on a Quad FAT (field artillery tractor), was an intermediate step between the crude pre-war AC and the more mechanically sophisticated Daimler Armoured Car. The Humber II had a two-man turret, but in the Mk III this was replaced by a larger, three-man version. In North Africa, Humbers were first used by the 11th Hussars and 12th Lancers; later in that theater, several other AC regiments and the RAF Regiment also received them. With some 5,300 of all Marks produced, Humbers were numerically the most important British-built AC of WW2.</p>

In the ETO, Humbers were generally found in the squadron and regimental HQs of AC regiments, as well as in the various HQ units of other armored formations. In the PTO, Humber IV's were used by the 1st Indian Light Cavalry Regiment. From late 1942, Humber AC were most often employed in the recce regiments of infantry divisions, in which a scout troop typically comprised one Humber AC as the troop HQ, a recce section of two car-patrols (each with one Humber AC and one Humber LRC), and two carrier sections containing a total of seven Carriers.</p>

Hence both vehicles had many similar design characteristics, though in certain respects the AC was even more sophisticated (e.g., in having a rear-facing steering wheel for the vehicle commander to use in an emergency). The Daimler's firepower was a great improvement over earlier British AC designs as well, for it carried the turret of the Tetrarch light tank whose 2pdr gun put it on a par with the Cruiser and Infantry tanks of the 1940-41 period. Unfortunately, Daimler AC production was seriously delayed several times by Luftwaffe bombing raids, and it was not until mid 1942 that they finally entered combat. In the desert they were used by the King's Dragoon Guards and the Royal Dragoons, usually with one Daimler and two Marmon-Herrington or Humber AC per troop. In Tunisia, several additional AC regiments arrived with or received Daimlers. At the conclusion of the North African campaign the organization of AC regiments was changed; thereafter an AC troop comprised two AC and two SC, both types usually being Daimlers. Daimler AC were used in India-Burma by the 11th (Prince Albert Victor's Own) Cavalry. 2,694 were built, and the type remained in service until about 1960.</p>

AEC Armoured Cars:</span> The AEC, an unsolicited design put forth by the Associated Equipment Co., Ltd. (the producer of London's double-decker buses), was a heavy AC—in effect the wheeled equivalent of a tank—derived from the AEC Matador MAT (medium artillery tractor). The Army, having no requirement for such a large and slow AC, initially rejected it— but Churchill personally intervened, and eventually the AEC I went into production. This model carried the turret and main armament of the Valentine II. Late in the North African campaign a small number were issued to certain AC regiments as heavy support vehicles, but apparently were then withdrawn from frontline service after the Axis collapse in Tunisia. The Mk II, which featured increased horsepower and a new three-man turret with 6pdr gun, seems to have been produced in very small numbers—though as many as 24 were supplied to the Yugoslav Partisans in late 1944. The Mk III, the final and most widely used model, was essentially a Mk II with the British 75mm gun. By virtue of its armor and potent, fully traversable MA, it was the most powerful AC of the war. AEC III were used in the same way as M3 GMC (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#58" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 58</a>), but apparently none were used in Italy. Total AEC production amounted to 629 vehicles, including 122 of the Mk I. AEC were sometimes referred to as &quot;Junies&quot; or &quot;Matadors&quot;.</p>

Staghound I(a) &amp; II(a) Armoured Cars: </span>The Staghound was the U.S. T17E1, built by Chevrolet. It was large and quite heavy for an AC but, being intended for use in the desert, its size and weight were not considered liabilities. Around the end of 1942 it was about to be cancelled due to the plethora of AC then under development, but the British requested that production be continued for their use. Ultimately 2,844 Staghound I were built, all of which were supplied to Britain and the Commonwealth. The British modified some by installing the 76mm close-support howitzer, thus creating the Mk II (or Staghound CS as it was also known). Staghounds were not well liked by their users, who considered them too large and unwieldy for the narrow streets and lanes of Europe. Nevertheless they found a standard role in AC regiments, with three in the regimental HQ and three more in each squadron HQ. In Italy, Staghounds were also used by the 2nd New Zealand Divisional Cavalry Regiment and by the RAF Regiment.

Bishop:</span> In mid 1941 a request was made for a SP version of the 25pdr, which was being used increasingly as an AT gun in the desert. The resulting vehicle utilized the sturdy Valentine tank chassis with a tall, rather crude superstructure for the gun. The Bishop, though mechanically reliable, was not well thought of by its users who found it to be slow yet conspicuously large, with a cramped interior and very little inherent gun traverse (the latter a significant handicap in the AT role). Fortunately, by the time it became available the 6pdr AT was being issued, so the Bishop was used as SPA. But even in this role it proved unsatisfactory, for its MA was so restricted in elevation that its maximum range was less than half that of the towed 25pdr. Bishops saw action with SP field regiments of the Royal Artillery in North Africa, Sicily and Italy before being declared obsolete in Oct. 1944. Only 100 were built since, soon after production had begun, the British decided to use the Priest in the SPA role.</p>

Priest(a): </span>This was the U.S. M7 HMC. The British requested it in early 1942 but were told that U.S.requirements had first priority. However, when Rommel's forces entered Egypt that summer, 90 were shipped to the 8th Army, the first batch arriving in September. 24 Priests equipped the 11th Royal Horse Artillery in the 1st Armoured Division during the second battle of Alamein—the vehicle's first use in combat. Thereafter, a number of 8th Army field and RHA regiments in Tunisia, Sicily and Italy used Priests, with most eventually being replaced by Sextons. For the Normandy landings, each of the three infantry divisions (3rd and 50th British, and 3rd Canadian) making the initial assault had its three field regiments completely equipped with Priests, as did the 19th Canadian Army Field Regiment in the 1st Canadian Army. In July and August of that year all the former were converted to towed 25pdrs and the latter to Sextons. In the PTO, Priests were used in Burma by the 18th Field Regiment. 828 M7 HMC were Lend-Leased to the British, who named them &quot;Priests&quot; because of their pulpit-like AAMG mount.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa, Sicily and Italy are 10/42-5/43 (1.5), 6-12/43 (1.4), 1-9/44 (1.3), 10-12/44 (1.4), and 1.5 in 1945. For use in France they are 6-7/44 (1.3) and 8/44 (1.5). For use in Burma they are 11/44-45 and 1.3.</p>

What was needed was a well-designed SP 25pdr, but at the time neither the British nor the Americans felt able to undertake production of a new vehicle. The solution to this problem was found in Canada, where the Ram tank (which, like the Priest, used the chassis and mechanical components of the U.S. M3 Medium) was being produced. Carrying only a 6pdr gun, the Ram by late 1942 was fast becoming obsolete, and early that year the Canadians had begun experimenting with a SP 25pdr variant to equip the artillery battalions of their armoured divisions. The fact that 25pdrs were already being manufactured in Canada was an added plus, for it assured a steady supply of guns. This variant carried the 25pdr in an open-top non-turreted fighting compartment similar to that of the Priest, and the new vehicle, named Sexton by the British, entered production in early 1943. By late 1945 when it ended, 2,150 had been built. Sextons were employed in Royal Horse Artillery and SP field regiments, both non-divisional and those organic to armoured divisions. They eventually replaced most of the Priests being used in the SPA role, and remained in British service until the late 1950s. A troop of full-tracked SPA comprised four such AFV, plus in 1944-45 a Ram (for a Sexton troop) or Sherman (for a Priest troop) OP tank (see <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.46" class="topiclink">H1.46</a>).</p>

M3 GMC(a) Halftrack:</span> As M10 GMC became available in U.S. TD battalions, many of the M3 GMC they replaced were turned over to the British. Their new owners designated them the &quot;75mm SP, Autocar&quot; and issued them to the newly reorganized AC regiments, wherein two M3 (plus a SC) formed the heavy troop of an AC squadron (though in some cases they were grouped together to form a regimental battery of eight such vehicles). A few were used thusly in Tunisia, but most went into action later in Sicily and Italy. A relatively small number were employed in NWE, probably with AC units transferred from the Mediterranean Theater. A few sources state that they were also used in a support role in some infantry recce regiments and tank squadrons—but such use was probably quite rare.</p>

Though it was capable of putting out an impressive amount of firepower for a short time, the tank commander in the one-man turret had too many duties; as a result it was not a very effective AA weapon.

They were based on the Centaur and Crusader, with the normal turret replaced by one mounting a 40mm Bofors gun (thus creating the Crusader AA Mk I), twin 20mm guns (the Crusader AA Mk II and Centaur AA Mk I), or twin 20mm guns and a CMG (the Crusader AA Mk III and Centaur AA Mk II). The Crusader AA Mk I was issued to AA regiments, but was withdrawn shortly after the Normandy landings due to the lack of Luftwaffe targets. The Crusader AA Mks II and III (both of which are represented by the game piece), and the Centaur AA tanks as well, were issued to armoured regiments and tank battalions, with a troop of four authorized to the HQ of each such unit.

Humber AA &amp; Staghound AA (a) Armoured Cars:</span> The Humber AA was a Humber Mk I or Mk II AC with its normal turret replaced by the same type used on the Mk VI AA light tank. The Staghound AA was the U.S. T17E2 AC, which comprised a normal Staghound (U.S. T17E1) with its turret replaced by one mounting twin .50-cal MG. 1000 Staghound AA were built at the request of the British. Both types of AA AC were used in AC regiments, with four authorized to the regimental HQ. In addition, from September 1942 through November 1943 the HQ of an armoured brigade was authorized two AA AC, as was the HQ of a tank brigade.

M5(a), M5A1(a), M9(a) &amp; M9A1(a) Halftracks:</span> These were U.S. halftracks built by the International Harvester Co. Considered non-standard, they were consigned to Lend-Lease stocks, and most went to Britain where they were designated &quot;Truck, 15-cwt, Half-Tracked, Personnel&quot;. The British used them as command vehicles, prime movers for AT guns (mostly the 17pdr), and as engineer/pioneer vehicles. Another important role was as an APC for the infantry sections in motor battalions—mostly those employed in NWE. When equipped with halftracks, a motor battalion was the functional equivalent of a U.S. armored infantry battalion. In game terms a 1944-45 motor platoon with halftracks contained four such AFV; three carrying a squad apiece, and the fourth carrying the platoon leader plus two HS, a PIAT and a 2-in. mortar. One thusly organized platoon was also found in each fighting squadron of an AC regiment, and in each recce squadron of an infantry division's recce regiment; however, it was termed a support troop in the former and an assault troop in the latter. Having one or more MG mounted on the halftrack seems to have been more the exception than the rule—and even when present such armament varied from vehicle to vehicle, so in this respect the game pieces are strictly generic. The British were Lend-Leased 5,690 M5 and M5A1 halftracks out of the 7,584 built, plus a large portion of the 3,433 M9 and M9A1 produced. In addition they were supplied with 1,600 M14 halftracks (M5 types that mounted twin .50-cal MG with 360° traverse), most of which they converted to APC.</p>

Carriers A, B &amp; C</span>: The tracked armored carrier was by far the most common &quot;AFV&quot; in British service. Originally designed to transport the Vickers MG, by late 1939 three different types had evolved: the Bren, Cavalry, and Scout Carrier. Their primary function was to increase the mobility and protection of LMG and ATR crews in infantry, cavalry light tank, and divisional cavalry units respectively. A fourth type, the Armoured OP Carrier, was in development for artillery forward observers. Then in 1940 the Universal Carrier (often generically— but erroneously—referred to as the Bren Carrier) appeared, featuring one basic design which with minor modifications could fill any of these roles. This is the version the Carrier A-C pieces represent, though in some cases their initial Dates actually reflect combat use of the earlier models. (The Universal Carrier was first used in North Africa.) Carriers A and B were most commonly found in the carrier platoon of the infantry battalion and in the scout platoon of the motor infantry company. Both platoons had the same general functions: reconnaissance, direct support, flank protection and mobile reserve. The carrier platoon had 10 Carriers in 1939-40, increased to 13 around 1943. The scout platoon comprised 10-11 Carriers. In both, a section officially comprised one Carrier A (or C), one Carrier B and one 2-in. mortar Carrier. Carriers were also used in the scout troops of the infantry division's recce regiment; see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#51" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 51</a>. They were also employed as command, liaison and artillery observer vehicles. In 1943 a towing attachment was added so that in emergencies they could tow 6pdrs a short distance; however, it seems their use as towing vehicles became a fairly common practice. The Carrier C piece represents a Carrier A uparmed with a &quot;privately obtained&quot; MG. About 100,000 Universal Carriers and related types (Bren, Scout, etc.) were built inclusive of all variants, coming from (in descending order of overall production totals) Britain, Canada, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. 57 Carriers were used by U.S. forces during the defense of the Philippines in 1941-42. They arrived at Manila on 12 Dec. 1941 en route from Vancouver to Hong Kong, and were released by the Canadian government a few days later. They had no armament, but were quickly provided with .30 &amp; .50 cal. MG. 40 were allotted to the Provisional Tank Group while the remainder went to the scout car section of the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Horse) (Philippine Scouts).</p>
<p><img src="britv084.jpg" width="82" height="78" alt="BritV084" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />†The Carrier A's 2 FP BMG MA may be repositioned as a normal MA AAMG. This can be done only by placing an AA counter on the Carrier at the end of any friendly fire phase (not MPh) in which the BMG has not fired and the Inherent MMC is not stunned, shocked, broken or in Melee. As long as the AA counter remains on the Carrier, its FP is assumed to be &quot;—/ —/2&quot; with a zero Multiple ROF. The AAMG may be repositioned as the BMG MA by using these same principles to remove the AA counter.</p>
<p>†The Carrier C's MA may not be Removed, as signified by &quot;Rmvl NA&quot; on the counter, and may be Scrounged only as a British LMG.

During the war the British also produced a Vickers-MG Carrier, but this version had the weapon mounted on a pedestal on the engine cover, thus allowing an all-round field of fire.

In 1943 this fitting was made standard on all new Carriers so they could be easily field-converted to this role. It seems that in combat the mortar was rarely fired from the vehicle, the crew usually dismounting instead to fire it from the ground where they were less conspicuous. When available, one 2-in. mortar Carrier was included in each Carrier section (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#64" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 64</a>).

Priest (a) &amp; Ram Kangaroos:</span> The idea for these APC originated with the Canadians in Normandy. The initial type used was derived from the Priest, which was chosen simply because those in the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had just been replaced by Sextons and were near at hand. An ad hoc workshop detachment code-named &quot;Kangaroo&quot; removed the guns and ammo bins from 76 Priests and plated over their gun apertures. The modified vehicles, at first referred to as &quot;Unfrocked Priests&quot;, were used successfully just a few days later during Operation Totalize, the initial drive on Falaise, carrying the 4th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division and the 152nd Infantry Brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division. But since Priests were in limited supply, the Ram (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#57" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 57</a>), of which there were many in Britain, was chosen as the standard conversion vehicle. A Ram became a Kangaroo by having its turret removed and the interior stowage altered to provide room for the passengers. The 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment was formed, and first used its Ram Kangaroos in the assault on Boulogne. The British too formed a Kangaroo unit, the 49th APC Regiment, and at the end of 1944 both formations became part of the 79th Armoured Division which used them on numerous occasions to provide assault transport for infantry battalions. Kangaroos were also employed in Italy, where in late 1944 and early 1945 102 Priests and 75 Shermans (which as Kangaroos are equivalent to Rams in game terms) were converted, and were operated by the 4th and 14th/20th Hussars. De-turreted Rams and Shermans were sometimes used in NWE and Italy respectively for towing 17pdr AT in armored units. A section of Kangaroos comprised three such AFV, and could transport one infantry platoon.</p>

Wasp &amp; Badger(a):</span> The Wasp was a Carrier with a FT mounted in place of the BMG. Two different types were used in action: the Mk II, which carried the flame-fuel and propellant tanks inside the vehicle; and the Canadian-designed Mk IIC, which had only a single flame-fuel tank that was mounted on the rear exterior, thus allowing an extra crewman to be carried. For simplicity the game piece generically represents both types. By 1945 the Mk IIC had replaced the Mk II in NWE. A Wasp platoon (which comprised six such AFV and was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ronson Cavalry&quot;), was part of the support company in many infantry battalions by 1945. In some cases the motor battalion and/or independent MG company in an armoured division also had a platoon.</p>
<p>The Badger was a Ram Kangaroo converted by the Canadians to carry the Wasp FT. The flame gun replaced the Ram's BMG, and its associated equipment was stowed in the vehicle's interior. Badgers were used in action by the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade in NWE.</p>

Buffalo Mk II(a) &amp; Mk IV(a):</span> These were the U.S. LVT2 and LVT4 respectively. Most used in British service were only partially armored, but many were uparmed with a 20mm gun. In NWE they were under command of the 79th Armoured Division, and were first committed to action with the 5th Assault Regiment Royal Engineers and the 11th RTR during the operations around the Scheldt estuary. By 1945 some 600 were available, and they figured prominently in the battle of the Reichswald and the crossing of the Rhine. Near the war's end Buffaloes were also used in Italy, being referred to as Fantails in that theater. In the PTO, U.S.-type LVT were used by the Australians during their assault landings on Borneo.

Sherman III DD(a):</span> The DD (Duplex Drive) amphibious tank was a British invention. Tested first in 1941 on a Tetrarch tank, the system was then installed on more than 600 Valentines. But by mid 1943 Valentines were obsolete, and it was decided that Shermans would be converted to the DD role for combat operations. For the Normandy landings—the initial combat use of Sherman DD—the British employed three armoured regiments: the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards (all of whose Sherman DD were ship-landed on the beach), the 13th/18th Hussars (34 launched, of which 3 sank; at least 5 ship-landed); and the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (all ship-landed). In addition, the Canadians used two DD-equipped armoured regiments in the D-Day landings: the 6th (29 launched, of which 8 sank; 6 or more ship-landed) and the 10th (all ship-landed). Each regiment actually contained only two squadrons of DD Shermans; the third squadron, whose Shermans were equipped only for deep-wading, but which alone in the regiment had an allotment of Sherman Fireflies, landed later with the second wave of infantry. The plan for the British and Canadian beaches on D-Day was to have the Sherman DD land first, followed several minutes later by AVRE and Sherman Crabs arriving in LCTs (Landing Craft, Tank), with the first infantry assault companies hitting the beach shortly thereafter. However, due to much of the DD wave being delayed by the rough seas, the AVRE and Crabs were the first tanks ashore in many sectors and found themselves having to engage the AT guns that the DD Shermans were to have dealt with. Later in NWE DD Shermans were used by the Staffordshire Yeomanry in the Scheldt operations and the crossing of the Elbe, and by the 44th RTR during the Rhine crossing. In Italy Sherman DD were used by the 7th Hussars. Apparently 573 Sherman DD were built by the British during the war—all of them being Mks III and V. DD tanks were a closely guarded secret; in fact, their existence was not officially made public until after the war. For details on the functioning of the DD system see footnote <a href="chd_chdfootnotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">D13</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#48" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 48</a>.</p>

This short age did not occur, so Terrapins were used by the 79th Armoured Division to ferry men and material in support of amphibious assaults. The Terrapin was an 8x8 vehicle, but on a hard surface only the four center wheels touched the ground. When in the water each of its two engines drove a propeller. It was generally considered inferior to the DUKW for several reasons: the driver, who was situated in the center of the vehicle, had a very limited view; instead of one large cargo hold it had two smaller ones fore and aft of the driver; and it had a rigid (i.e., no) suspension, which severely limited its land speed. On the other hand, while the DUKW's payload was 5,000 lbs., that of the Terrapin was about 9,000 lbs. 500 Terrapins were built, and were first used during the Scheldt operations.

The solution to this problem was to mount the gun unlimbered on the bed of a truck specially modified for this purpose, the result being called the 2pdr Portee. This arrangement both saved wear and tear on the gun and increased its mobility. Consequently the Portee became the standard method of transporting the 2pdr in North Africa. In theory the gun was to be unloaded before engaging the enemy, but the rapid movements necessitated by oft-open flanks and highly mobile tank warfare dictated otherwise; more often than not the gunners fought right from the Portees even though their conspicuousness inevitably caused them heavy casualties. On the attack, Portees usually reversed into action so the gunshield could provide some protection for the driver. Aside from North Africa, 2pdr Portees fought in other areas including Greece, Syria and Burma. A troop in an AT regiment comprised four such vehicles.</p>
<p>†This truck starts each scenario Inherently carrying (not towing) a 40L AT. While thusly mounted, the 40L serves as the Portee's MA and is treated as a T Gun [EXC: it may not fire at a target that lies within the Portee's VCA—as signified by &quot;NA VCA&quot; on the counter]. The gunshield provides no protection for the Portee, but Direct (only) Fire attacks vs it which emanate from within its TCA, and which do not destroy it, affect its crew as if they were manning a non-Emplaced, non-vehicular AT.</p>
<p>†The crew (see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhmultibritvehnotes.htm#h" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note H</a>) Abandons and re-enters the 2pdr Portee as per <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.4" class="topiclink">D5.4-.43</a>. However, the Gun can be unloaded only after a crew counter in the Gun's Location has spent its entire MF allotment as unpinned, non-entrenched Good Order Infantry in a declared attempt (which makes it subject to Hazardous Movement) to do so. If this has been accomplished, the Gun is considered unloaded and takes counter form in Limbered mode, and it, the crew and Portee (which is flipped over to its unarmed side) become TI. The crew and Gun are loaded aboard the Portee using these same principles; however, a Gun may not be (un)loaded onto/from any Portee that has expended MP in the same MPh. A voluntarily Abandoned 2pdr Portee retains an Inherent Driver.</p>

Loyd Carrier:</span> This vehicle was designed to transport an infantry section or weapon crew, and to tow a light gun such as the 2pdr AT. For several years it saw limited service, but only as a personnel carrier since the portee doctrine called for AT guns to be carried on trucks. With the demise of the portee in 1943, however, the Loyd was adopted as the standard towing vehicle for the 6pdr AT and 4.2-in. MTR, in which role it served for the remainder of the war. The design allowed for armor plates to be attached, but apparently they were rarely fitted. About 26,000 were built, and were used in all theaters.</p>

A number of different models were produced by several manufacturers, but all are equivalent in game terms. Later versions were used to tow the 17pdr AT as well, and the game piece also represents other vehicles converted to tow the 17pdr. By war's end some 28,000 Quads had been built in Britain and Canada. The basic Quad chassis was utilized in numerous other softskin vehicles and wheeled AFV.</p>
<p>†Although the Quad is not an AFV and has a cs# rather than a CS#, any Effects Final DR vs it receives a -1 DRM for Burning Wreck determination (only).</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for non-PTO use are 4/40 (1.5), 5/40 (1.3 for France and Belgium; 1.5 for Norway), 6-11/40 (1.2), and 12/40-5/45 (1.1) [EXC: 1.5 for 5/41 use on Crete]. For PTO use they are 12/41-45 (1.3).</p>

The majority were lost in France in 1940, but by the end of the war over 230,000 were in British service. Most were built in Britain, but a large number were produced in Canada which also shipped chassis to Australia, India, South Africa, etc. for final assembly in those countries. One of the British Army's most common vehicles, the 15-cwt truck could be found in nearly every type of unit. It was used mainly as a supply and load-carrying vehicle, but in motor battalions (and in the assault troops of infantry recce regiments) each section was transported in a 15-cwt until the halftrack and White SC replaced it. In regular infantry battalions each platoon had one 15-cwt for carrying the men's gear. Some of the most common types were the Guy Ant, Bedford MW, Morris CSS, and the Canadian Ford F15 and Chevrolet CIS series, &quot;cwt&quot; stands for &quot;hundredweight&quot; (112 lbs).</p>
<p>†Non-PTO RF is .9 through 6/41 [EXC: 1.4 for 4-5/40 use in Norway and 5/41 use on Crete] and 1.0 thereafter. PTO RF is .9 through 5/43 and 1.2 thereafter.</p>

Production continued in Britain and commenced in Canada, and 4x4 models were introduced, but later in the war output was curtailed in favor of the 3-tonner. The 4x4 30-cwt was sometimes used as a prime mover for the 18pdr, 25pdr and 4.5-in. howitzer—especially in Australian units. Some common 30-cwt lorries were the Bedford OX, Austin K2 and K30, and the Canadian Ford F30 and Chevrolet C30 series.</p>
<p>†Non-PTO RF is 1.0 through 6/41 [EXC: 1.5 for 4-5/40 use in Norway and 5/41 use on Crete], 1.1 for 7/41-8/42, 1.2 for 9/42-5/43, 1.3 for 6-12/43, 1.4 for 1-5/44, and 1.5 thereafter. PTO RF is is 1.1 through 5/42, 1.2 for 6/42-5/43, 1.3 for 6-11/43, and 1.5 thereafter.</p>

From slightly less than 10,000 4x2 and 6x4 types in 1939, use of the 3-ton lorry increased to the point that by VE Day about 390,000 were in service with the British alone. 4x4 models entered production at the end of 1940, and were the types usually found in the forward areas; e.g., one 3-tonner was the standard method of transport for an infantry platoon. Specially adapted versions were used to tow the Bofors AA gun and to carry the 6pdr AT enportee, and the game piece also represents the AEC Matador MAT (medium artillery tractor) which towed the 6-in. howitzer, 4.5-in. gun and 5.5-in. gun-howitzer. Large numbers of 4x2 3-ton lorries were supplied to the USSR. Some common 3-ton models were the Austin K3 and K5, Bedford OY and QL, and the Canadian Ford F60L and Chevrolet C60L series.</p>
<p>†Non-PTO RF is 1.1 through 6/41 [EXC: 1.5 for 4-5/40 use in Norway and 5/41 use on Crete] and .9 thereafter. PTO RF is .9 through 5/43 and 1.1 thereafter.</p>

Jeep(a):</span> In British service the Jeep, or &quot;Car, 5-cwt, 4x4&quot;, became almost as common as in U.S. service. It began appearing in North Africa as a command and liaison vehicle in the first half of 1942. As its availability increased, so too did its roles. The recce squadrons in some infantry recce regiments had a six-vehicle Jeep troop, apparently added in late 1942. In January 1943 a three-Jeep recce troop was authorized for each AC squadron in North Africa, but was deleted shortly after the capture of Tunisia. By 1944 the company commanders in infantry and motor battalions had a Jeep as personal transport, with the total number of Jeeps in these battalions being 15 and 6 respectively. Jeeps were vital to the airborne divisions, constituting practically all their front line transport and recon vehicles, as well as towing heavy weapons such as the 6pdr, 20mm AA and 75mm pack howitzer. In the jungles of the Southwest Pacific, Jeeps became the most widely used vehicles in Australian units as they were often the only type of vehicle able to operate anywhere near the front line.</p>
<p>†The Jeep has Low Ground Pressure (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">D1.41</a>). Moreover, when it is bogged, one (only) CX squad (even a Prisoner—but not a Guard) on foot expending a four MF in the vehicle's Location (and declared to be assisting its unbogging) thereby allows the owning player to subtract two (one per crew/HS) from the colored dr of its immediately subsequent unbogging DR. [ERRATA: Apply the change incorporated in the preceding sentence to German, Russian and U.S. Vehicle Notes L as well.]</p>
<p>†RF is 1.5 through 9/42, 1.4 for 10/42-5/43, 1.2 for 6-8/43, 1.1 for 9-11/43, and 1.0 thereafter.</p>

U.S. Trucks:</span> The British Empire/Commonwealth was Lend-Leased 292,256 U.S. trucks, making it second only to the USSR in the number supplied. The breakdown was 127,755 trucks of ≤ 1-ton capacity (including Jeeps), 97,112 of the 1½- to 2-ton class, 26,898 2½-tonners, and 40,491 of &gt; 2½-tons. The 1½-ton and 2½-ton trucks supplemented the British 30-cwt and 3-ton lorries respectively. The 7½-tonners were used to tow heavy artillery just as in U.S. service. Canadian auto manufacturers, most of which were subsidiaries of U.S. companies, produced 815,729 softskin transport vehicles during the war, with the vast majority of them going to the British also.</p>
<p>7½ -Ton Truck RF is 1.6 prior to, and 1.5 in, 1945.</p>
