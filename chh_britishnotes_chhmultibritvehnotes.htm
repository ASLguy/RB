<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> Non-MG MA uses red To Hit numbers prior to 1944—as signified on applicable counters by &quot;RED TH#s (pre 44)&quot;. When present, &quot;(a)&quot; in the &nbsp;piece &nbsp;name &nbsp;stands &nbsp;for &nbsp;&quot;American&quot; &nbsp; for &nbsp;ESB &nbsp;(<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">D2.5</a>), &nbsp;Scrounging/ Removal (see <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a>), Hammada Immobilization (<a href="chf_chf3.htm#3.31" class="topiclink">F3.31</a>) and Sand Bog (<a href="chf_chf7.htm#7.31" class="topiclink">F7.31</a>) purposes.</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B. </span> The 4-FP CMG is &quot;standard equipment&quot;, but can be replaced by the optional 6-FP version as per <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">H1.41</a>. RF for the 6-FP CMG is as follows— A10 Mk IA: 1.5 in France, NA elsewhere; A13 Mk II and Matilda II: 1.1 in France, 1.4 elsewhere; Matilda I: 1.3. The BPV of each of these AFV assumes the presence of the 4-FP CMG; add two points if the 6-FP version is used.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C. </span> 37mm canister has 12 FP, but is available only in 1944-45—as may be signified by the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">4+</span>&quot;. Printed canister Depletion numbers are increased by three for use in the PTO; e.g., &quot;C7&quot; becomes &quot;C10&quot; when used in the PTO. For the Lee and Grant medium tanks, canister is available only to the 37LL MA. Non-depletable HE (i.e., with no Depletion number) becomes available for the 37LL MA in 1944, as signified by &quot;HE<span class="f_Exponent">4+</span>&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D.</span> The vehicle's high hull made exit and entry difficult for Personnel who had to climb over the sides. Therefore, the cost to (un)load (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">D6.4-.5</a>) is doubled to ½ of the vehicle's MP allotment and two MF for the Personnel—as signified by &quot;(un)load x 2&quot; on the counter [EXC: normal costs apply to the Buffalo Mk IV(a)]. In addition, all attacks made by the Passengers of this vehicle are halved (or receive a +2 TH DRM) as Mounted Fire (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>). This vehicle may retain any unpossessed SW aboard it (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">D6.4</a>), but its crew may not Remove its MG.</p>
<p><a id="e"></a><span class="f_Strong">E. </span>The optional BMG may fire while the vehicle is HD across its VCA— as signified by &quot;HD FP ok&quot; on the counter. It is always available and has a 1.2 RF.</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.</span> &nbsp;Maximum range of this AFV's 12.7mm MA is 16 hexes for To Hit purposes (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.61" class="topiclink">A9.61</a>)—as signified by &quot;[16] TH&quot; on the counter. Even though the IFE FP actually comprises more than one MG, it is treated as a single weapon for malfunction/repair purposes. The MA may not be Scrounged or Removed—as signified by &quot;MA Rmvl NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G.</span> &nbsp;May be equipped with a Gyrostabilizer as per <a href="chd_chd11.htm" class="topiclink">D11</a>.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><img src="britcrew.gif" width="59" height="60" alt="britcrew" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">H. </span>As signified by &quot;Inf Crew'' on the counter, this vehicle starts each scenario manned by an Inherent Infantry (i.e., 2-2-8) crew [<span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> This is also true of the German SPW 250/7 and SPW 251/2, and of the U.S. M4, M4A1 and M21 MC halftracks (which have a 2-2-7)]. When such a crew exits its vehicle its ID should be recorded since it differs from a normal Infantry crew by having vehicular-crew capabilities.</p>
<p><a id="i"></a><span class="f_Strong">I.</span> The optional MA is a U.S. .50-cal HMG (as signified by &quot;MA: 12.7(a)&quot; on the counter) if it has a &quot;2&quot; ROF, or a U.S. .30-cal MMG (as signified by &quot;MA: MMG(a)&quot; on the counter) if it has a &quot;1&quot; ROF, and may be Removed (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>) as such (i.e., as a British-color 8-16 HMG or 4-10 MMG respectively; see <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a>). It is always available with a 1.3 RF. The vehicle, if armed, has an Inherent crew and thus has a CS- instead of a cs# (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>).</p>
<p><a id="j"></a><span class="f_Strong">J.</span> APDS becomes available for the 57L and 57L in June 1944, and for the 76LL in September 1944. APCR for the 76L becomes available in September 1944. These are signified by the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">J4+</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">S4+</span>&quot; where applicable.</p>
<p><a id="k"></a><span class="f_Strong">K.</span> Optional AAMG is available only after 1940, and has a 1.3 RF.</p>
<p><a id="l"></a><span class="f_Strong">L. </span>Reverse Movement costs this vehicle three times its normal hex entry cost— as signified by &quot;REV X 3&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="m"></a><span class="f_Strong">M. </span>If this AFV becomes Stunned it may not gain CE status again, may not fire its MA, and is Recalled as per <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">D5.341</a>. These are signified by &quot;Stun = Recall &amp; CE/FP NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="n"></a><span class="f_Strong">N.</span> This vehicle was used in North Africa at some time from 6/40 to 5/43 (within the limits of its own given Dates). If the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">T</span>&quot; appears, its use in North Africa was limited to Tunisia, 11/42-5/43 (within the limits of its own given Dates).</p>
<p><a id="o"></a><span class="f_Strong">O.</span> All 1MT restrictions apply in the normal manner [EXC: the crew must be CE to fire the CMG]; this is signified by &quot;BU FP NA&quot; on the counter. [<span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> The preceding sentence also applies to the German PSW 221.] Make four To Kill DR when using the MG column of the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a>; only one DR (firer's choice) is used; this is signified by &quot;4 TK DR (MG)&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="p"></a><span class="f_Strong">P.</span> This vehicle was used in the PTO at some time from 12/41 to 8/45, within the limits of its own given Dates.</p>
<p><a id="q"></a><span class="f_Strong">Q.</span> The ATR has a maximum To Hit range of 12 hexes (as signified by &quot;[12] TH&quot; on the counter) and may be Scrounged/Removed. If optional, it is always available and has a 1.1 RF. If listed as MA, it has a &quot;1&quot; Multiple ROF. If it is a TATR, it fires through the TCA in the normal manner. If it is a SA BATR, it may fire while the vehicle is BU and/or HD across its VCA—as signified on the counter by &quot;BU/HD FP ok&quot; (or &quot;HD FP ok&quot; for the Carrier, MMG A, which cannot be BU). The MA BATR of the IP Carrier Mk IIB may fire while the vehicle is BU, as signified by &quot;BU FP ok&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="r"></a><span class="f_Strong">R. </span>This AFV had a very fast and accurate turret traverse, and also a better-than-normal ROF for a MA of its caliber. Therefore, it is allowed the possibility of Multiple Hits (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.8" class="topiclink">C3.8</a>) even though its MA is &gt; 40mm. Moreover, in a Gun Duel (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.2401" class="topiclink">C2.2401</a>) its total Firer-based TH DRM are halved (FRD) prior to adding any Acquisition DRM. (The final total of all DRM may not be &lt; zero, and applies for Gun Duel calculations only.) These abilities are signified on the counter by the ROF # being printed on a white background.</p>
<p><a id="s"></a><span class="f_Strong">S.</span> The <span class="f_CorrectOverline" style="text-decoration: underline;">94</span>* can fire only Smoke—not AP or HE. Smoke fired by the <span class="f_CorrectOverline" style="text-decoration: underline;">94</span>* or <span class="f_CorrectOverline">76</span>* is not subject to <a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.9" class="topiclink">C8.9</a> Depletion, as signified by &quot;<span style="font-family: '@Arial Unicode MS';">∞</span> Smoke&quot; on the counter [EXC: the <span class="f_CorrectOverline">76</span>* of the Tetrarch CS, Matilda II CS and the Churchill I has s9 and non-depletable HE when used in a scenario set after 10/43; increase their BPV by 10 points for such use]. The <span class="f_CorrectOverline">76</span>* and <span class="f_CorrectOverline" style="text-decoration: underline;">94</span>* have a maximum range of 50 hexes—as signified by &quot;[50]&quot; on the counter. The <span class="f_CorrectOverline" style="text-decoration: underline;">94</span>* is not considered functioning ordnance for OVR purposes (<a href="chd_chd7.htm#7.11" class="topiclink">D7.11</a>), nor is the <span class="f_CorrectOverline">76</span>* if it has depleted its HE. On the Churchill I, only the <span class="f_CorrectOverline">76</span>* SA may fire Smoke and HE.</p>
<p>In an armoured regiment or tank battalion equipped with British-built tanks, the HQ of each squadron officially contained two CS tanks. Many of the early CS models could fire only smoke. Other types, which could fire HE, usually carried only a small amount of it in accordance with British tank doctrine. The later versions carried more HE and less smoke.</p>
<p><a id="t"></a><span class="f_Strong">T.</span> The AAMG, if present, may fire only at a target that lies within this AFV's &quot;rear&quot; TCA (i.e., the TCA emanating from the turret's rear Target Facing), as signified by &quot;MG: RTCA only&quot; on the counter. For the non-turreted Marmon-Herrington IIIv, the AAMG may fire in the same manner but only through the &quot;rear&quot; VCA—as signified by &quot;MG: RVCA only&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="u"></a><span class="f_Strong">U.</span> See <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.8" class="topiclink">D6.8-.84</a> for the basic rules pertaining to Carriers. If this Carrier has sD/Towing capability, it is not usable prior to 1944—as signified by the superscript(s) &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">4+</span>&quot;. If this Carrier is to start a DYO scenario as a towing vehicle, an Infantry (i.e., 2-2-8) crew may be purchased for it in lieu of its Inherent HS; this is accomplished by adding two points in the &quot;Opt BPV&quot; column of the DYO Roster's &quot;Vehicle&quot; section. The MF expenditures given in <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">C10.11</a> and <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.12" class="topiclink">C10.12</a> for (un)hooking a Gun apply unchanged if the MMC performing that action is simultaneously (un)loading from/into this Carrier. The use of &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; in the piece names are our own designations, given to help differentiate between similar models.</p>
<p><a id="v"></a><span class="f_Strong">V.</span> Of the special rules for Carriers, only <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.82" class="topiclink">D6.82-.83</a> and <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.43" class="topiclink">H1.43</a> apply to IP Carriers (and their Inherent HS/crew); for all other purposes they are considered non-Carrier wheeled OT AFV. However, this vehicle may retain any unpossessed SW aboard it (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">D6.4</a>).</p>
<p><a id="w"></a><span class="f_Strong">W.</span> WP becomes available in June 1944—as signified by the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">J4+</span>&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="x"></a><span class="f_Strong">X.</span> Reverse movement costs this vehicle four times its normal hex entry cost—as signified by &quot;REV X 4&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="y"></a><span class="f_Strong">Y.</span> HE with a Depletion number of &quot;7&quot; becomes available in February 1943, as signified by the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">F3+</span>&quot;. Certain vehicles have an HE Depletion number of &quot;8&quot; for 1944-45, as signified by the additional superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">4+</span>&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="z"></a><span class="f_Strong">Z. </span>This AFV has both a sD and a sM. The owning player may make a usage attempt (<a href="chd_chd13.htm#13.2" class="topiclink">D13.2</a>) for either (but not for both) during a Player Turn, after declaring which one he will attempt to fire. All other Smoke Dispenser rules also apply unchanged. If the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">4</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">4+</span>&quot;appears after the sD Usage number, this sD is not available prior to 1944.</p>
<p><a id="aa"></a><span class="f_Strong">AA.</span> MA and CMC (if so equipped) have AA capability—as signified by &quot;MA:AA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="bb"></a><span class="f_Strong">BB.</span> This vehicle may carry as a Passenger one (only) SMC and/or 1PP SW. This PP capacity may not be used for carrying ammunition (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a>).  <span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> The 1st edition of West of Alamein should have said &quot;and/or&quot;, which also applies to the Chinese VCL Mark IV Carrier(b) (<a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchinesevehiclenotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">Chinese Vehicle Note 13</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cc"></a><span class="f_Strong">CC.</span> The Churchill's combination of gear ratios and track length enabled it to climb steep gradients that would have defeated most other tanks. Therefore, a Churchill tank [EXC: while the Bridgelayer is carrying a bridge, the AVRE is carrying a fascine, or the Crocodile has its trailer hooked up] pays only 2 MP when ascending each intermediate level of an Abrupt Elevation Change (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">B10.51</a>) instead of the normal 4 MP, and can cross a Double-Crest (or Crest-line slope; <a href="chq_chq3.htm#3.53" class="topiclink">Q3.53</a>) hexside (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.52" class="topiclink">B10.52</a>) but must check for Bog (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.21" class="topiclink">D8.21</a>) with a +3 DRM. <span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> This Note was missing from the 1st Edition West of Alamein.</p>
