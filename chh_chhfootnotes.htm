<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.  <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.1" class="topiclink">1.1 UNIT PURCHASES:</a> </span>Players can create more &quot;Fog of War&quot; by keeping their purchases secret. This allows for more uncertainty in knowing exactly what the opponent possesses and preserves the surprise element made possible by the purchase of fortified buildings, tunnels, HIP, etc. On the negative side, it can be infuriating to play an entire scenario before finding out that one's opponent made a mathematical error and was playing with 20% more forces than they were allowed! The choice is best made within one's own circle of friends.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.  <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.13" class="topiclink">1.13 MECHANICS:</a></span> While the spirit and letter of this rule can be technically evaded by calculating all purchases on scrap paper before recording them on the Roster, it is hoped that not doing so will become part of the &quot;honor system.&quot; This not only speeds up preparation for play (by eliminating unit wheeling and dealing to use those last remaining points) but will also put the players more closely in the position of the field commander who never experienced the freedoms of choice in equipment/unit availability that the DYO player has.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3.  <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.28" class="topiclink">1.28 ELR:</a></span> The ELR suggestions are merely that; they are not hard and fast rules but general guidelines for those who do not wish to research their own scenarios. Much ado may be made of the lowering of ELR for U.S. units in early '44, and for British units in '45. The rationale for the general lowering of U.S. ELR is the great influx of new, untried units prior to the Normandy landings. By late '44 the American Army was suffering from a shortage of infantrymen and replacements were being fed into the line straight from basic training. One could well make a case on these grounds for continuing the lower ELR through the duration. Likewise the British had long since reached the limits of their manpower resources and the pluck of the professional British soldier with the end now in sight was tainted with a widespread desire not to be the last casualty in the war. Nevertheless, keep in mind that these are gross simplifications and hardly a substitute for research into the actual performance of the units being represented in any given action.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.  <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.8" class="topiclink">1.8 LEADERS:</a> </span>The establishment of a set formula for the number and quality of leaders allowed in a DYO scenario has an admittedly vast potential for abuse, in that it will be adhered to by many as a hard and fast rule which robs the scenario creator of originality in depicting unusual circumstances and performances by tinkering with his conception of the leadership influence on that event. Nonetheless, as a general guideline for those seeking such in DYO scenarios it can be a useful tool. Unless a scenario designer has a strong research rationale to vary from the formula he would do well to adhere to it for the relative availability and quality of leadership is one of the strongest nationality traits observed in the ASL game system.</p>
