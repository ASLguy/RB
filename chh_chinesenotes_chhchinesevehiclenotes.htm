<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the early 1930s China possessed not a single factory capable of producing a tank, truck or airplane. Consequently, all AFV and transport vehicles were imported, leaving Chinese forces not only with a myriad of different makes and models but also highly dependent on a steady flow of parts and ammunition from the various manufacturers thousands of miles away. The first tanks to arrive in China were Renault FT-17s, 36 of which were purchased by the commander of the Manchurian Army in 1924. They were used in fighting between several of the northern warlords; later the survivors became the first tanks in the Nationalist armory, being used in Manchuria against the Japanese in 1931. It appears that when the 1937-45 War of Resistance against Japan broke out in July 1937, the Nationalists fielded three armored battalions comprising some 96 &quot;tanks&quot; (probably inclusive of tankettes and armored MG carriers). However, by 1938, after the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing (Nanking), more than half of them had been lost. Subsequent purchases from the Soviet Union and Italy brought the total up to about 200 by early 1941. From that time the U.S. and, to a lesser degree Britain and the Commonwealth, took over as the main suppliers of war materiel to China.</p>
<p>Chinese ordnance nomenclature was similar to the Japanese in its use of a &quot;Type #&quot; dating system. However, the Chinese based theirs on the year 1911, the founding year of the Republic. Thus the Type 22 armored car dated from 1933 (22 + 11 =33), while the Type 31 mortar was accepted in 1942. Unfortunately, most of the Chinese designations for their various types of equipment are unavailable in Western sources.</p>
<p>One interesting historical note, not directly relative to Chinese vehicles but nonetheless worth mentioning, is the influence of German and Soviet advisors on the Nationalist military in the 1930s. During that decade, such famous figures as von Seekt and von Falkenhausen—and later, Zhukov and Chuikov—were top military advisors to Jiang Kai-shek. The German influence, being both of longer duration and politically more akin to the beliefs of the Generalissimo, were by far the greater.</p>

The British War Office designated them the A4E11 and A4E12 for testing purposes, but declined to accept them for service. They were then offered for sale abroad, and numbers were purchased by several countries including Siam and the Netherlands East Indies. The Soviet Union bought eight, and from them developed the T-37 (<a href="chh_russiannotes_chhrussianvehiclenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">Russian Vehicle Note 1</a>). China ordered twenty-nine, the last of which was delivered in May 1935. These were assigned to the 1st Tank Battalion in Shanghai where they participated in the battles for that city in 1937. The Chinese version carried a Vickers 7.92mm machine gun in its one-man turret, and had balsa-wood floats encased in sheet metal over its tracks to provide additional buoyancy. Water propulsion and steering were provided by a propeller and rudder on the rear hull. &quot;VCL&quot; stands for &quot;Vickers Carden-Loyd&quot;.</p>
<p>† The Target Size TH DRM is +3 (and also HD) if in a Water Obstacle or deep/flooded stream.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.2 for 1937, 1.4 for 1938, and 1.6 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><img src="chinv004.jpg" width="175" height="78" alt="ChinV004" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. &nbsp;L3/35(i): </span>In the latter half of the 1930s Italy sold about 100 late-production L3/35 (<a href="chh_italiannotes_chhitalianvehiclenotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">Italian Vehicle Note 2</a>) to China. They were still being used in 1945. Chinese L3/35 differed from the standard Italian versions by carrying different machine guns designed to fire Chinese-made ammunition. Twenty L3/35 were assigned to the 3rd Tank Battalion in Nanjing (Nanking).</p>
<p>† If Stunned, this AFV may not regain CE status, may not fire any weapon, and is Recalled as per <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">D5.341</a>; these are signified by &quot;Stun = Recall &amp; CE/FP NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† The BMG may be Scrounged as one or two LMG (as per <a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">D10.5</a>), but is considered one MG for malfunction, repair and disablement purposes.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.2 for 1937-38, 1.3 for 1939-40, 1.4 for 1941-42, and 1.5 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="chinv005.jpg" width="177" height="77" alt="ChinV005" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. &nbsp;PzKpfw IA(g):</span> This was the original version of the PzKpfw I (<a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 1</a>). A small number—perhaps as few as ten—were sold to China in the mid 1930s. Upon arrival they were assigned to the 3rd Tank Battalion in Nanjing (Nanking), where they very likely saw action in late 1937. The PzKpfw IA was felt to be underpowered for its size, due to the modest horsepower of its Krupp air-cooled gasoline engine (which also had a tendency to overheat). † RF is 1.3 for 1937, 1.5 for 1938, and 1.6 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="chinv006.jpg" width="178" height="77" alt="ChinV006" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. &nbsp;Vickers 6-Ton Mk E(b):</span> The Vickers 6-tonner was one of the more influential tank designs of the 1930s. Although not adopted by the British, it was sold (in a number of different versions) to over a dozen countries and provided the basis for the Russian T-26 (see <a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchinesevehiclenotes.htm#5" class="topiclink">Note 5</a> below) and Polish 7TP tanks. A total of twenty 6-tonners were purchased by China; sixteen of the Mk E type and four Mk F. Assigned to the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalions stationed at Shanghai, many were lost to the Japanese during the fighting around that city in 1937. † RF is 1.2 for 1937, 1.4 for 1938, and 1.6 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="chinv007.jpg" width="177" height="77" alt="ChinV007" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. &nbsp;T-26TU M33(r):</span> In 1938-39, with tensions high between the U.S.S.R. and Japan, the Soviets supplied China with eighty-eight T-26 M33 tanks (<a href="chh_russiannotes_chhrussianvehiclenotes.htm#6" class="topiclink">Russian Vehicle Note 6</a>). Photographic evidence indicates that they were radio-equipped; hence the TU designation in the name. They were assigned to the 1st Tank Regiment, of which at least a part was attached to the newly forming 200th Division, the only entirely motorized division in the Chinese Army. In early 1942 the 200th, along with a small number of (one source says only nine) T-26, was sent to Burma. It fought well there, but most if not all of its tanks were lost. Thereafter, Chinese T-26 saw action only in China.</p>
<p>† Each time a Mechanical Reliability DR (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">D2.51</a>) is made for this AFV, an &quot;11&quot; result indicates that it has Stalled. Its owner must then immediately make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to Stop, but excluding the MP expended to Start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It may again attempt to move (if otherwise allowed), but must expend another MP to Start— and must undergo another Stall DR as it does so. An AFV that stalls is subject to Defensive First Fire during the MPh (since it has expended a MP to Start), but not as a moving target unless it started the phase in Motion or had already entered a new hex during that phase. Should a Stall DR result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, it is considered to have expended its entire MP allotment in Delay.</p>
<p>† Optional AAMG RF is 1.2.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in Burma are 3/42 (1.3), 4/42 (1.4) and 5/42 (1.5). RF for use in China is 1.4 for 1939-42 and 1.5 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="chinv008.jpg" width="179" height="78" alt="ChinV008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. &nbsp;M3A3(a):</span> In October 1943 the 1st Provisional Tank Group (Chinese-American) was formed in Ramgarh, India, using Chinese personnel and Stuart V light tanks (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#4" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 4</a>) transferred from British Lend-Lease stocks. It was envisioned that the Group would eventually comprise six tank battalions, but not enough tanks could be supplied to achieve that goal, so only two were actually outfitted. Attached to X-Force, the 1st Tank Battalion, Provisional, saw action in northern Burma, while the 2nd was apparently used only for supply-line patrol duty. Later in the 1940s these two battalions formed the core of Nationalist armor in the Chinese civil war.</p>
<p>† Optional AAMG RF is 1.1.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.2 for 2-4/44 and 1.3 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="chinv009.jpg" width="175" height="78" alt="ChinV009" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. M4A4(a): </span>These were Sherman V medium tanks (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 14</a>) supplied by the British. The 1st Provisional Tank Group (Chinese-American) attached to X-Force in Burma contained one platoon of M4A4 to provide supporting fire, and this platoon was evidently assigned to the 1st Provisional Tank Battalion (see <a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchinesevehiclenotes.htm#6" class="topiclink">Note 6</a> above).</p>
<p>† This AFV is allowed the possibility of Multiple Hits (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.8" class="topiclink">C3.8</a>) even though its MA is &gt; 40mm. Moreover, in a Gun Duel (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.2401" class="topiclink">C2.2401</a>) its total Firer-based TH DRM are halved (FRD) prior to adding any Acquisition DRM. (The final total of all DRM may not be &lt; zero, and applies for Gun Duel calculations only.) These abilities are signified on the counter by the ROF # being printed on a white background.</p>
<p>† WP becomes available in June 1944—as signified by the superscript &quot;J4+&quot;</p>
<p>† Optional AAMG RF is 1.3.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.4 for 2-4/44 and 1.5 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="chinv010.jpg" width="177" height="78" alt="ChinV010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. M3A1(a):</span> As part of their initial Lend-Lease request in early 1941, the Nationalist government asked the U.S. for 400 scout cars. In October of that year the first 35 M3A1s (along with 48 75mm pack howitzers, 100 .50-cal. HMGs, 500 Bren LMGs and 11,000 Tommy guns) were shipped from New York aboard the SS Tulsa. However, in late December of that year, much of its cargo was turned over to the British at Rangoon, which leaves it unclear as to how much (if any) of its cargo ever reached the Chinese. A total of 129 M3A1s were eventually Lend-Leased to the Nationalists, with most (if not all) probably being used by X-Force in Burma.</p>
<p>† This AFV starts the scenario with an Inherent crew, and also with a 2-2-7 crew as a Passenger that applies to the vehicle's PP capacity (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>) and is additional to all 2-2-7 crews listed in the scenario OB. This AFV may retain any unpossessed SW aboard it (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">D6.4</a>), either of its crews may Remove either of its MG, and Mounted Fire penalties (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>) do not apply to its Passenger(s). ERRATA: For both the Chinese and U.S. versions of the M3A1 Scout Car, the MA is Removed as a dm .50-cal. HMG and the other MG is removed as a dm MMG.</p>
<p>† The AAMG FP actually consists of two MG: one .50-cal HMG (MA; 4 FP) and one secondary .30-cal MMG (2 FP)—as signified by &quot;4MA&amp;[red]2&quot; on the counter. The Inherent crew may fire only the .50-cal MA unless it is malfunctioned or disabled, in which case the Inherent crew may fire the secondary AAMG instead. Otherwise, only a Good Order Passenger may use the secondary AAMG (as signified on the counter by printing its FP in red). Assuming they are properly manned, the MA AAMG and secondary AAMG may be fired together as a FG or at separate targets (as per <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">D3.5</a>). The secondary AAMG, when being fired by a Passenger, counts as use of a SW by that Passenger.</p>
<p>Each AAMG malfunctions and is repaired or disabled independently of the other. If the MA AAMG malfunctions, mark the vehicle with a &quot;MA Malfunction&quot; counter to show that its secondary AAMG is still usable. If the secondary AAMG malfunctions, mark it with an &quot;AAMG Malfunction&quot; counter. Since the ROF applies only to the MA (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">A9.2</a>), the owner must announce before he fires that he is using the MA if he wishes to possibly retain a multiple ROF. An Armor/Passenger leader may direct the fire of more than one vehicular-mounted/Passenger-fired MG only if those MG are firing together as a FG.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.3 for 11/43-2/44 and 1.4 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="chinv011.jpg" width="178" height="78" alt="ChinV011" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. Stuart Recon(a):</span> A small number of M3A3 tanks in the 1st Provisional Tank Group (Chinese-American) had their turret removed in order to add a slightly built-up superstructure with pintle-mounted machine guns. These altered Stuarts were used as command/reconnaissance vehicles.</p>
<p>† The MA may be fired only at a target that lies within this AFV's VCA—as signified by &quot;MA: VCA only&quot; on the counter. See also <a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhmultichinvehnotes.htm#d" class="topiclink">Chinese Vehicle Note D</a>.</p>
<p>† The cost for Passenger(s) to (un)load is doubled to ½ of the AFV's MP allotment and two MF for the Personnel—as signified by &quot;(un)load x 2&quot; on the counter. All attacks made by the Passenger(s) of this AFV are halved (or receive a +2 TH DRM) as Mounted Fire (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>). This AFV may retain any unpossessed SW aboard it (D6.4), but its MG may not be Removed.</p>
<p>† The AAMG may be Scrounged as one or two LMG (as per <a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">D10.5</a>), but is considered one MG for malfunction, repair and disablement purposes.</p>
<p>† The &quot;Scout Car&quot; designation is given only in deference to the vehicle's historical use. For all game purposes it is treated as fully tracked.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.5 for 11/43-2/44 and 1.6 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="chinv012.jpg" width="179" height="78" alt="ChinV012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. &nbsp; Type 22:</span> &nbsp;Both warlords and Nationalist forces converted foreign trucks into armored cars at various times. Unfortunately, very little is known about these vehicles—not even their names in most cases—and few photographs of them exist. This game piece is therefore a generic representation of such indigenously produced AFV, based on one historical type.</p>
<p>† The CMG MA actually comprises two 2-FP CMG. Each has a 360° traverse independent of the other, and thus can have its own TCA. Each has a Normal Range of eight hexes and may be Removed or Scrounged— as signified by &quot;Nml Rng 8&quot; and &quot;Rmvl/Scrng OK&quot; on the counter. The two CMG may fire at separate targets in different Locations or at the same Location; <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">D3.5</a> applies unchanged. Each MG malfunctions, and is repaired or disabled, independently of the other. Disabled-MA Recall (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">D3.7</a>) occurs only when both MG are disabled.</p>
<p>Whichever of the two MG fires first in a phase is considered the MA for both that attack and the remainder of that phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase). If both fire as a FG, only one can be considered MA (and thus might retain Multiple ROF); if one of them in that FG malfunctions, determine randomly whether or not it was the one considered MA for that phase.</p>
<p>† Reverse movement costs this vehicle three times its normal hex entry cost—as signified by &quot;REVX3&quot; on the counter,</p>
<p>† RF is 1.5 for 1937-42 and 1.6 thereafter.</p>
<p><img src="chinv014.jpg" width="343" height="79" alt="ChinV014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. &nbsp;PSW221(g)&amp;PSW 222(g):</span> A small number—perhaps a few dozen in all—of these armored cars (<a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#69" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Notes 69</a> and <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#70" class="topiclink">70</a>), along with a few PSW 223 long-range-radio variants, were purchased from Germany in the mid 1930s. The PSW 221 was apparently the most common German armored car in Nationalist service. Some of these vehicles are reputed to have been used in the 3rd Tank Battalion stationed at Nanjing (Nanking), and most likely saw action there in late 1937.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a>Several WW1 Lancia 1ZM armored cars (<a href="chh_italiannotes_chhitalianvehiclenotes.htm#19" class="topiclink">Italian Vehicle Note 19</a>) were shipped from Italy to China in 1937, evidently intended for the Italian garrison in Tianjin (Tientsin). It is not known if any were turned over to the Chinese.</p>
<p>† All 1MT restrictions apply in the normal manner to the PSW 221(g) [EXC: the crew must be CE to fire the CMG]; this is signified by &quot;BU FP NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† The MA of the PSW221(g), and both the MA and CMG of the PSW 222(g), have AA capability—as signified by &quot;MA: AA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Reverse movement costs the PSW 221(g) four times, and the PSW 222(g) three times, its normal hex entry cost; these are signified by &quot;REVX4&quot; and &quot;REVx3&quot; on the respective counters.</p>
<p>† PSW221(g) RF is 1.3 for 1937, 1.4 for 1938, and 1.5 thereafter. PSW 222(g) RF is 1.4 for 1937, 1.5 for 1938, and 1.6 thereafter.</p>

(In game terms, the BA-10 is equivalent to the BA-6 and the FAI is equivalent to the BA-20.) What use the Chinese made of these vehicles is unknown; however, given the scarcity of roads in the country and the poor off-road capability of these AFV, they probably saw little action outside of urban areas.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><img src="chinv017.jpg" width="173" height="77" alt="ChinV017" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13. VCL Mk VI Carrier(b):</span> This tiny AFV, which utilized a Ford Model T engine and drive train, first appeared in 1927. It was designed to provide increased mobility for the Vickers MG, and could also be used to tow a light gun. Besides being adopted by the British Army, several hundred were sold abroad, leading to such foreign designs as the Italian L3/35 (<a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchinesevehiclenotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">Note 2</a> above) and Polish TK tankettes. Twenty-four Mk VI Carriers were ordered by China, with the first shipment arriving there in May 1929. Those still operational in the late '30s were assigned to the 2nd Tank Battalion in Shanghai.</p>
<p>† The VCL Mk VI is considered a Carrier (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.8" class="topiclink">D6.8</a>) [EXC: it has a Passenger capacity of one PP for ammunition (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a>) or one SMC and/or one 1PP-SW, but may not carry a Rider(s); it contains an Inherent crew even if unarmed, and that original crew always takes counter form as a 2-2-7 infantry-crew].</p>

<p>† If Stunned, this AFV may not fire and is Recalled as per <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">D5.341</a>; this is signified by &quot;Stun = Recall &amp; FP NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Optional BMG RF is 1.2.</p>

Carriers A(b), B(b) &amp; C(b):</span> The British, Canadians and Australians apparently all supplied Carriers to China. Various sources state that 1500 were provided by Australia and 1200 by Canada, but it seems unlikely that the Chinese successfully took delivery of that many prior to the end of hostilities. Nor is it clear just how these Carriers were employed; however, at least one Chinese &quot;armored carrier&quot; company was present in Burma in 1942, and Carriers were also used there in 1944-45 by the 1st Provisional Tank Group (Chinese-American). The use of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; in the piece names are our own designations to help differentiate between similar models.</p>
<p>† See <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.8" class="topiclink">D6.8-.84</a> for the basic rules pertaining to Carriers. Towing capability is not usable prior to 1945—as signified by the superscript &quot;5&quot;. If a Carrier A, B or C is to start a DYO scenario as a towing vehicle, a 2-2-7 infantry-crew may be purchased for it in lieu of its Inherent HS; this is done by adding two points in the &quot;Opt BPV&quot; column of the DYO Roster's &quot;Vehicle&quot; section. The MF expenditures given in <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">C10.11</a> and <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.12" class="topiclink">C10.12</a> for (un)hooking a Gun apply unchanged if the MMC performing that action is simultaneously (un)loading from/into a Carrier A, B or C.</p>

This can be done only by placing an AA counter on the Carrier at the end of any friendly fire phase (not MPh) in which the BMG has not fired and the Inherent MMC is not stunned, shocked, broken or in Melee. As long as the AA counter remains on the Carrier, its FP is assumed to be &quot;-/-/2&quot; with a zero Multiple ROF. The AAMG may be repositioned as the BMG MA by using these same principles to remove the AA counter.</p>
<p>† The Carrier B's BATR has a &quot;1&quot; Multiple ROF, has a maximum TH range of 12 hexes (as signified by &quot;[12] TH&quot; on the counter), and may be Scrounged/Removed.</p>
<p>† The Carrier C's MA may not be Removed, as signified by &quot;Rmvl NA&quot; on the counter, and may be Scrounged only as a LMG.</p>
<p>† Carrier A(b) and Carrier B(b) Dates and RF for use in China are 1942-45 (1.6); for use in Burma they are 3-5/42 (1.5), 11/43-4/44 (1.3) and 5/44-3/45 (1.4). Carrier C(b) Dates and RF for use in China are 1943-45 (1.6); for use in Burma they are 11/43-4/44 (1.4) and 5/44-3/45 (1.5).</p>

Henschel 33 (g) Truck:</span> As with so many other types of materiel, the Chinese acquired transport vehicles from many different nations (including the U.S.) during the 1930s. By 1939 there were some 7,000 German trucks alone in China, of which probably a good number were Henschel 33, a widely exported model. Due to bad roads, few spare parts and the lack of proper maintenance, vehicles in China were invariably in poor mechanical condition (as evidenced in the game by the large percentage of Chinese vehicles with red MP allotments), and only a fraction of the total number were in operating condition at any one time. Moreover, no organized transport system for the army even existed. Of the more than 300 Chinese divisions, only one—the 200th— was completely motorized.</p>
<p>† RF for use in China is 1.3 for 1937-38, 1.4 for 1939-41, 1.5 for 1942-43, and 1.6 thereafter. Dates and RF for use in Burma are 3-5/42 (1.4) and 5/44-1/45 (1.5).</p>

Jeep(a) &amp; 2½-Ton(a) Truck:</span> The very first Lend-Lease shipment to China, consisting of 300 2½-ton trucks, left New York in May 1941 bound for Rangoon. By the end of that year vehicles were trickling across the Chinese border via the Burma Road, but bottlenecks along the route were creating a substantial backlog around Burma's capital. As a result, when the invading Japanese neared the city in March of 1942, 972 Lend-Lease trucks in various stages of assembly had to be destroyed, and 683 more plus 260 Jeeps were hurriedly transferred to British control. Once the Burma Road was cut, all transport vehicles bound for China proper had to be flown over the Hump and re-assembled in Kunming. U.S. trucks and Jeeps were supplied to X-Force, and Y-Force was provided with 475 Jeeps. By the end of 1944 there were approximately 10,000 trucks in Nationalist-controlled China, but according to one estimate only about 2,000 of them were in operating condition. To make matters worse, they were dispersed among various Chinese agencies and private owners. Despite pleas from U.S. advisors, it was not until 1945 that even a half-hearted attempt was made to exercise some degree of control over motor transport for the army. During the course of Lend-Lease, a total of 24,991 trucks were released to China, comprising 11,982 of ≤ one ton (including Jeeps), 2,616 of 1½ to 2 ton, 10,230 2½-ton and 163 of &gt; 2½ tons. It should be noted, however, that many of these probably arrived after the end of hostilities in 1945.</p>
<p>† If armed, the Jeep has an Inherent crew and thus a CS# instead of a cs#. The Jeep's optional AAMG is a .50-cal HMG (RF 1.3) if 4 FP or a MMG (RF 1.1) if 2 FP—and may be Removed (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>) as that type of MG (i.e., as a .50-cal. or MMG respectively).</p>
<p>† Jeep(a) Dates and RF for use in China are 1942-43 (1.6) and 1944-45 (1.5); for use in Burma they are 3-5/42 (1.5) and 11/43-3/45 (1.3). 2½-Ton(a) Dates and RF for use in China are 1942-43 (1.6) and 1944-45 (1.5); for use in Burma they are 3-5/42 (1.5) and 11/43-3/45 (1.4).</p>
