Lance-Grenades de 50 mle 37(f):</span> Ordered at the end of 1939, one LG was supposed to replace the four rifle grenade-launchers (one per squad) in the infantry section (i.e., platoon). It used a fixed 45° elevation, with range adjusted by altering the diameter of propellant-gas vents, and was trigger-fired. 20,000 had been manufactured by June 1940, but very little ammunition was available. It seems that the only ones in service at the time of the German invasion were a dozen installed in special rotating, retractable armored cupolas in the Maginot Line. Some LG were used by French infantry near the end of the war; e.g., the 18th RCC (Regiment de Chasseurs a Cheval) had twelve during its campaign in southwest France in 1945. (This was one of several units raised in late 1944 using ex-Resistance fighters and a mixture of U.S., British, French and German equipment.) The LG also saw action after WW2 vs the Viet Minh in Indo-China.</p>

Mortier de 60 mle 35:</span> Designed by the Edgar Brandt firm and derived from the 81mm mle 27/31, the mle 35 was the standard light mortar of the French Army. One was normally issued per (motorized) infantry compagnie, and per cavalry/motorcycle reconnaissance escadron (squadron) in GRDI and GRCA. In the DLC, the 5th (heavy weapons) squadron of each cavalry regiment was authorized a peloton (platoon) of four, while each motorcycle escadron in the RAM (as well as each combined motorcycle-AMR (see <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 2</a>), and each motorized infantry, escadron in the RDP) had one 60mm mortar. In May 1940, some 4,940 (possibly excluding those in France's overseas possessions) were in service. In November 1942, 360 were present in Vichy North Africa. Copies of the mle 35 were produced in the U.S.A. (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note 1</a>), China (<a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchineseordnancenotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">Chinese Ordnance Note 3</a>) and Romania. The mle 35 fired both light (2.9-lb.) and heavy (4.9-lb.) HE bombs. See also <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#22" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 22</a>.</p>
<p>† IR ammunition becomes available in 1942, but only for the Free French—as signified by &quot;IR2+&quot; on the British-color version.</p>
<p>† Unlike the U.S. 60mm mortar [including its British-color &quot;(a)&quot; version; <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a>], French 60mm mortars [including their British-color &quot;(f)&quot; version; <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.8c" class="topiclink">F.8C</a>] cannot be exchanged for OBA.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for Free French DYO purchase purposes are 6-7/41 (1.3) and 5-11/43 (1.4); for other Dates, use the Free French SW Allotment Chart.</p>

Mortier de 81 mle 27/31:</span> Designed by the Edgar Brandt firm in 1927 and further improved four years later, this mortar became the classic design of the era, being copied during the 1930s and '40s by at least a dozen countries. It fired both light (7-lb.) and heavy (14.3-lb.) HE rounds, as well as smoke. In 1940 about 5,000 were in service in France, with two (i.e., one groupe) normally allotted per (motorized) infantry battalion (in the heavy weapons platoon [section d'engins] of its CA) and another groupe in the regiment's CRE (two groupes [one section] in the CRME if the regiment was motorized); these mortars were usually carried in wagons, even in motorized infantry regiments. In DLC and DLM, each RDP had two groupes (one peloton) in the EME of each of its battalions. The BCP of each DCR had a section of four in its CE. MG battalions were authorized three groupes each. A number of mle 27/31 were also used in casemates and armored cupolas in the Maginot Line, and by the Free French in North Africa (e.g., the 1st BFL had 20 at Bir Hakeim in May 1942—four per infantry battalion and four in the reserve company). In November 1942, 600 were present in Vichy North Africa.</p>
<p>† (Vichy) French Dates and RF are 39-5/43 (1.2) and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.2). For Free French they are 9/40-5/41 (1.3), 6-7/41 (1.4), 8/41-4/43 (1.1), and 5-11/43 (1.5).</p>

Fusil Antichar Boys:</span> This was the standard British ATR, a number of which were issued to certain GRDI and GRCA due to the shortage of 25mm anti-tank guns. When present, they were allocated to the EME of these units. The Boys' violent recoil and mediocre armor penetration made it unpopular among its French users. Free French units fighting with the British were issued Boys ATR, and the British also supplied 446 to the Vichy troops fighting the Axis in Tunisia.</p>
<p>French troops in Indo-China possessed a goodly number of pre-WW2 Russian ATR. Some had originally been brought into France by Republican troops during/after the Spanish Civil War, and the rest had been purchased from China. These Russian ATR were models (most likely of several different designs) that had been rejected for use by the Red Army.</p>
<p>† For use in Indo-China, treat this ATR as having &quot;B11&quot;.</p>
<p>† Availability, Dates and RF are: Europe [EXC: Norway], 39-6/40 (1.5); Indo-China, 9/40, 1/41 and 3/45 (all 1.0); and Tunisia, 1-2/43 (1.4), 3/43 (1.3) and 4-5/43 (1.2).</p>

Canon Antichar de 25 SA-L mle 34:</span> Built by Hotchkiss, the SA-L 34 was accepted in 1934 as the standard battalion and regimental anti-tank gun of the French Army. By the end of June 1940, some 4,500 were in service. Production lagged behind demand, however, so the SA-L 37 (somewhat lighter, but equivalent in game terms) was introduced to supplement it; about 1,600 of this version were delivered prior to the armistice. In service it was found that the light weight of the SA-L made it rather flimsy for high-speed towing, so it was often horse-drawn or (primarily in motorized/cavalry units) carried en portee. The heavy-weapons section of a CA was authorized a groupe of two, with another six (in two three-gun sections) in the CRE/CRME, and a further section in the EME of the GRDI. Each cavalry regiment in the DLC, and each battalion of the RDP in the DLC and DLM, had two groupes of SA-L in its EME. Each (motorized) infantry division was authorized a CDAC, and each DLC and DLM was authorized an EDAC, of twelve SA-L. The BCP of each DCR contained four SA-L sections in its CE. GRCA were authorized two groupes (plus, if non-motorized, a third in their groupe d'es-cadrons a cheval horse-cavalry element). MG battalions were authorized three sections each. 75+ modified 25mm anti-tank guns were emplaced in various types of Maginot Line fortifications. The number of SA-L available in May 1940 was several thousand short of the Army's full requirement, leaving many infantry-type divisions with only part of their anti-tank gun allotment and a few with none at all. In November 1942, 101 SA-L were present in Vichy North Africa; there (or at least in Tunisia), the CA had no anti-tank groupe—instead, most SA-L were used in (apparently independent) six-gun compagnies/batteries, though some infantry-type regiments contained one section. See also <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#23" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 23</a>.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 39-6/40 (1.2) [EXC: 1.3 for Norway], 7/40-5/43 (1.3) [EXC: NA in Madagascar], and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.3).</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="freno014.jpg" width="250" height="74" alt="FrenO014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. Canon Antichar de 47 SA mle 37 APX:</span> First ordered in 1936 from the Puteaux arsenal (APX), this weapon fired a tungsten-core AP round, making it the world's most powerful purpose-built anti-tank gun when it entered service. (Its very existence was so secret that delivery to units was withheld until September 1939.) 841, including 135 in the general reserve, were in France when the Germans invaded; however, a lack of sufficient ammunition kept many from ever being issued. Each non-alpine division in France was authorized a BDAC comprising twelve (ideally, but in practice only eight) SA 37 APX. In reality though, most BDAC contained only six (or sometimes four) such guns—while others were equipped with converted 75mm pieces instead (see French Ordnance Note 7), and some divisions had no BDAC at all. Oddly, the BDAC was usually assigned to the divisional artillery, thus in effect placing it at the rear of the division—which in conjunction with its general scarcity gave rise to the nickname &quot;ghost gun&quot; for the weapon because it was so rarely seen by front-line troops. The SA 37 APX in non-motorized infantry divisions were horse-drawn. A version of the gun with a tripod mounting to allow full 360° traverse (very similar in concept to the British 2pdr) was developed as the SA 39, but in 1940 existed only in prototype form.</p>
<p>Despite their potent anti-tank capability, most of the SA 37 APX captured by the Germans remained in France (where some saw action vs the Allies in 1944); this was probably due to Germany's chronic shortage of tungsten. A small number of SA 37 APX captured in the Levant were used by the Free French in North Africa, seven being with the 1st BFL at Bir Hakeim in May 1942—one in the 2nd Foreign Legion Battalion and the rest in the 1st Anti-Tank Company. In November 1942, some 45 were present in Vichy North Africa (apparently all in Tunisia) where they were used in batteries of 6-12 guns, again usually as part of artillery regiments.</p>
<p>† This Gun fires only APCR.</p>
<p>† (Vichy) French Dates and RF are 5/40-5/43 and 1.4 [EXC: NA in Norway, Indo-China and Madagascar], For Free French they are 2-6/42 (1.3) and 7/42-5/43 (1.5).</p>

Canon de 75 Antichar mle 97/35:</span> This little-known gun was actually the mle 1897 (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#11" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 11</a>) modified to use a circular firing platform beneath its wheels (like the British 25pdr), thus allowing a more rapid traverse of the gun. Several hundred of these platforms were manufactured beginning in 1935, but it is unclear how many of the converted guns were used in action. It seems that, despite their potent tank-killing capability, they were unpopular due to their weight and longer (un)limbering time. Those issued were assigned to various BDAC.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="freno018.jpg" width="131" height="56" alt="FrenO018" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. Canon de 37 mle 16 TR:</span> This small gun, a Puteaux design of 1916, was intended to provide close support for infantry, especially vs enemy machine guns. It remained in service after WW1, but in France by 1940 was used mainly as a substitute anti-tank weapon to help offset the shortage of 25mm anti-tank guns. Two small wooden wheels were provided for ease of movement, but were usually removed before firing. Alternatively, the gun could be broken down into three loads for pack transport. In France the mle 16 TR was found mainly in second-line and reserve units, but each GRDI was authorized one in its EME. 1,036 (probably excluding those outside of France) were available in May 1940. In November 1942, 303 were present in Vichy North Africa; there (or at least in Tunisia), each infantry-type regiment was authorized one section of (most likely three or four) mle 16 TR. &quot;TR&quot; stands for Tir Rapide (rapid fire).</p>
<p>During WW1 the U.S. had adopted the mle 16 TR as the M1916, and retained some in storage in 1941 (at that time it was still listed as the official anti-tank gun of the U.S. Marines). A number of mle 16 TR were used by Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War, and a modified version of the gun was produced in Japan (<a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhjapaneseordnancenotes.htm#9" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note 9</a>).</p>
<p>† This weapon may enter and be fired from all terrain types allowed to a HMG (e.g., an upper building level). As a SW it incurs no CA-change DRM penalty (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">C9.2</a>), but is subject to the woods/building CA restrictions of <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">A9.21</a>. It has no Gunshield, and its portage cost while dm is 3 PP. See also <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhmultifrenchordnotes.htm#c" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note C</a>.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.3 prior to 7/40 [EXC: NA in Norway], and 1.2 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="freno020.jpg" width="164" height="76" alt="FrenO020" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. &nbsp;Canon de 65 M mle 06:</span> In May 1940 only seventy examples of this pre-WWl mountain gun were still in active service in France, equipping several fortress- and mountain-artillery units—the remainder having been replaced by the 75mm mle 28 (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#10" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 10</a>) or relegated to the general reserve. However, the mle 06 was also used overseas in French North Africa (where 109 were present in November 1942), the Levant, and Indo-China (22 present in December 1944). In action it was usually positioned in or near the front line for direct-fire support. The gun itself was unusual in employing the counter- or soft-recoil system, wherein the barrel travels forward when the lanyard is pulled, and the gun fires as the barrel's forward travel limit is reached, thus utilizing its momentum to help offset the recoil force.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.6) [EXC: NA in Norway], 7/40-5/43 (1.4), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.4).</p>

Canon de 75 M mle 28:</span> Produced by Schneider, this was an improved version of the firm's earlier Canon de 75 Montagne mle 19, which had been designed to replace the 65mm mle 06. (Both 75mm guns are equivalent in game terms.) In 1940 the 75 M equipped mountain and colonial artillery groupes, with 156 mobilized in France on May 1st of that year. They were also used in French overseas territories. The mle 19 was exported to Greece, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia, while the mle 28 was sold to Poland. French mountain gun batteries comprised four guns.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.5) [EXC: NA in Norway], 7/40-5/41 (1.3), 6/41-5/43 (1.5), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.3).</p>

Canon de 75 mle 1897:</span> The &quot;French 75&quot; (or soixante-quinze—&quot;75&quot;) was a Puteaux design built by Schneider and the Bourges arsenal. It was revolutionary in being the first field gun with a successful hydraulic recoil system and fast-acting breech block. The details of its design were a closely guarded secret prior to WW1, but afterwards it went into service in so many countries that it became the most widely used field gun ever produced. Even though it was rather outdated by the start of WW2 (despite many having been retrofitted with pneumatic tires for high-speed towing), the sheer numbers of mle 1897 in the French artillery park made the cost of replacing them prohibitively high. In France alone, some 4,500 (including those converted to the anti-tank role; see French Ordnance Note 7) were in active service at the start of May 1940, with another 68 in the general reserve. The mle 1897 was the standard light artillery piece in most French divisions, and was also used in a number of armored cupolas in the Maginot Line. A batterie comprised four guns, with three batteries forming a groupe. In November 1942, 334 mle 1897 were present in Vichy North Africa. Other users of the gun during WW2 were the United States (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note 13</a>), Poland, Greece, Romania, and Germany (captured pieces; see also German <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanordnancenotes.htm#9" class="topiclink">Ordnance Note 9</a>).</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 39-5/43 (1.3) [EXC: 1.4 in Norway], and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.3).</p>

(Both versions of the 105 M are equivalent in game terms.) It was used mostly in the French overseas territories; only 24 (two groupes) were in France in May 1940, all apparently in the Alps defenses. Due to its relatively short range, the 105 M was often positioned for use in a direct-fire role. Some were exported to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 6/40 (1.6), 7/40-7/41 (1.5), 8/41-5/43 (1.6), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.5).</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><img src="freno028.jpg" width="165" height="76" alt="FrenO028" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13. &nbsp;Canon de 105 C mle 35 B:</span> In the early 1930s it was decide to replace the existing stocks of WWl-vintage 155mm howitzers with lighter 105mm pieces. The first of the new guns to appear was the 105 C mle 34 S (&quot;C&quot;: Court—i.e., short-barreled) built by Schneider. Shortly thereafter the 105 C mle 35 B, produced by the Bourges arsenal, was accepted as well. Both were very similar in characteristics and performance, and were referred to collectively as 105 C. A total of 376 (of which 210 were mle 35 B) had been mobilized in France by the start of May 1940. Two groupes (of three four-gun batteries apiece) were authorized in each DCR and DLM; in addition, 105 C were issued to certain DLC and DIM, in which case one such groupe replaced one of the division's standard C 17 S (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#16" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 16</a>) groupes. One interesting feature of the mle 35 B was that its large, solid pressed-steel wheels were attached to the gun trails in such a manner that when the trails were opened, the wheels &quot;toed in&quot; at the front to provide extra cover for part of the crew. On the other hand, many 105 C were built only for horse traction despite their otherwise-modern design. Few if any were used outside of France.</p>

Among the elderly guns still doing first-line duty was the L 13 S (&quot;L&quot;: Long—i.e., long-barreled), produced by Schneider based on a Russian 107mm design. It entered service in 1914, and after WW1 was widely exported. Only the later models had pneumatic tires for vehicular towing. In May 1940 some 857 were available in France, used as corps (and in a few cases as divisional) artillery. Sixteen 105 L were present in Vichy North Africa in November 1942. During WW2 the L 13 S (or derivatives thereof) also saw action in the armies of Italy (<a href="chh_italiannotes_chhitalianordnancenotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">Italian Ordnance Note 13</a>), Belgium, Yugoslavia, Poland, China (<a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchineseordnancenotes.htm#12" class="topiclink">Chinese Ordnance Note 12</a>) and Germany (captured pieces).</p>

Surprisingly though, some were still built to be horse-drawn. At the time of the German invasion, 145 had been mobilized in France with another four in the general reserve. They were employed primarily as corps heavy artillery, and in a few cases replaced C 17 S as divisional heavy guns. The mle 36 was sold to Romania, and some sources allege that it (or one of its prototypes) also served as the basis of the Type 92 field gun (<a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhjapaneseordnancenotes.htm#15" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note 15</a>). In French service, all 105mm field artillery batteries normally comprised four guns.</p>

Canon de 155 C mle 17 S:</span> Originally designed by Schneider as a 152mm piece for Tsarist Russia, the C 17 S heavy field howitzer was adopted by the French during WW1, and afterwards was widely exported and license-built. In 1940 the French possessed over 2,000, of which 1,852 were in France (including 25 in the general reserve). The majority were horse-drawn. Most French infantry-type divisions were authorized a regiment of C 17 S comprising two twelve-gun groupes. 36 C 17 S were present in Vichy North Africa in November 1942. In French service, all 155mm artillery batteries normally comprised four guns. Other users of the C 17 S (or derivatives thereof) during WW2 included Belgium, China (<a href="chh_chinesenotes_chhchineseordnancenotes.htm#14" class="topiclink">Chinese Ordnance Note 14</a>), Finland, Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and the U.S.A. (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#17" class="topiclink">U.S.Ordnance Note 17</a>). The Germans issued many captured C 17 S to their own artillery units. (Most other types of ex-French artillery they relegated to coast defense.)</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.4) [EXC: NA in Norway], 7/40-5/41 (1.6), 6-7/41 (1.5), 11/42-5/43 (1.5), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.6).</p>

Canon de 155 GPF: </span>The GPF, as this gun was often referred to, first saw action in 1917 and proved to be one of the best heavy artillery pieces of WW1. Later, two variants (both equivalent to the GPF in game terms) were produced in small numbers: the GPF-CA and the GPF-T, the latter being the most modern gun in French service in 1940. At the time of the German invasion, 402 of all types had been mobilized in France, equipping a number of twelve-gun groupes d'artillerie lourde a tracteur employed at corps level. The GPF was also used by the U.S., who in addition produced a license-built version (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#19" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note 19</a>). Many of the French guns were captured by the Germans, who for a time used them as first-line heavy artillery (e.g., in the Afrika Korps). &nbsp;Nine GPF were present in Vichy North Africa in November 1942. &quot;GPF&quot; stands for Grande Puissance (&quot;High Power&quot;) Fillioux (the designer's name).</p>
<p>The game piece also represents the Canon de 155 L mle 17 S, which comprised a WW1 155mm barrel on the carriage of a pre-WWl design. Produced by Schneider, it had been accepted in 1917. At the start of May 1940, 407 L 17 S had been mobilized in France to equip groupes d'artillerie lourde de corps d'armee—corps heavy artillery groups, each with twelve guns. In addition, over a hundred more were formed into other such groupes in the general reserve.</p>
<p>France retained large stocks of other heavy artillery designs from WW1 and earlier, ranging in caliber from 120mm to 280mm, some of which dated as far back as 1877. A small number were even self-propelled—but in the rapid war of movement that swept across France in 1940, few of these archaic and unwieldy pieces could be put to effective use.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.5) [EXC: NA in Norway], and 11/42-5/43 (1.6).</p>

Mitrailleuse de 13.2 CAJ mle 30:</span> Designed and manufactured by Hotchkiss, this was a twin-barreled 13.2mm MG on a heavy tripod mount. 540 (including a small number of single-barrel versions) had been delivered by the start of May 1940, but a shortage of ammunition kept many from being used. They were employed in independent sections of two guns (four tubes), either attached directly to the various armies or providing low-altitude protection for AA guns of ≥ 75mm. Due to its weight, the CAJ mle 30 was adopted by neither the infantry nor the cavalry. Small numbers were exported to Belgium, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R., while the Japanese produced their own copy (<a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhjapaneseordnancenotes.htm#20" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note 20</a>). Those captured by the Germans were used either in the standard AA role or incorporated into the Atlantic Wall defenses. The 1st Free French Division had six when it invaded Syria in June 1941. &quot;CA&quot; stands for Contre Avions (&quot;AA&quot;), and &quot;J&quot; for Jumele (&quot;twin&quot;).</p>

However, it may be carried on a vehicle in the same manner as a 76-107mm MTR (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>).

<p>† (Vichy) French Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.3) [EXC: NA in Norway], 6/41-12/42 (1.6), and 1-5/43 (1.5). For Free French they are 6-7/41 (1.4).</p>

Mitrailleuse de 20 CA mle 39 O:</span> This weapon was ordered from the Swiss firm of Oerlikon in late 1939. By the time the Germans launched their attack in the West, 357 had been received by the French. It was intended that the CA would be provided with an AA section of four Oerlikons to replace four of its Hotchkiss MG. This was never achieved in full, but all seven of the DIM and more than a dozen other infantry-type divisions had at least a complement of the guns by May 10th 1940. Some sources allege that the French also acquired a license to produce the CA 39 O. In the colonies, the CA 39 O was sometimes mounted on the bed of a truck for greater mobility.</p>
<p>† When using Limbered Fire, the Barrel Length modification (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">C4.1</a>) on the counter's LF side is used for To Hit purposes but the AP Basic To Kill number is still determined using the Caliber Size and Length printed on the unlimbered side.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.3) [EXC: NA in Norway], 7/40-5/41 (1.5), 6/41-10/42 (1.6), 11/42-5/43 (1.4), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.5).</p>

Canon Automatique de 25 CA mle 38:</span> Aircraft tactics during the Spanish Civil War led to a French requirement for a light AA gun of larger than MG caliber, in order to engage planes flying at higher altitudes. This ultimately resulted in the 25mm CA 38 and CA 39, produced by Hotchkiss. (The CA 39 featured a stronger platform and carriage, but in game terms the two guns are equivalent.) A twin-barrel version—the CAJ mle 40—was also designed, but appeared too late to see much action. By May 10th 1940, 512 CA 38 and 62 CA 39 had been delivered—but at the end of April a total of only 327 had actually been mobilized in France (another 62 were in Africa and the Levant). A further 159 and 96 (respectively) of the two models were delivered before the June armistice. At the time of the German invasion 39 batteries were assigned to the various armies, while the three DLM, the seven DIM and three other infantry-type divisions contained one organic batterie apiece. During the campaign, all five DLC, the 4th DCR and fifteen other infantry divisions also received a batterie. All of these batteries normally comprised six guns. Each batterie of W15T CC was authorized four CA 39 (see <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#21" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 21</a>). Most of the 25mm AA guns captured by the Germans were issued to occupation troops in France; in June 1944 the Luftwaffe had 639 in service. The French 25mm AA appears to have been the inspiration for the Soviet and Japanese AA weapons of that caliber.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.4) [EXC: 1.5 for Norway], and 6/41-5/43 (1.5) [EXC: 1.6 for Madagascar, 5/42 and 9/42].</p>
<p><a id="21"></a><img src="freno044.jpg" width="165" height="76" alt="FrenO044" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">21. Canon de 75 CA mle 32:</span> This was the most numerous mobile AA gun available to the French in 1940. It was accepted for service in 1932, but production was delayed by the need to incorporate several important design changes (for which reason many sources refer to this gun as the mle 36). 332 had been delivered by May 10th, 1940—plus another 24 later in that month. The game piece also represents three other types of mobile 75mm AA guns: the mle 17/34, the mle 30 and the mle 33, of which 127, 132 and 192 (respectively) were available at the time of the German invasion. The French employed more than 600 statically mounted 75mm AA guns as well. 149 75mm AA guns (probably including both static and mobile types) were present in Vichy North Africa in November 1942. One drawback common to all of the mobile 75mm guns was their long setup time of 20-30 minutes. In addition, while the mle 32 could be towed at speeds of up to 24 mph, the others were limited to only about 6 mph. A batterie normally comprised four guns. The mle 32 was kept in production by the Germans; in June 1944 they had 580 captured French 75mm AA guns on mobile carriages in service.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.5) [EXC: NA in Norway], 7/40-7/41 (1.6), 11/42-5/43 (1.6), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="p_Heading1"><span class="f_Heading1">LEND-LEASE ORDNANCE</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States supplied the French with a total of 1,694 artillery, anti-tank and AA guns through the Lend-Lease program. In addition, more were doubtlessly given via direct transfers in-theater, which were not always included in Lend-Lease calculations. Britain and Canada also provided much equipment, though the exact quantities remain unclear. With a few exceptions, Free French units operating under British or U.S. command were organized along the same lines as their respective Allied counterparts.</p>

All pertinent data and Notes relating to the characteristics and game capabilities of each weapon apply as given originally for it in YANKS/WOA except as noted otherwise.

<p><a id="22"></a><span class="f_Strong">22. U.S. &amp; British Mortars:</span> The mortars initially available to the Free French were primarily those they possessed when they declared for de Gaulle. Britain soon began supplying 2-in. and 3-in. models (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishordnancenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">British Ordnance Notes 1</a> and <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishordnancenotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">2</a>), but these were used mostly for training except when the supply of French mortars was insufficient. The fall of Vichy Syria and Lebanon provided enough French mortars and ammunition to fully equip the Free French in the British 8th Army until the end of 1942.</p>
<p>A total of 1,504 U.S. mortars were Lend-Leased to the French. The M2 60mm (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note 1</a>) was used three per infantry company, and the M1 81mm (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note 3</a>) was issued six per infantry battalion, just as in American units.</p>
<p>† 2-in Mortar Dates and RF for DYO purchase purposes are 9/40-5/41 (1.3) and 8/41-4/43 (1.6). For 6-7/41 and 5-11/43, use the Free French SW Allotment Chart.</p>
<p>† 3-in. Mortar RF is 1.5 for 9/40-5/41, 1.2 for 6-7/41, 1.6 for 8/41-4/43, and 1.1 for 5-11/43.</p>

The 1st Free French Division had nine (survivors of the 1940 Norwegian expedition) when it invaded Syria in June 1941, but at the end of that campaign it acquired more. 18 were used at Bir Hakeim in May 1942, with each infantry battalion of the 1st BFL having four (one battalion had six), some of which were mounted on Carriers (see <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#31" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 31</a>).</p>

Later, the divisions outfitted by the Americans were issued M1 57mm guns (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#7" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note 7</a>).

Only a single battery of four was included in the 1st Free French Division when it invaded Syria in June 1941; however, dozens more became available at the end of that campaign. 54 were available at Bir Hakeim in May 1942—six (as anti-tank guns) per infantry battalion, six in the 1st Anti-Tank Company, and 24 in the 1st Artillery Regiment. Most were lost in that battle, and the gun's prominence diminished significantly thereafter.</p>
