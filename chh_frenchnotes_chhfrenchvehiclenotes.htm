<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1921, all aspects of French tank design, development and use were given to the Infantry arm, which saw close support of the foot soldier as the true function of armor. To this end, various types of light, medium and heavy chars (&quot;tanks&quot;) were developed throughout the '20s and '30s. In 1931 a separate tank arm for the Cavalry was created—but its tracked AFV, like its armored cars, were required to be designated automitrailleuses (&quot;machinegun cars&quot;) since legally only the Infantry could possess chars. This separation (which also existed in the U.S. Army at the time) led to much duplication of effort and ultimately to the fielding of many different designs. (In May 1940, no less than nine different basic tank types—excluding the FT-17—were in French service.) In 1935 this distinction was finally dropped, and all new tanks were called chars regardless of whether intended for infantry or cavalry use.</p>
<p>French infantry tanks, though well-armored, were generally slow with a short radius of action, and the lighter models carried a small-caliber low-velocity gun with a limited supply of AP ammunition—all of which belied their role of support for the foot soldier. Moreover, the use of one-man turrets and poor or no radio equipment made all French tanks tactically clumsy and inefficient. On the other hand, they were usually well-built, and the newer, larger tanks had guns with better anti-tank performance than those of the Germans. Despite the fact that France's first divisional-sized armored unit—the 1st DLM—was created a year before the appearance of the first panzer division, the defensive-minded French failed to grasp the striking power of combined-arms tank formations used en masse. When the Germans launched their attack with approximately 2,500 tanks (of which only about 1,000 had a gun of &gt; 37mm) concentrated in ten panzer divisions, the 3,132 French tanks (excluding FT-17) opposing them were spread out among 30+ independent tank battalions and companies, three DCR (plus a fourth in the process of creation), three DLM and five DLC. To make matters worse, these tank units were themselves dispersed more or less all along the front. In the end, the Germans' advantages in tactics, organization and experience proved stunningly decisive despite both their inferiority in number of tanks (not even counting the 300 British tanks in France at that time) and the gun/armor superiority of certain Allied models.</p>

FT-17M, FT-17C &amp; FT-17 75BS:</span> With its revolutionary combination of 360°-traverse armament, rear-mounted engine and fully tracked chassis, the FT-17 was the direct ancestor of the modern tank. Designed and developed by Col. (later Gen.) Jean-Baptiste Estienne and the industrialist Louis Renault, and known officially as the Char Leger Renault FT mle 1917 (&quot;FT&quot; being the production code assigned by Renault), almost 3,200 of various models had been manufactured by the end of WW1, with the number rising postwar to some 3,800. First to be built was the MG-armed FT-17 Mitrailleuse, followed by the FT-17 Canon with a 37mm gun derived from the infantry support weapon, and then the FT-17 75BS with a Blockhaus Schneider 75mm howitzer. (A fourth type, not included in the game, was an unarmed radio vehicle designated the FT-17 TSF.) Due to its slow speed, short range of 12-21 miles and general fragility, the FT-17 was usually transported by truck for journeys of any length. FT-17 were exported to a large number of foreign countries after WW1, and saw more action between the wars (including use by both sides in the Spanish Civil War) than any other tank type. In the 1930s the FT-17M received a newer type of MG; this version is referred to in some sources as the FT-31. Modified versions of the FT-17 were built in the U.S.A. (the 6 Ton Tank), Italy (the Fiat 3000; <a href="chh_italiannotes_chhitalianvehiclenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">Italian Vehicle Note 1</a>) and the U.S.S.R. (the KS and MS series). In May 1940 the French still possessed almost 1600, of which some 536 were on active duty in France, equipping nine BCC (most of which were behind the Maginot Line), three CACC, and about a hundred independent sections used primarily for the defense of certain cities, airfields and military installations. In addition, 244 were stationed in French North Africa, 54 in the Levant, and one company in Indo-China. A section (i.e., platoon) theoretically comprised a mixture of five FT-17M and FT-17C plus one FT-17 75BS; independent sections, however, contained five FT-17M. The Germans captured hundreds of FT-17, and used them in action on a few occasions; e.g., one FT-17C at Dieppe in 1942 (which allegedly managed to immobilize a Churchill), and seventeen FT-17 that operated against the Paris Resistance in August 1944.</p>
<p>† Minimum road-MP cost is one MP; i.e., no FT-17 may use the V2-MP road rate even if CE—as signified by &quot;Road Rate NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Dates for all three versions are 5-6/40 [EXC; NA in Norway], 6-7/41, 11/42 (NA vs Axis), and 3/45 (Indo-China; FT-17M and FT-17C only).</p>

AMR 33:</span> In 1932 a requirement for the AMR (Automitrailleuse de Reconnaissance) class of cavalry AFV was issued. The AMR was to be fully tracked, fast and lightly armed, with local reconnaissance as its designated role. The first vehicle of this type to be accepted was the AMR 33, of which 120 were built, all by Renault. In service it was found to suffer from fragile tracks and suspension. When the Germans invaded, AMR 33 were being used in the 5th, 3rd, 14th and 15th RDP of the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th DLC respectively, with a half-squadron of eleven (two five-vehicle platoons) in each of the RDP's two battalions; each platoon usually worked in conjunction with a motorcycle platoon. In June 1940, the 4th RAM of the newly forming 7th DLM received fifteen AMR 33.</p>
<p>† Availability is limited to 5-6/40 (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhmultifrenchvehnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note E</a> also applies).</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="frenv008.jpg" width="248" height="75" alt="FrenV008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. AMR 35 &amp; AMR 35(L):</span> A number of significant modifications to the AMR 33 led to the AMR 35 which, thanks to its bigger engine and improved suspension, was faster and more maneuverable than its predecessor despite being slightly larger and heavier. 167 MG-armed AMR 35 were built, all by Renault; approximately half carried the more potent 13.2mm MG. (Ten others were equipped with a bow-mounted 25mm anti-tank gun, but these saw little if any action.) &quot;(L)&quot; in the piece name stands for &quot;late model&quot;, since the French did not distinguish between the MG-armed versions. On May 10th, 1940, AMR 35/35(L) were being used in the 1st and 4th RDP of the 2nd and 1st DLM respectively, with one squadron of 23 (five per platoon) in each of the RDP's three battalions; in addition, eight were present in the 1st GRDI of the 5th DIM. In June of that year, several squadrons of AMR 35/35(L) were issued to the 14th and 31st RDP of the newly forming 7th DLM.</p>

<p><a id="4"></a><img src="frenv010.jpg" width="167" height="75" alt="FrenV010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. R35:</span> The Char Leger mle 1935 Renault (as the R35 was officially designated) was the light tank design chosen to replace the FT-17 in the infantry-support role. At the time it was quite novel in being of largely cast construction. Its MA was the same as that of the FT-17C, and its suspension was based on that of the AMR 35. In May 1940 about 900 were on active service in France, wholly equipping twenty (and partially equipping two more) independent BCC allocated to the various armies. No R35 were assigned to the DLC or DLM; de Gaulle's 4th DCR contained three R35-equipped BCC (the 2nd, 24th and 44th), and later the attached 3rd Cuirassiers were partially re-equipped with forty R35—but none of the other three DCR used R35 until late-May/early-June, when each received one or more R35-equipped BCC to replace losses. In June 1941, the 6th and 7th RCA in the Levant possessed some 48 R35 each. In November 1942, about 140 R35 were used in the 1st (and probably the 11th) RCA in Morocco and the 2nd RCA in Algeria. In an R35 BCC a section normally comprised three, while a compagnie had thirteen, such AFV. In RCA, however, R35 were organized in two escadrons (squadrons) of four five-tank pelotons (platoons) each. One source states that 1,464 R35 had been built by May 1940, plus another 146 prior to the French surrender; others, however, allege that some 2,000 were built. In either case, the R35 was the most common tank in French (and Vichy) service in 1940-42. Of those produced, 190 were exported: 50 each to Poland, Yugoslavia and Turkey, and 40 to Romania.</p>
<p>Captured R35 were used by the Germans primarily in France and the Balkans (though some sources allege that 200 were sent to the Eastern Front in 1941 for use as recon vehicles). The Germans also converted numbers of R35 to other uses, perhaps the most common example being the Panzerjager 35R(f) carrying an ex-Czech 47mm anti-tank gun (<a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#44" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 44</a>). More than a hundred captured R35 were turned over to Italy (<a href="chh_italiannotes_chhitalianvehiclenotes.htm#11" class="topiclink">Italian Vehicle Note 11</a>).</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 39-5/40 (1.0) [EXC: NA in Norway], 6/40 (1.1), 6-7/41 (1.1), and 11/42 (NA vs Axis; 1.2).</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="frenv013.jpg" width="165" height="75" alt="FrenV013" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. H35:</span> This tank, known officially as the Char Leger mle 1935 Hotchkiss, was designed to compete with the R35 for the infantry-tank production contract. Initially rejected for that use, it was adopted by the cavalry to complement the S35 (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#12" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 12</a>) in the DLM. The R35 and H35 were very similar in construction and appearance, both being largely of cast construction and using the same turret. 400 H35 were built, with 300 going to the cavalry of the DLC, DLM and GRDI, and 100 to the independent 13th and 38th BCC for infantry support. In May 1940, the 4th Cuirassiers and 18th Dragoons in the 1st DLM, and the 13th and 29th Dragoons in the 2nd DLM, contained two H35 squadrons (i.e., one groupe d'escadrons) apiece—while the 2nd Battalion of the 11th RDP in the 3rd DLM contained one squadron of H35. Each such squadron ideally comprised four five-tank platoons. In addition, the lst-4th RAM in (respectively) the lst-4th DLC each had a squadron of sixteen H35 (comprising three five-tank platoons), as did the 5th GRDI of the 25th DIM. In June of 1940, the 4th RAM in the newly formed 7th DLM contained two squadrons of H35.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5/40 (1.2) and 6/40 (1.3).</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="frenv015.jpg" width="165" height="75" alt="FrenV015" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. &nbsp;FCM 36:</span> Built by the firm of Forges et Chartiers de la Mediterranee to increase the number of infantry-support tanks, the Char Leger mle 1936 FCM had several unusual features for a French light tank. Both its hull and turret were of entirely welded construction, and it was the only production French tank of the time to have a diesel engine. Its armor was thin but well-sloped to increase its ballistic effectiveness. Due to their high cost, only a hundred FCM 36 were built, of which ninety were used to equip the 4th and 7th BCC assigned to the 2nd Army. 29 were lost on 14 May during a counterattack by the 7th BCC near Chemery, nine miles south of Sedan.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.4 for 5/40 and 1.5 for 6/40.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="frenv017.jpg" width="246" height="75" alt="FrenV017" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. H39:</span> This was an improved version of the H35, featuring a modified suspension and more powerful engine. Some sources refer to it as the H38, but this was not a French designation. Some 600 were built prior to May 1940, plus about another 100 by late June of that year. H39 were issued to the 25th and 26th BCC of the 1st DCR, the 14th and 27th BCC of the 2nd DCR, the 42nd and 45th BCC of the 3rd DCR, the 342nd CACC (which saw action in Norway and later, as the Free French 1st Compagnie de Chars, in Syria), and the 351st CACC. In the 3rd DLM, the 1st and 2nd Cuirassiers each contained two H39 squadrons (i.e., one groupe d'escadrons) while the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 11th Dragons Portes contained one H39 squadron apiece. Each such squadron comprised four five-tank platoons. The 5th RAM of the 5th DLC contained a squadron of sixteen H39 (three five-tank platoons), as did the 2nd GRDI of the 9th DIM. In June, the 7th Cuirassiers received one squadron of H39 while the 4th and 8th RAM of the newly formed 7th and 4th DLM received two and one H39 squadron(s) respectively.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5/40 (1.1), 6/40 (1.2), and 6-7/41 (Free French only; 1.3).</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="frenv019.jpg" width="249" height="226" alt="FrenV019" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. H39(L), H35(L) &amp; R35(L):</span> The relatively poor anti-tank performance of the 37mm mle 1916 TR infantry gun during the Spanish Civil War led the French to redesign the SA 18 version used in their light tanks. This resulted in the more powerful SA 38, of which 358 were installed in H35, H39 and a few R35 in 1940 just prior to the German invasion. Several hundred more SA 38 were manufactured in May-June of that year. The upgunned H35 and H39 were issued to the DCR and DLM, mainly as section/platoon leader vehicles in the battalions equipped with the same type of tanks. The R35(L) were probably employed in the same manner in a few of the R35-equipped BCC—however, at least one source states that none were used in the 2nd, 24th or 44th BCC of the 4th DCR (at the end of May some were issued to the 1st Battalion of the 1st Polish Tank Regiment in France).</p>
<p>Several sources refer to the upgunned R35 as the R39, and call the H39 the H38 while naming the upgunned version the H39; however, &quot;H38&quot; and &quot;R39&quot; were not official French designations. In fact, French nomenclature did not distinguish at all between the differently armed versions, so &quot;(L)&quot; (for &quot;late model&quot;) has been added to the piece names for game purposes. Some of the R35, H35 and H39 equipped with the original SA 18 gun were modernized by their German captors, who retrofitted them with the SA 38. A small number of recaptured R35(L) and H39(L) were used by the Free French in 1944.</p>
<p>† R35(L) Dates are 5-6/40, and 9/44-5/45 (Free French only). H35(L) Dates and RF are 5/40 (1.3) and 6/40 (1.4). H39(L) Dates and RF are 5/40 (1.2), 6/40 (1.3), and 9/44-5/45 (1.6; Free French only).</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="frenv021.jpg" width="168" height="74" alt="FrenV021" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. R40:</span> In 1939 the Moulineaux arsenal (AMX) developed a new type of track and suspension (derived in part from the Char B tank) for the R35. The resulting variant, designated the R40 (a.k.a. the R35 AMX or AMX 40), went into production in March 1940. Exactly how many were built is not known; however, in May of that year the 40th and 48th BCC each contained thirty R40 and fifteen R35, and in June another two dozen or so were issued to the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Polish Tank Regiment at Camp de Satory near Paris—so it would seem that 80+ were constructed. A few R40 were seized by the Paris Resistance in August 1944. All production R40 carried the more powerful SA 38 gun.</p>
<p>A BCC containing chars legers (other than FT-17) normally comprised three compagnies de chars (each with four three-tank sections and one command tank), plus a compagnie d'echelon of six replacement tanks (one of which was usually used by the BCC's commanding officer). A CACC of such tanks comprised a compagnie de chars plus (usually) two replacement tanks.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="frenv023.jpg" width="167" height="75" alt="FrenV023" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. D1:</span> The Char Moyen D1 was a Renault light-tank design derived (via the NC tank of the 1920s) from the FT-17 and the intended successor to the latter in the infantry-support role. It entered series production in 1932; by 1935 when its manufacture ended, some 160 had been built and it had been reclassified as a medium (moyen) tank. The D1 was issued to the 61st, 65th and 67th BCC, all of which were sent to Tunisia in 1937 to guard the border with Italian Libya. In June 1940 the 67th BCC returned to France where it fought against the 6th and 8th Panzer Divisions. All but about 60 of the 107 D1 remaining in Vichy North Africa were disarmed by order of the Germans after France surrendered. By November 1942 only fifteen (the 7th Squadron of the 4th RCA) were immediately available to contest the Axis occupation of Tunisia, while several squadrons of the 9th RCA engaged elements of the U.S. 1st Armored Division south of Oran. Afterwards, about 45 D1 of the 5th and 9th RCA were sent to reinforce the French in Tunisia. A D1 platoon in French North Africa comprised five such tanks, while a squadron had four platoons.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 6/40 (1.5) and 11/42-3/43 (1.4).</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><img src="frenv025.jpg" width="339" height="75" alt="FrenV025" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. D2 &amp; D2(L): </span>The Char Moyen D2, derived essentially from the Dl and intended as its successor in the infantry-support role, was faster, larger and more heavily armored than its predecessor. An order for fifty was placed with Renault in January 1934, but was not completed until 1938 due to a diversion of funds to the development of the Char B. A contract for another fifty was awarded in June 1938; these were not built until early 1940, and differed from the first batch by having the same turret and 47mm gun as the S35 and Char Bl-bis; &quot;(L)&quot; for (&quot;late model&quot;) has been added to the piece name of this version since French nomenclature did not distinguish between the two models. The Chars D2 and some D2(L) were assigned to the 19th BCC, which for a time in May 1940 was part of de Gaulle's 4th DCR. The remaining D2(L) were used to form the 345th (also assigned to the 4th DCR), 346th and 350th CACC. Those BCC and CACC containing chars moyens were organized in the same way as those equipped with chars legers (see <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#9" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 9</a>).</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for both versions are 5/40 (1.5) and 6/40 (1.6).</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><img src="frenv027.jpg" width="246" height="75" alt="FrenV027" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">12. S35:</span> Designed by the Societe d'Outillage Mecanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie, a subsidiary of the Schneider firm, the S35 was based loosely on the Char D2. At first it was designated an Automitrailleuse de Combat (AMC—escort AFV for the AMR and AMD reconnaissance vehicles). However, it performed so well that the cavalry decided to use it as the standard medium tank in the new DLM. (The infantry arm refused to adopt it.) Officially called the Char de Cavalerie mle 1935 SOMUA, the S35 represented a notable advance in AFV design, for it was the first production tank of entirely cast construction: the hull was a single bathtub-shaped casting, while the superstructure consisted of one casting to cover the engine compartment and another over the rest of the hull; the APX-4 turret was a single cast piece also. 430 (some say 450) S35 were built. At the start of the German invasion, two S35 squadrons (forming one groupe d'escadrons) apiece had been issued to the 4th Cuirassiers and 18th Dragoons of the 1st DLM, to the 13th and 29th Dragoons of the 2nd DLM, and to the 1st and 2nd Cuirassiers of the 3rd DLM. The 3rd Cuirassiers also had one S35 groupe, while in June 1940 the 7th Cuirassiers and 8th RAM received one such escadron each. As part of the Groupement Blinde Francais, one escadron of the 12th RCA used 23 S35 vs Axis troops in Tunisia (these tanks had been evacuated from France in June 1940, and were transported overland to Tunisia from Dakar). An S35 escadron comprised 23 tanks, with four pelotons (platoons) of five tanks each. Due to its good gun, armor and speed, it was considered by many to be the best tank of its day; unfortunately, combat showed these factors to be largely offset by the limitations of its one-man turret and poor radio equipment.</p>
<p>The Germans captured 297 S35, thirty of which they gave to the Italians (who assigned them to the garrison of Sardinia); the rest they used in the Balkans, France and on the Eastern Front. In 1945, sixteen S35 in the 1st Squadron of the Free French 13th Dragoons saw action along the southwest coast of France.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5/40 (1.2) [EXC: NA in Norway], 6/40 (1.3), 4-5/43 (1.3), and 3-4/45 (Free French only; 1.5).</p>

B1-bis:</span> Intended originally as a heavy infantry-support tank, the first prototype of the Char B appeared in January 1929. Testing and altered design requirements resulted in the Char Bl, which entered service at the end of 1935. 35 of this model were built (but in 1940 were being used as training vehicles and consequently saw little or no combat). Further modifications led to the Char de Bataille B1-bis which, compared to its predecessor, featured heavier armor, a bigger engine, and a more powerful gun in a new turret. The Bl-bis was a sophisticated and powerful weapon for its time, but suffered from a number of drawbacks, among which were its one-man turret, poor communications equipment, relatively slow speed and short radius of action, and a complexity that hampered mass production. The turret and gun were the same as used on the S35. The bow-mounted 75mm howitzer and MG were aimed and fired by the driver. They could be elevated, but had no lateral traverse; i.e., the tank itself had to be turned in order to aim them horizontally. For this purpose a hydrostatically controlled auxiliary differential allowed infinitely fine variations in steering. This system was quite complex, however, and prone to breakdowns. By May 10th 1940, some 243 were deployed in combat units. They formed the main striking force of the DCR, equipping the 28th and 37th BCC of the 1st DCR, the 8th and 15th BCC of the 2nd DCR, the 41st and 49th BCC of the 3rd DCR, and the 46th and 47th BCC of the 4th DCR. They were also used to form the 347th-349th, 352nd and 353rd CACC. In late June a few were issued to the 10th BCC as well. A B1-bis section normally comprised three, and a compagnie ten, such AFV. A total of 368 were built. In action, the armor of the B1-bis proved nearly impervious to all but the German 88, aside from a vulnerable engine grille on the port-side hull (very few German units actually discovered this Achilles' heel during the fighting). Many B1-bis, however, were lost prematurely through breakdown or fuel shortage.</p>
<p>Of the 161 B1-bis captured by the Wehrmacht, 60 were converted to flamethrower tanks in 1941-42 by substituting a flame gun for the 75mm and adding an armored fuel container at the rear of the vehicle; these saw action in France, Holland (some being used against British paratroopers around Arnhem), the Balkans and the Crimea. 16 more were converted to SP 105mm howitzers. The Free French used 17 recaptured Bl-bis to form the 2nd Squadron of the 13th Dragoons, which fought along the Gironde river in 1945.</p>
<p>† The 47 is a 1MT Gun, while the 75* SA is a bow-mounted NT Gun. Either the MA or SA can claim the possibility of armor-leader direction, but only the one that fires first in a phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase) can actually use it.</p>
<p>† The 75* SA cannot use Intensive Fire—as signified by &quot;No IF75&quot; on the counter.</p>

<p>† The 75* SA receives an extra +1 TH DRM when firing at a moving/-Motion target—as signified by a white dot beside the SA designation on the counter. Whenever the 75* SA fires at a moving/Motion target and/or without using an Acquired-Target DRM, and whenever the BMG fires at a target that is not currently Acquired by the 75* SA, all Acquisition currently held by the 47 MA is immediately lost.</p>
<p>† In addition to normal CH possibilities, a hit on the port-side hull of a B1-bis achieved by a weapon using the Vehicle Target Type (or a LATW TH Table) is a CH if its Original TH DR was a &quot;3&quot;.</p>

About thirty were modified by the Vichy army in Syria in 1940-41 by adding 12mm armor plates around the flatbed, an armored visor for the windshield, and a pedestal-mounted 37mm mle 16 TR gun with coaxial LMG. They were issued to the 6th (and possibly the 7th) RCA and used in five-vehicle platoons. Those captured by the Free French were later employed as reconnaissance vehicles in North Africa by the 1st BIM (Bataillon d'Infanterie de Marine) of the 1st BFL.

Its combination of rear-mounted engine, four-wheel drive, front and rear drivers, and 25mm main armament made it one of the more advanced and powerful recon vehicles of the pre- and early-war period. On the downside, it lacked independent sus pension, and only command versions were radio-equipped. On May 10th 1940 some 480 existed, of which about 360 had been issued to units in the field. Another 47 were built in May-June of that year. The 6th, 8th and 12th Cuirassiers of (respectively) the 1st, 2nd and 3rd DLM each contained two squadrons of AMD 35, each of which comprised four five-vehicle platoons (with each platoon normally accompanied by a platoon of motorcycle infantry—the combination being referred to as a Detachement de Decouverte or DD). Similarly, the RAM of each DLC and the GRDI of each DIM was authorized a squadron of sixteen AMD 35 in three platoons. Each BCP was authorized (but the 4th BCP of the 4th DCR lacked) one section of five AMD plus another of motorcyclists. Several other miscellaneous formations employed it as well (e.g., the 32nd GRDI; the 6th and 10th Cuirassiers, and 8th RAM, in June).</p>

Laffly W15T Chasseur de Chars:</span> The idea of mounting the powerful 47mm anti-tank gun on a cross-country truck was first put forth in the fall of 1939. The following January a prototype was constructed, using the 6x6 chassis of a Laffly-Hotchkiss W15T with the gun welded onto the bed pointing to the rear. Aside from being open-topped over the gun, the vehicle was also completely armored. Trials proved successful, but production did not begin for several months. Finally, between the 24th of May and the 17th of June, seventy W15T CC were built. Unfortunately, given the desperate military situation at that time, most of the armor protection envisaged in the original design had to be omitted in order to speed up production. As the vehicles came off the assembly line they were assigned to newly forming independent anti-tank batteries which, after only a day or two of training, were rushed to the front. Each batterie ideally comprised five W15T CC, four towed or SP 25mm AA guns and miscellaneous support vehicles. They performed well in action (the 54th Batterie was credited with destroying 28 tanks and five armored cars in eight days), but suffered heavy losses in the process. Chasseur de Chars means &quot;Tank Hunter&quot;.</p>

Incorporated into several artillery regiments, they apparently saw action only in Tunisia. At the other end of the Mediterranean, a Lieutenant Conus of the Free French designed an armored SP version of the same gun in early 1942, using a Canadian Ford F60L 4x4 3-ton lorry and the turret-traverse parts from an Italian tank. About 12 &quot;Conus guns&quot; were built, eventually forming the 3rd Squadron of the 1st RMSM (Regiment de Marche de Spahis Marocains) armored car unit which fought as part of the British 8th Army.</p>

However, it appears that relatively few vehicles were so altered, and that most were field rather than standardized modifications. The MG-armed versions were used mainly for convoy/column escort. The motorcycle reconnaissance section in the 5th, 17th and 16th BCP of (respectively) the 1st, 2nd and 3rd DCR contained a few truck-mounted AAMG. Several (perhaps three) W15T CC batteries (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#19" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 19</a>) employed Autocanons de 25 CA in lieu of towed 25mm AA guns.

Production continued after the war, and in the 1930s a modernization program was carried out (e.g., to allow accurate fire at ground targets). No ammunition was carried aboard the vehicle itself; instead, a second vehicle of the same type—but carrying an ammo caisson in place of the gun—accompanied it in action. On May 10th 1940, 236 Autocanons de 75 mle 13/34 were available in France, employed in four-gun batteries, with between one and four groupes (of three batteries apiece) attached to each field army. Eight such groupes participated in the defense of Dunkirk. Other batteries/groupes were used in several of France's overseas possessions.

Successive improvements led ultimately to the P16, of which 100 were built—all for the cavalry. In 1932 its name was changed to Automi-trailleuse de Combat mle 1929. In May 1940, a total of about seventy AMC 29 were still being used in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th GRDI of the 5th, 12th, 15th, 3rd and 1st DIM respectively—a squadron of 16 (three five-vehicle platoons) being authorized in each.

Citroen-Kegresse P17 &amp; P19:</span> The very first halftracks, designed by Adolphe Kegresse for the Tsar of Russia, were built in 1910-1911. After WW1 Kegresse returned to France where he collaborated with Citroen to produce a whole series of halftracks for the French Army in the '20s and early '30s. The most numerous of these was the small Citroen-Kegresse P17, first ordered in 1929 and built mainly for towing the motorized version of the mle 1897 75mm field gun. By 1940 most had been replaced by the Unic P107 (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#27" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 27</a>), but some were being issued as prime movers for the 25mm AA gun, and for the 47mm anti-tank gun in the motorized BDAC of the DLM, DLC, DCR and DIM. Overseas, P17 also remained in use as 75mm artillery tractors. 1,442 P17 tracteurs d'artillerie legere were in French service in September 1939. One source of dissatisfaction with the P17 was its inability to transport a gun, its crew and ammunition all in one vehicle. A batch of Citroen-Kegresse halftracks (including a P17) purchased by the U.S. Army in the early 1930s was the direct inspiration for the family of American halftracks used in WW2.</p>
<p>The P19 first appeared in 1930, and was produced in two main types: the VLTT P19B, a cross-country liaison vehicle of which about 600 were built (in 1940 each infantry regiment was authorized six, with others assigned to various motorized, mechanized and armored units); and the VDP P19, designed to transport the fusiliers portes (i.e., the &quot;infantry&quot;), machine guns and mortars in the RDP of the cavalry divisions. 547 VDP P19 were in service in September 1939, but by May 1940 were apparently used in only one battalion (each) of the 5th and 2nd RDP in the 1st and 3rd DLC respectively (all other such battalions being transported in either 6x6 or lV2-ton 4x2 trucks).</p>
<p>The P17 game piece also represents the P19BT, used for towing (and from 1937 for the en portee transport of) the 25mm anti-tank gun in those RDP battalions equipped with P19.</p>
<p>† Use of these vehicles in Norway is NA. PI 7 Dates otherwise are 39-5/43, and 3/45 (Indo-China).</p>

All were derived from a SOMUA-Kegresse recovery/repair halftrack of the 1920s. One problem with the MCG was that, despite its size, two were needed to transport a gun along with its crew and ammunition. Other drawbacks were its noisy engine/tracks and relatively slow speed. Nevertheless, by the end of June 1940 some 1,500 such tracteurs d'artillerie moyen (inclusive of several variants) had been built. Many were captured by the Germans who, aside from using them as prime movers, modified some for use in the APC role and converted others to armored SP anti-tank guns; these saw action in France in 1944.</p>
<p>† Dates are 5-6/40 [EXC: NA in Norway], 6-7/41, and 11/42-5/43.</p>

Unic P107:</span> By 1934 the French Army increasingly favored the use of 6x6 wheeled vehicles instead of halftracks, but the artillery still preferred the latter. In 1935 a new Citroen-Kegresse halftrack designated the P107 appeared, and after trials was accepted as a tracteur d'artillerie legere for the motorized versions of both the mle 1897 75mm field gun (supplanting the P17 in this role) and the new 105mm howitzer. By the time the first production order was received, however, Citroen had gone bankrupt, so all P107 were built by the Unic firm. By the time of France's surrender 3,276 (inclusive of several variants) had been produced, making the PI07 the most common halftrack in French service.</p>
<p>Of the large number of P107 captured by the Germans, many were converted to partially/fully armored halftracks and issued to units in France for use in the APC role, and for towing anti-tank guns and light artillery.</p>

Renault UE:</span> This chenillette (&quot;small tracked vehicle&quot;) was originally designed to carry a mortar, machine gun and/or ammunition across bullet-swept ground. By 1940, however, it was used primarily as a supply vehicle, and for towing the 25mm anti-tank guns in the CDAC of certain non-motorized infantry-type divisions and in the CD AC, CA and CRME of the DIM. Its official designation was Chenillette de Ravitaillement d'lnfanterie UE mle 1931 Renault—sometimes abbreviated to CRI 31R. (The improved mle 37R version, a.k.a. the UE 2, was introduced in the late '30s; both types are equivalent in game terms.) One drawback to the design was its inability to transport a weapon plus its ammunition and crew—the latter having to either ride in another vehicle (in motorized units) or walk (in leg-infantry units). A very small number of UE were built with a partially raised superstructure to house a ball-mounted LMG. About 3,300 UE types had been issued to units in France by May 10th 1940, with another 1,278 in various vehicle parks and depots. A total of some 5,150 of both models had been built by the end of that month. A leg-infantry regiment was normally authorized nine UE, used mainly for transporting supplies but also available for the emergency movement of heavy weapons. A motorized infantry regiment was authorized eighteen UE, twelve of which were prime movers for the regiment's twelve 25mm anti-tank guns. Thousands of UE were captured by the Germans, who used them not only as supply vehicles and light gun tractors, but also converted some to MG carriers (similar to the French BMG version) or to carry a 37mm anti-tank gun on the superstructure, or to mobile launchers for 280/320mm rockets.</p>
<p>† Each Passenger SMC counts as one Passenger PP, and is considered always CE (as if in a Carrier; <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.84" class="topiclink">D6.84</a>) even if the vehicle's Inherent crew (if any) is BU.</p>

Lorraine 38L:</span> Derived from the Lorraine mle 37 tank supply chenillette, the Vehicule Blinde pour Chasseurs Fortes 38 Lorraine (or VBCP 38L) was a stopgap APC used by the mechanized infantry in the DCR's BCP. It was a most unusual design, in that four members of its passenger squad were carried in the vehicle while the remainder rode in a tracked armored trailer. Of the 240 ordered at the end of 1939, only about 150 had been delivered by the end of May 1940. They were issued to the 5th, 17th and 16th BCP of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd DCR respectively—with the 16th BCP receiving only a partial allotment. The Germans captured more than 300 Lorraine chenillettes of all types, and converted most of them to SP guns; see <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#45" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Notes 45</a> and <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#82" class="topiclink">82</a>.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.4 for 5/40 and 1.5 for 6/40.</p>
<p>† To depict a Lorraine 38L wreck, use a Lorraine 37L 44 Wreck counter with a Scrounged marker on it.</p>
<p>† <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">C10.4-.41</a> apply to the trailer except as stated otherwise below. The trailer's AF are &quot;0&quot;, and it can be disconnected instantly (even if destroyed) by the vehicle's Inherent Driver without need of MP expenditure or losing Motion status [EXC: disconnecting is NA if the trailer is carrying any Passenger Personnel]. Disconnecting is accomplished by the owner's announcing the action in the vehicle's MPh and flipping the trailer over to the side showing no trailer; the extra MP gained may be used immediately if the vehicle is otherwise able and allowed to do so. A disconnected trailer leaves no separate (not even a Wreck) counter, and hence can neither be hooked up again nor become a burning wreck. TK Case A never applies to a trailer. The vehicle's WGT without the trailer is &quot;7&quot;. The trailer is always assumed to be hooked up at the start of a scenario.</p>
<p><img src="frenv067.jpg" width="56" height="54" alt="FrenV067" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />† The vehicle's Passenger capacity is 6PP, and the trailer's is 8PP; both may retain unpossessed SW [EXC: all unpossessed SW aboard a disconnected trailer are immediately eliminated].</p>
<p>Upon loading, each Passenger unit must immediately choose to occupy either the vehicle or the trailer (PP permitting). A squad instantly Deploys (without need of a leader/TC) once it has loaded. All Passengers in the trailer must be placed above a Trailer Passenger counter, whose sole purpose is to show that they occupy the trailer rather than the vehicle. Should the combined Passenger PP total of a crew, or HS, counter and its possessed SW exceed the individual PP capacity of both the trailer and the vehicle, the excess SW must go, unpossessed, into whichever &quot;passenger compartment&quot; it will fit in, and requires the unit carrying it to expend two (instead of the normal one; <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">D6.5</a>) MF to load. Passengers are considered to be stacked together for all purposes [EXC: minefield attacks do not affect the trailer/its-occupants Collaterally; Transfer/Recovery/&quot;movement&quot; directly between the vehicle and trailer are NA; HS cannot Recombine while aboard the vehicle/trailer]. If the vehicle is destroyed, so is the trailer—but in this case each Personnel Passenger in the trailer is assumed to automatically pass a <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.9" class="topiclink">D6.9</a> Survival DR. The cs# of the vehicle is &quot;3&quot;, while that of the trailer is &quot;2&quot;. A hit on this trailer can cause a Collateral Attack. See also <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhmultifrenchvehnotes.htm#h" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note H</a>.</p>
<p>EX: Assume an &quot;empty&quot; Lorraine 38L (i.e., one that is devoid of Passengers) with its trailer attached. A hero, and a squad carrying a LMG, toad onto the Lorraine 38L. The squad now automatically Deploys, with one HS going into the vehicle and the other into the trailer; both the hero and LMG may join either HS in the latter's passenger compartment, or the hero may join one HS and the LMG the other. The ATTACKER must now also place a Trailer Passenger counter so that it is above all of the vehicle's Passengers and beneath all of the trailer's Passengers. If a HS carrying a dm 60mm MTR (3PP) loads onto an &quot;empty&quot; Lorraine 38L, both must occupy the trailer, and a Trailer Passenger counter is placed beneath the two Passenger counters to indicate this. If, however, the HS were carrying a dm 81mm MTR instead, their combined total of nine Passenger PP (5 [HS] + 4 [dm 81mm MTR; <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">C10.31</a> = 9) would exceed the individual PP capacity of both the vehicle and trailer, so the HS would have to expend two MF to load, and if it loads successfully (see the <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.43" class="topiclink">D5.43</a> example) it will be in either the vehicle or trailer (ATTACKER'S choice) while the now-unpossessed MTR will be in whichever passenger compartment the HS does not occupy (and that MTR could be unloaded only by Infantry in the vehicle's Location who Recover it while the vehicle is Stopped). In this case the Trailer Passenger counter would go between the HS and dm 81mm MTR counters. If two CE HS are Passengers aboard a Lorraine 38L, any non-minefield Collateral Attack will affect both of them with the same DR (even if the original attack was a Direct Fire ordnance hit on one of them) since they are considered to be stacked together.</p>

Lorraine 37L 44: </span>After the fall of France, the Lorraine factory at Bagneres de Bigorre undertook the construction of a smaller, unarmored version of the company's chenillette. Built ostensibly for the forest service, the vehicle was nevertheless designed so that armor plates produced secretly in conjunction with each vehicle could be quickly attached to turn the machine into an APC for use by the Resistance. A record was kept of each vehicle's whereabouts, and in the summer of 1944 they were recalled to the factory and their transformation into AFV begun. Designated the Tracteur Lorraine 37L 44, some 30-50 participated in the liberation of southwest France, with about 150 more being made available by the end of the war. In appearance they looked somewhat like the Universal Carriers used by the British.</p>
<p>† The Passenger(s) and Inherent crew of this vehicle are always CE (with all that entails) in the same manner as those in a Carrier (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.84" class="topiclink">D6.84</a>)—as signified by &quot;Always CE&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Contrary to <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.27" class="topiclink">H1.27</a>, this vehicle may be purchased by the Partisan side for a scenario set in France—assuming all of its RF and Date requirements are met. Purchase for an OB that contains no such &quot;French partisan&quot; squads is NA.</p>
<p>† lf the vehicle is manned (or its Removed/Scrounged LMG is being used) by other than &quot;French partisans&quot; or Free French, Captured-use penalties apply.</p>

Latil TAR H2:</span> Latil tractors of various types had been used for hauling French guns since WW1. The TAR H2, adopted in 1934 for towing heavy artillery, featured 4x4 drive and four-wheel steering. By 1940 it was the most common prime mover for the 155mm GPF and was also used for transporting other mobile heavyweights such as the 75mm mle 32 AA gun. Some 600 had been delivered by the time of the French surrender. Afterwards, Latil was taken over by Daimler-Benz, who produced a number of these tractors in a special Ostfront version.</p>
<p>† With a WGT of &quot;4.5&quot;, a Target Size of &quot;0&quot; and a Passenger capacity of &quot;5PP&quot;, this game piece may also be used to represent the Latil KTL4. 163 were built in the latter half of the 1930s, and were used for towing the 105mm L 13 S (<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchordnancenotes.htm#14" class="topiclink">French Ordnance Note 14</a>). For DYO purposes, the KTL4 would be available wherever and whenever the L 13 S ART is, but with a RF of .1 (to a maximum of 1.6) &gt; that of the Gun. BPV for use as the KTL4 is &quot;11&quot;.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5-6/40 (1.5) [EXC: NA in Norway], 7/40-7/41 (1.6), 11/42-5/43 (1.6), and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.6).</p>

Laffly S15T:</span> In 1936 the French Army began ordering a whole series of cross-country wheeled vehicles from the Laffly firm. One of the numerically more important types was the S15T, of which 396 were built for towing 75mm field guns and 105mm field howitzers. By May of 1940 all S15T had been issued to various motorized artillery groupes. Lafflys were 6x6 vehicles (the V15T was a 4x4) of advanced design, with fully independent suspension, two small anti-ditching wheels beside the radiator, and two small anti-bellying wheels below the front seats. The Germans put to use all they could capture, and kept at least one model (the V15T—<a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhfrenchvehiclenotes.htm#34" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note 34</a>) in production. Some German units later used the S15T as a prime mover for the PaK 40 75mm antitank gun.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 39-1/41 (1.5) [EXC: NA in Norway], and 3/45 (Indo-China; 1.4). </p>

Laffly S20TL:</span> The Voiture de Dragons Portes S20TL was Laffly's replacement for the Lorraine 28 truck previously used to transport the fusiliers portes (i.e., the &quot;infantry&quot;) and heavy weapons in the RDP of each DLM. Five main versions were produced: command, squad transport, MG transport, mortar transport, and prime mover for the 25mm anti-tank gun (early versions towed the gun; later ones carried it en portee). &quot;L&quot; in the name stood for Long, indicating a lengthened chassis. A total of 935 S20TL trucks were ordered through the end of May 1940, of which about 630 were delivered—the last 190 or so actually built by Hotchkiss. They were issued to the 1st and 11th RDP of the 2nd and 3rd DLM respectively, to the 7th RDP attached to the 4th DCR, and perhaps to a battalion in one or two of the RDP in DLC. The portee version was also issued to most (if not all) other RDP.</p>
<p>† With a WGT of &quot;6.5&quot;, a Target Size of &quot;0&quot;, and truck-type (instead of armored-car-type—see <a href="chh_frenchnotes_chhmultifrenchvehnotes.htm#j" class="topiclink">French Vehicle Note J</a>) MP expenditures, this game piece may also be used to represent the Lorraine 28 truck, which in 1940 was still being used for troop transport in the 4th RDP of the 1st DLM, and possibly in one or two RDP battalions in DLC. Apparently they partially equipped the 16th BCP of the 3rd DCR as well. BPV for use as the Lorraine 28 is &quot;12&quot;.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 5/40 (1.3) and 6/40 (1.4).</p>

Laffly V15T:</span> This 4x4 vehicle was accepted in August 1938. 100 were delivered during the winter of 1939-40, and about a hundred more—built by Licorne—were produced in May-June of 1940. They were used for towing 25mm anti-tank guns in some/all EDAC. Some German units later used the V15T as a prime mover for the PaK 38 50mm anti-tank gun. The game piece also represents the Latil M7T1, a rival 4x4 design first ordered in February 1939. Its intended use was for towing the 25mm anti-tank guns in the CDAC of the DIM, but as it did not become available until March 1940 it was instead used to transport the 81mm mortars and 25mm anti-tank guns in the CE. About 130 were delivered prior to the armistice.</p>

Peugeot 202, Citroen 23, &amp; Renault AGR2:</span> Like other nationalities, the French Army utilized many different types of softskin vehicles (hence only a token representation is made in the game). In the automobile class over 4,000 Simcas, Renaults and Peugeots were used, plus tens of thousands more cars requisitioned from the public. One car that could be armed for use in combat was the Peugeot 202, a petite four-seater whose convertible version sometimes carried a LMG. About 900 were delivered. They were often employed in GRDI and GRCA, and as replacements for motorcycles and sidecars in some units. In the light truck (camionnette) class, the most common vehicle was the l½-ton Citroen Type 23. Ordered at the time of mobilization in September 1939, about 12,500 were delivered through June of 1940. Some other light trucks used were the 1½-ton Renault ADK and AGC, and the 1.2-ton Peugeot DK5J. One of the most common medium trucks in French service was the 3½-ton Renault AGR2, a cab-over-engine design of which approximately 3,150 were delivered. This game piece also represents the 3½-ton Citroen Type 45, which was produced in greater numbers (about 4,000 in all) but was sometimes used as a SPAA vehicle. Both types were also used as pone-canons; i.e., to carry various kinds of artillery pieces en portee.</p>
<p>The French Army employed some 400,000 cars and trucks in 1940; almost all were 4x2 civilian designs, and about 75% were requisitioned from civilian use. The overall total included a number of trucks purchased from the U.S., including 1,500 Dodge VH-48 3-ton 4x2, several hundred Stude-baker K30 5-ton 4x4, and the GMC ACK 353 l½-ton 4x4 (the last used in the 5th DLC).</p>
<p>† When the Peugeot 202 is bogged, one (only) CX squad (even a prisoner—but not a Guard) on foot expending ≥ four MF in the vehicle's Location (and declared to be assisting its unbogging) thereby allows the owning player to subtract two (one per crew or HS) from the colored dr of its immediately subsequent Unbogging DR.</p>
<p>† The Peugeot 202 's AAMG is always available with a RF of 1.3, and may be Removed. If equipped with the AAMG (even if Removed), its printed Passenger capacity is 4PP.</p>
<p>† lncrease the initial RF by .1 for use after 6/40. Availability is NA for 6/43-2/45 inclusive.</p>

M3A3 &amp; M5A1 Light Tanks: </span>A total of 651 U.S. light tanks were Lend-Leased to the Free French. By D-Day this included 273 M3A3 and 230 M5A1 (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#5" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 5</a>). The entire light tank complement of the 2nd DB consisted of M3A3 when it landed in France, while the 1st and 5th DB (as well as three of the five armored recon battalions organic to Free French infantry divisions) had a mixture of M3A3 and M5A1. The two non-divisional armored recon battalions—the 1st and 2nd Spahis Algeriens—were also equipped with M3A3 but not M5A1.</p>
<p>† M3A3 MA must use red TH numbers in scenarios set prior to 1944—as signified by &quot;Red TH#s (pre 44)&quot; on the counter. <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#f" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes F</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#y" class="topiclink">Y</a> also apply to the Free French M3A3.</p>
<p>† M3A3 RF is 1.2 for 12/43-7/44 and 1.1 thereafter. M5A1 RF is .1 &gt; that of the M3A3 for the corresponding Date.</p>

<p><a id="38"></a><span class="f_Strong">38. Crusader II &amp; III Tanks:</span> In the autumn of 1942, the 1st Free French Tank Company (Compagnie de Chars) was re-equipped with 14 Crusader tanks. Each section had two with 2pdr (40mm) main armament and one Crusader III (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#9" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Notes 9</a> and <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#10" class="topiclink">10</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="39"></a><span class="f_Strong">39. M4, M4A1 &amp; M4A2 Medium Tanks:</span> 382 M4A2 (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#10" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 10</a>) and 274 M4A4 (which in the U.S. color is represented in the game by the M4; see <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#14" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 14</a>) were Lend-Leased to the Free French. Of these, 368 and 268 respectively had been provided by June 1944. They equipped the three tank battalions in each of the three DB, with the 2nd DB receiving only M4A2 while the 1st and 5th DB used both types. Later, small numbers of M4A1 (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#9" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 9</a>) were made available to the DB via in-theater transfer.</p>
<p>† <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#y" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note Y</a> also applies to the Free French M4A2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="40"></a><span class="f_Strong">40. M4A3(75)W, M4A3(76)W &amp; M4A3(105) Medium Tanks, &amp; M4 Tankdozer:</span> During the course of the campaign in Europe, a number of M4A3(75)W, M4A3(76)W and M4A3(105) (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes 13</a>, <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#16" class="topiclink">16</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#17" class="topiclink">17</a> respectively) were transferred in-theater to the Free French. Given that 1944-45 Free French tank battalions used U.S. tables of organization, it is a fairly safe assumption that they also received tankdozers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="41"></a><span class="f_Strong">41. M10 GMC: </span>Initially the U.S. Army wanted to issue M3 GMC halftracks (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#34" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 34</a>) to the Free French, since so many were available in North Africa. The French protested vigorously, however, and in the end new M10 (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#23" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 23</a>) were shipped from America. By mid May of 1944, 115 had been Lend-Leased for use in the TD battalion in each DB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="42"></a><span class="f_Strong">42. Daimler Scout Car:</span> A small number of these (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#42" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 42</a>) were used by the Free French—e.g., the 1st RMSM (Regiment de Marche de Spahis Marocains) contained two in January of 1943.</p>
<p>† RFis 1.5 for 6/41-1/42, 1.4 for 2-9/42, and 1.3 for 10/42-11/43.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="43"></a><span class="f_Strong">43. M3A1 &amp; M20 Scout Cars, &amp; M8 Armored Car:</span> An undetermined number of these AFV (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#39" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes 39</a>, <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#40" class="topiclink">40</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#42" class="topiclink">42</a> respectively) were supplied to the Free French (though a fair guess regarding the M8 would be about 550). One major difference between the U.S. infantry division's table of organization and that of a U.S.-equipped Free French infantry division was the latter's armored reconnaissance battalion, which was roughly triple the size of the mechanized cavalry recon troop in the U.S. division. The M8 were issued to the ten Free French armored recon battalions (one per infantry division, one per DB, and two non-divisional), as were at least some of the M3A1 and probably the M20.</p>
<p>† Each Free French M3A1 scout car's at-start HS or crew Passenger (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#39" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 39</a>) is a 2-4-8 or 2-2-8 respectively.</p>
<p>† Contrary to <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#z" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note Z</a>, the BAZ carried aboard the Free French M20 scout car is always a BAZ 44(a) (<a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="44"></a><span class="f_Strong">44. Marmon-Herrington III ME &amp; IIIv Armoured Cars:</span> In the fall of 1942 the 1st RMSM (Regiment de Marche de Spahis Marocains) became an armoured car unit. 21 Marmon-Herrington III (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#48" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 48</a>) formed the bulk of its vehicles, with three per platoon and four platoons per squadron. Some mounted non-standard ordnance (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#49" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 49</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="45"></a><span class="f_Strong">45. Humber Armoured Car:</span> A total of three Humber armoured cars (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#50" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 50</a>) were listed as being used in the 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the 1st RMSM in January 1943.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="46"></a><span class="f_Strong">46. M7 HMC &amp; M8 HMC:</span> Excluding those shipped to the British, 179 M7 HMC (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#44" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 44</a>) were Lend-Leased. It is quite possible that all were sent to the Free French, who used them in the armored artillery battalions of their three DB. (As per the U.S. table of organization, each such division would have required 54 M7.) M8 HMC (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#43" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 43</a>) were used in Free French tank, armored infantry and armored recon battalions.</p>
<p>To fully equip these units would have required about 140 M8.</p>
<p><a id="47"></a><img src="frenv085.jpg" width="336" height="228" alt="FrenV085" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">47. U.S. Halftracks:</span> The Free French received &gt; 1,400 U.S. halftracks, most of which were of the M5 and M9 types built by the International Harvester Co. solely for Lend-Lease purposes. They were employed by the Free French in the same way as U.S. forces used them; e.g., each DB contained three armored infantry battalions fully equipped with halftracks (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#29" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes 29</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#30" class="topiclink">30</a>). Fifty-four M21 MC and eight T30 HMC (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#33" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes 33</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#35" class="topiclink">35</a>) were used, the latter by one of the armored recon battalions. The M4A1 MC (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#32" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 32</a>) were apparently in-theater transfers to cover losses of M21. Some M3 GMC and T28E1 MGMC (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#34" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes 34</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#37" class="topiclink">37</a>) were turned over to the Free French in Tunisia, but evidently were used by them only for training.</p>
<p>† Regardless of the scenario date, each Free French M5A1 halftrack carries a BAZ 44(a) (<a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a>). Otherwise, this AFV is treated like the U.S. M3A1 halftrack [EXC: see <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a> for Scrounging/Removing its MG].</p>
<p>† The MG armament of the Free French M9 halftrack is treated like that of the M2 halftrack [EXC: see <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a> for Scrounging/Removing its MG].</p>
<p>† Each M5(MMG) and M5(HMG) halftrack's at-start Passenger squad (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#30" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 30</a>) is a 4-5-8 (or its two HS). Otherwise, these two AFV are treated like the U.S. M3(MMG) and M3(HMG) [EXC: see <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">F.9</a> for Scrounging/Removing their MG].</p>
<p>† Each M21/M4A1 MC halftrack starts the scenario with an Inherent infantry-crew (i.e., a 2-2-8) in lieu of a vehicle-crew.</p>
<p>† M5 RF is 1.3 for 1-7/44 and 1.0 thereafter. M5A1 RF is .2 &gt; that of the M5 for the corresponding Date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="48"></a><span class="f_Strong">48. Carriers:</span> Various types of Carriers (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#64" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Notes 64-65</a>) were used by the Free French—apparently excluding the mortar versions. The 1st BFL had 63 Carriers at Bir Hakeim in May 1942; each of its infantry battalions contained 14-18 (normally in five-vehicle sections), each of which mounted a French MG or 25mm anti-tank gun.</p>
<p>fEach Free French Carrier [EXC: the Carrier AC(b); see French Vehicle Note 31] begins the scenario containing an Inherent 2-4-8 HS. In a scenario set prior to 5/43, any MG Scrounged/Removed from a Free French Carrier (or its wreck) takes counter form as a British-color MG(f) of the same FP that it had as an Inherent MG.</p>
<p>† Decrease Carrier A, B and C initial RF by .2 for use in/after 5/42. Carrier, MMG A RF is 1.2 for 3-6/42, 1.3 for 7/42-5/43, and 1.4 for 6-11/43.</p>

<p><a id="49"></a><span class="f_Strong">49. &nbsp;Quad FAT:</span> Forty or more of these prime movers (<a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#80" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 80</a>) were issued to the Free French for the transport of 25pdr field pieces.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="50"></a><span class="f_Strong">50. &nbsp;British Jeeps &amp; Trucks:</span> The British provided a number of different types of transport vehicles to Free French units, which in the North African desert were completely motorized.</p>

U.S. Jeeps &amp; Trucks:</span> The Free French were Lend-Leased 15,880 transport vehicles of ≤ one ton, 4,402 of 1½-2 tons, 5,806 2½-tonners, and 1,088 of &gt; 2½ tons. Despite these numbers, there were periodic complaints of shortages—especially in regard to Jeeps (the GPA amphibious version often being substituted in Italy), and trucks of 1½-and 2½-ton capacity.</p>
