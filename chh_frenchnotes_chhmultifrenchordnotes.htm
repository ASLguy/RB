<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> This weapon may be Animal-Packed (<a href="chg_chg10.htm" class="topiclink">G10</a>).</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B.</span> A British-color version of this counter is provided, for use in Free French OBs as per <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.8a" class="topiclink">F.8A-.8C</a>, either in CROIX DE GUERRE (if so illustrated in its Ordnance Note) or WEST OF ALAMEIN.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C.</span> As signified by &quot;crew&quot; on the counter, this weapon requires a friendly crew in order to be used without the applicable penalties of <a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.11" class="topiclink">A21.11-.13</a>. Its BPV includes a crew as per <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">H1.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D.</span> Use one of the British-color dm 81mm MTR counters provided in CROIX DE GUERRE to represent a dismantled Free French 81mm MTR.</p>
<p><a id="e"></a><span class="f_Strong">E.</span> Availability is limited to use in Europe [EXC: Norway].</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.</span> Dates of availability are 5-6/40. Note E above also applies.</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G.</span> &quot;B⑪<span class="f_Exponent">40</span>&quot; on the counter signifies that this Gun suffers from Low Ammo (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">D3.71</a>) in scenarios set in 1940. This status can be negated only by SSR, an Ammo Vehicle (<a href="che_che10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">E10.1</a>) or an Ammo Dump (<a href="che_che10.htm#10.6" class="topiclink">E10.6</a>). For later scenarios it is assumed to have normal B12, and a BPV 10% (FRU) &gt; its printed BPV.</p>
<p><a id="p"></a><span class="f_Strong">P.</span> This Gun may be carried en portee, which means it may be loaded onto a vehicle (during setup/play) and carried as Passenger PP [EXC: porteeing a 47L AT or 75 ART is NA in scenarios set prior to 1941], The 25LL AT may be porteed by a C-K P17, Laffly S20TL or Citroen 23; any other Gun must use a Renault AGR2. Prior to setup, the vehicle must be noted on a side record as being able to portee a Gun of that particular Caliber Size (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">C2.21</a>) and Barrel Length (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">C4.1</a>). As a Passenger, the Gun and its ammo together use all but 5PP of the vehicle's Passenger capacity (note that this allows a C-K P17 to carry both a 25.LL AT and its crew despite the vehicle's total Passenger capacity of only 5PP).</p>
<p>The principles of (un)loading a Gun to/from portee status are the same as for the 2pdr Portee in <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#77" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 77</a>, except that here the Gun crew (un)loads as a Passenger rather than as an Inherent Crew, and a QSU Gun is not (un)loaded limbered. When a Gun has been thusly loaded, it is marked with an En Portee counter. A vehicle porteeing a Gun is not flipped over to its Wreck side if it becomes Immobilized, and the Gun may be unloaded (at which time the vehicle counter is then flipped over). If a vehicle porteeing a Gun is eliminated, the Gun is eliminated too. A vehicle may not simultaneously have one Gun en portee and another hooked up for towing. An AT (with a gunshield) being porteed can provide gunshield benefits to its Passenger crew in the same way the 2pdr Portee MA does to its Inherent crew. In a DYO scenario, the French player may purchase the correct portee vehicle in lieu of buying a normal towing vehicle as per <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.441" class="topiclink">1.441</a>.</p>
<p>Only the 25LL AT and 75 ART may be fired by its Passenger crew while being porteed [EXC: it may not use Bounding (First) Fire]. While loaded on the vehicle, its CA must coincide with its portee's VCA or &quot;rear&quot; VCA [EXC: &quot;rear&quot; VCA of the C-K P17 is NA] and may not change relative to that VCA.</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> No Gun counter—regardless of nationality—may use Motion Fire while being carried en portee.</p>
<p><a id="v"></a><span class="f_Strong">V.</span> Vichy French may use even the British-color version of this weapon without Captured penalties.</p>
<p><a id="w"></a><span class="f_Strong">W.</span> Provided in WEST OF ALAMEIN.</p>
<p><a id="y"></a><span class="f_Strong">Y.</span> Provided in YANKS.</p>
