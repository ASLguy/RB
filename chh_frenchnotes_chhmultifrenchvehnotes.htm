<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> The CMG may be repositioned as a 2-FP AAMG. This can be done only by placing an AA counter on the AFV at the end of any friendly fire phase (not MPh) in which its Inherent crew is CE and could have fired the MG (even if malfunctioned) but did not. This AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within the AFV's TCA—as signified by &quot;AAMG: TCA only&quot; on the counter. The AAMG may be repositioned as the CMG by using these same principles to remove the AA counter.</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> Any functioning CMG that may be repositioned as an AAMG may be Scrounged, regardless of the vehicle's/wreck's nationality.</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B.</span> The BMG receives an extra +1 DRM when firing at a moving/Motion target—as signified by a white dot behind the BMG factor on the counter.</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> Scrounging such a Fixed-Mount (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.81" class="topiclink">D1.81</a>) BMG is NA, regardless of the vehicle's/wreck's nationality.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C.</span> The CE DRM is +1 vs Indirect Fire, as well as vs Direct Fire that emanates from within the turret's rear Target Facing—as signified by &quot;CE: +1 RT&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D.</span> Reverse movement costs this vehicle twice its normal hex-entry cost—as signified by &quot;REVx2&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="e"></a><span class="f_Strong">E.</span> Availability is limited to use in Europe [EXC: Norway], regardless of whether the counter is French, British or U.S. color.</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.</span> &nbsp;If this counter is illustrated in the British or U.S. color in its Vehicle Note, it may be used in a Free French OB as per <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.8a" class="topiclink">F.8A-.8C</a>. The following apply regardless of this counter's nationality color(s), except as stated otherwise:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;&quot;(a)&quot;, &quot;(b)&quot; or &quot;(f)&quot; in the piece name stands for &quot;American&quot;, &quot;British&quot; or &quot;French&quot; respectively, for ESB (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">D2.5</a>), Hammada Immobilization (<a href="chf_chf3.htm#3.31" class="topiclink">F3.31</a>), Sand Bog (<a href="chf_chf7.htm#7.31" class="topiclink">F7.31</a>), etc., purposes;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;&quot;(a)&quot; or &quot;(b)&quot; also indicates that the MA uses black TH numbers (unless captured), as signified by &quot;Black TH#s&quot; on the counter;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;&quot;(a)&quot; also indicates that this vehicle is treated as Captured if crewed by other than Free French or U.S. [EXC: by other than Vichy French, for the French-color version of the AM Dodge(a)];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;&quot;(b)&quot; also indicates that this vehicle is treated as Captured if crewed by other than Vichy French or British (including Free French, etc.; <a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.4" class="topiclink">A25.4</a>);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;&quot;(f)&quot; also indicates that the MA always uses red TH numbers if this vehicle is an AFV, that a MG Scrounged from this vehicle (or its wreck) takes counter form as a British-color LMG(f) (with Captured-use penalties unless being fired by Free/Vichy French; <a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.8a" class="topiclink">F.8A</a>), and that this vehicle is treated as Captured if crewed by other than Free/Vichy French (<a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.8c" class="topiclink">F.8C</a>).</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G.</span> If armed, this vehicle has an Inherent crew and thus a CS# instead of a cs#.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><span class="f_Strong">H.</span> Prior to setup, and in addition to the normal <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.9" class="topiclink">A2.9</a> 10% Deployment allowance, the French player may freely Deploy a number of squads sufficient to provide one Passenger HS for each C-K P19, and two Passenger HS for each Lorraine 38L, in his OB—excluding each such vehicle that will set up towing-a-Gun/carrying-a-crew. These HS may Recombine (and the resulting squads may Deploy) as if they were Carrier HS and these vehicles were Carriers (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.82" class="topiclink">D6.82</a>).</p>
<p><a id="i"></a><span class="f_Strong">I.</span> Before any type of Immobilization result due to an attack [EXC: one caused by mines, or by a Direct Fire hit vs the front or rear Target Facing] takes effect vs this AFV, a subsequent dr must be made. If this dr is ≤ 4, Immobilization occurs; if ≥ 5, it does not. This is signified on the counter by &quot;Immob: dr ≤ 4&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="j"></a><span class="f_Strong">J.</span> This vehicle is treated as an armored car for movement (and all related) purposes [EXC: it may not cross a hedge; Reverse movement costs three times its normal hex-entry cost, as signified by &quot;REVx3&quot; on the counter].</p>
<p><a id="k"></a><span class="f_Strong">K. </span>This AFV may retain any unpossessed SW aboard it.</p>
<p><a id="l"></a><span class="f_Strong">L.</span> Ammunition of ≥ 100mm being carried by this vehicle (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a>) reduces its Passenger capacity by 4 (not 8) PP—as signified by &quot;Ammo: 4PP&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="m"></a><span class="f_Strong">M.</span> The MA may use neither Bounding First nor Motion Fire—as signified by &quot;No Bnd FF&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="r"></a><span class="f_Strong">R.</span> This AFV was equipped with a radio that could send/receive only morse code. It is therefore treated as a radioless AFV, but is assumed to have a morale of &quot;9&quot; for movement NTC (<a href="chd_chd14.htm#14.23" class="topiclink">D14.23</a>) purposes—as signified by &quot;®9&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="u"></a><span class="f_Strong">U.</span> Provided in CROIX DE GUERRE. Since it is U.S.-built, this vehicle does not suffer Captured penalties if manned by any U.S. Inherent SMC/MMC/Driver.</p>
<p><a id="w"></a><span class="f_Strong">W.</span> Provided in WEST OF ALAMEIN.</p>
<p><a id="y"></a><span class="f_Strong">Y</span>. Provided in YANKS.</p>
<p><a id="aa"></a><span class="f_Strong">AA.</span> The MA has AA capability—as signified by &quot;MA: AA&quot; on the counter.</p>
