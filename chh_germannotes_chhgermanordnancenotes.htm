It was rather complex for such a small weapon and, being little more than a glorified grenade launcher (like all such small caliber mortars) with insufficient range and punch, it was mostly relegated to second-line and reserve units after 1942. Its nickname was the Bulettenschmeister (meatball thrower). See also <a href="chh_germannotes_chhmultigermordnotes.htm#n" class="topiclink">German Ordnance note N</a></p>

It was the standard battalion support weapon, with six being issued to the machinegun company of each; these in turn were often distributed two per company within the battalion. In a foot-infantry unit the mortar was hand-carried when in action, but for long moves was carried in a horsecart. One interesting type of ammunition fired by the GrW 34 was the &quot;bouncing bomb&quot;, which rebounded into the air when it struck the ground; then at a height of 15-50 feet it exploded with an enhanced fragmentation effect. This round usually worked well if it struck hard ground but functioned poorly (if at all) when the ground was soft, so in 1942-43 it was withdrawn. Later in the war the GrW 34 was supplemented by a lightened, shorter-range version called the kz GrW 42. This variant had been intended for use in airborne units but eventually saw more general issue, often being used in infantry companies.</p>

A platoon of four GrW 42 was often found in the 4th (machinegun/Heavy Weapons) company of the infantry/Panzergrenadier battalion.</p>

The round had a 2.8cm caliber in the breech but, due to malleable skirts around the projectile (which were squeezed back by the tapered bore), the emerging projectile had only a 2cm caliber. The advantage of this design was that as the base area of the projectile decreased, the propellant exerted a proportionally increased pressure on it, thereby greatly increasing its muzzle velocity. The drawbacks were rapid bore wear and the need for large amounts of scarce tungsten. The projectile required a tungsten carbide core since, with a muzzle velocity of some 4600 ft/sec, a normal steel AP round would simply shatter upon impact. In 1942 however, the general shortage of tungsten necessitated a ban on its use in AT rounds, and as the ammunition supply dwindled the taper-bore guns fell into disuse. The sPzB 41 was built in only limited numbers, and was most commonly encountered in North Africa. There was also an airborne version that was issued later in 1941. This gun may be porteed by an Opel truck.</p>

By 1941 over 15,000 had been produced. It first saw combat during the Spanish Civil War in 1936, where it acquired a good reputation. In the 1940 invasion of France however, the PaK 35/36 was unable to penetrate the armor of certain French and British tanks, and the same proved true in Russia in 1941 when confronted by the T-34 or KV. Such increasingly inadequate performance caused the PaK 35/36 to become derisively referred to as the &quot;Army's door-knocker&quot;, and by 1942 most AT battalions were re-equipped with the new PaK 38. In the meantime a special HEAT projectile (the Stielgranate 41) was developed for the PaK 35/36, thus prolonging its usefulness even after it was relegated to second-line and reserve units. Prior to 1943, three platoons of four AT guns each made up the AT company of each infantry regiment, with another three companies in the divisional AT battalion. This gun may be porteed by an Opel truck.

Its nominal caliber was 4.03cm but its emergent caliber was 2.94cm. The lePaK 41 was issued in late 1941 to infantry and parachute troops, seeing action in Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, and Russia before its ammunition production was halted.

Unfortunately for them, however, the armor on many of the tanks this new gun would have to face was thicker than had been anticipated. Thus the PaK 38 could deal satisfactorily with the Matilda, T-34, or KV only when using scarce APCR rounds. In every other way, though, it was an excellent gun, being relatively small and easy to manhandle, and incorporated several innovative design features. It was initially issued primarily to anti-tank battalions, but as the heavier 7.5-7.62cm AT guns became available they displaced the PaK 38s—which in turn were allotted to the regimental AT companies (superseding the obsolete PaK 35/36). When production of APCR was halted in 1942, a temporary exemption was granted for the PaK 38 in order to prolong its usefulness. In 1943 the number of towed AT guns per platoon was lowered from four to three.  <a href="chh_germannotes_chhmultigermordnotes.htm#n" class="topiclink">See also German Ordnance note N</a></p>

It consisted of the barrel from the famous French 75 Model 1897, modified and mounted on a PaK 38 carriage. The gun was too powerful for this light carriage however, which caused problems in action. Some 700 were built and rushed to the Eastern front, but as soon as better guns became available the PaK 97/38 was relegated to second-line use. Some were encountered in Normandy, being used as light artillery. Captured French and Polish ammunition was mostly used with the PaK 97/38, but a HEAT round was also specially designed and issued for it.

In fact, the PaK 40 was really a scaled-up version of the PaK 38 and looked very similar to it (except for being larger, of course). Design work on the PaK 40 began in 1939, but Operation Barbarossa and the discovery of the T-34 and KV found it still in the pre-production stage. Once its manufacture began however, it did not cease until 1945. In action the PaK 40 was an excellent AT gun—its only drawback being its weight, which made it difficult to manhandle. The PaK 40 eventually became the standard equipment of AT battalions; it was mounted on many TD and was also the basis of the long-barreled 7.5cm gun used in the PzKpfw IV and StuG III. Some were even issued as field guns although in this mode they were hindered by their limited elevation.</p>

A substantial number were adapted to use German-designed ammunition and firing techniques, and in this guise became an excellent (and low cost) addition to the German anti-tank armory. The modified versions were not available until 1942, but the piece Date reflects their earlier use. 124 were received by the Afrika Korps; availability in North Africa begins as of 1942.</p>

It was easy to conceal, very hard-hitting, able to fire while limbered, traversable through 360°, and accurate at extremely long range. Variants of this excellent gun were mounted in the Tiger II, Nashorn, Jagdpanther, and Ferdinand. The game piece can also be used to represent the FlaK 41 AA/AT gun, which first saw service in Tunisia in 1943 (RF 1.5); however, when used as the FlaK 41 the piece should have B10 in both limbered and unlimbered modes.

The result was big and awkward (it was nicknamed Scheuntor [barndoor]), but in action was just as powerful as the PaK 43. It was encountered by the Allies on all fronts.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><img src="germo030.jpg" width="172" height="75" alt="GermO030" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">14. 12.8cm K81/1:</span> Several different prototypes of a 12.8cm gun configured like the PaK 43 were built, but none ever reached production. In order to utilize the existing barrels, a small number (about 50) were mounted on captured French 155mm and Soviet 152mm carriages and issued as AT/field guns.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><img src="germo032.jpg" width="176" height="74" alt="GermO032" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">15. &nbsp;7.5cm leIG 18:</span> The standard regimental light support piece of the German infantry. Its design was initiated in 1927 and, once production started, it remained in use throughout the war. A special lightened version was also provided for mountain troops. Six were allocated to the 13th (infantry gun) company of each infantry regiment. One interesting feature of this howitzer was its breech action, which was similar to that of a shotgun; i.e., the barrel was pivoted, and reloading was accomplished by elevating the rear of the barrel to clear the non-moving breech block. The short-barrelled 7.5cm guns mounted in German AFV were not derived from the leIG 18, incidentally. Several other light infantry guns were built and issued during the war (e.g., the IG 37 and IG 42) but do not differ in game terms.

It was also the heaviest and largest-caliber infantry gun used during the war. In action its 84 lb. HE shell provided powerful support, but its weight greatly limited its tactical mobility and led to a number of SP variants on fully-tracked chassis.

They were not as popular with the users however, who disliked the dangers and tactical limitations inherent in their tremendous backblast. The LG 40 was the first recoilless gun to see combat in the ground role, being initially used during the airborne assault on Crete. Some 450 were built, and were issued to parachute and mountain regiments, and probably also to Jaeger (light infantry). Two RCL were often present in the MG company of each such regiment. Errata: The counter should have a thin white circle representing a T Gun type. See also <a href="chh_germannotes_chhmultigermordnotes.htm#n" class="topiclink">German Ordnance note N</a></p>

This resulted in the 10.5cm LG 42 (and the similar 10.5cm LG 40), which was used in the same manner as the earlier 7.5cm gun. Recoilless guns could be either dropped by parachute or landed with their SdKfz 2 Kettenkrad towing vehicles in a glider. Production of German recoilless guns ceased in early 1944 since they consumed three to five times the amount of propellant used in conventional artillery—and by this time in the war propellant was in short supply. 10.5cm LG 42 were sometimes used as artillery in divisions of the types mentioned in the preceding Note.</p>
<p>†Sources vary on when this gun became available. Some say late 1941 while others state 1943. The earlier date may represent combat trials; therefore, RF is 1.5 prior to 1943. <span class="f_Highlight">Errata:</span> The counter should have a thin white circle representing a T Gun type.

Some were used as first-line artillery pieces in the early campaigns, but in 1941 most were passed to reserve and occupation units. The game piece also represents the later FK 18, as well as many other similar types captured during the early Blitzkrieg years. Volksgrenadier divisions often contained at least one battalion of 7.5cm artillery.</p>

It was a good reliable piece, but was generally heavier and shorter-ranged than its Allied equivalents. Subsequent versions attempted to redress these problems but were never entirely successful. Some leFH 18 were also used by Hungary. German towed artillery batteries usually consisted of four guns each, although in 1944-45 some only had three guns while batteries in Panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions might have six. A version of the leFH 18 was mounted in the Wespe SPA.</p>

They were also used as corps artillery.</p>

Like most of the German artillery park, it was somewhat large, heavy, and short-ranged for its caliber. Its actual maximum range in hexes was 333—but is given in the Listing as 243, which was its normally allowed maximum range. Increasing the range further (by adding extra propellant charges) required permission from a higher formation, due to the strain such use imposed on the gun: therefore its true maximum range could be utilized only under exceptional circumstances. A later version (the sFH 18M) reduced the wear/stress problem, and another variant (the sFH 18/40) increased the range to 377, but this latter model was much less accurate and only 46 were built. The sFH 18 was used in batteries of four or six guns, and was also mounted on the Hummel SPA. The sFH 18 was also used by Finland and Italy.

It had a rather low rate of fire and a tendency for the feed mechanism to jam; nevertheless, it remained in use throughout the war. It was also used as the main armament in the early PzKpfw II and armored cars.</p>

It was also used in a variety of reconnaissance vehicles. Use of the single-barreled 2cm FlaK gun in the AA role began to diminish in early 1944 due to its decreasing ability to deal with the faster and more heavily armored Allied ground attack aircraft. In March 1944 there were 19,692 FlaK 30 and 38 guns in service with the Luftwaffe, while an undetermined number were being used by the Army.

Its prodigious firepower was feared by Allied pilots, and could be quite deadly against ground targets. In January 1945 there were 3,806 in service with the Luftwaffe, and in the last few months of the war a FlaKvierling with on-carriage radar was used in radar-controlled AA-fire experiments. 2cm FlaK platoons could consist of either three or four guns each.</p>

In its towed version it does not seem to have often been included in the Army's divisional establishments. Apparently most were used in FlaK divisions and independent FlaK regiments and battalions. A 3.7cm FlaK platoon consisted of three guns, with three platoons forming a battery. The main difference between the FlaK 36 and 37 was in the type of sights used.

It featured a substantially increased rate of fire, but was also much bulkier than the older guns. Relatively few were made; there were 1032 in service with the Luftwaffe in February 1945.</p>

It was an excellent design and quickly became the mainstay of the Luftwaffe heavy AA defenses. The differences between the Flak 18 and 36 were minor; many of their parts were interchangeable. During the Spanish Civil War its usefulness against ground targets was noted, and appropriate ammunition was developed for this role. The 88's lasting fame (or notoriety) came with its use in North Africa, where it easily destroyed the previously invulnerable Matildas at over 2000m. It came to be so feared in the desert that British crewmen were said to sometimes abandon their tank even if an 88's first shot missed them—for they knew it rarely missed with a second. Nor did its reputation ever diminish. One reason for this was that at the end of the war an 88 could still frontally penetrate any U.S. or British tank, save perhaps the Sherman Jumbo. Another reason was that so many 88s were built; for instance, in August 1944 the Luftwaffe alone had 10,704 in service—and this number does not include those used in Army FlaK battalions. These facts alone make it easy to understand why they made such a powerful impression on those who had to face them. An 88 platoon consisted of four guns, usually towed by SdKfz 7.
