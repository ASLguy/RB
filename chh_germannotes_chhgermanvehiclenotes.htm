<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 1 1939, Germany possessed some 4,564 AFV, of which only 583 were armed with a 37 or 75mm gun; the vast majority of German AFVs of this period had only MG or 20mm armament. During the invasion of France the German Army fielded about 2,800 AFV against approximately 4,000 French and British; in the invasion of the Soviet Union some 3,350 Panzers were initially committed. These figures show just how effective the new Blitzkrieg tactics really were. Of course, the Blitzkrieg itself was successful due to the Germans' radical theories on, and greater experience with, combined arms warfare. Panzer divisions—the crucial element in Blitzkrieg—were entirely self-sufficient formations, an arrangement that provided greater flexibility and, in concert with sound training and bold aggressive leadership, led to successes out of all proportion to their numbers.</p>
<p>Individually, German AFV were generally characterized by their engineering sophistication—sometimes to the point of needless complexity. This sophistication together with insufficient standardization (which led to problems in mass production) made them time-consuming and expensive to build relative to the Allies' AFV. When they worked they performed extremely well but when broken-down were often difficult to repair. Moreover, the persistent shortage of AFV after the first few years necessitated their almost constant use, thus exacerbating wear and tear and increasing the likelihood of breakdowns. Still another problem was the proliferation of different AFV types—especially tank destroyers. To illustrate, there were no fewer than seventeen different types of tank destroyers having production figures of at least sixty vehicles and used in combat. Such variety must have been a nightmare to the supply and repair echelons.</p>
<p>For the first three years of what Hitler had envisioned as a short war, AFV production was kept at a relatively low level. By late 1942 however, it was seen that this policy was leading to disaster and so production was greatly increased, resulting in some 20,500 AFV being built in 1943 (3.5 times the number built in 1941). Of this figure though, more than one-third were simply armored halftracks. After being caught with inferior tanks in Russia, by 1943 the Germans had regained the initiative in new tank design but could never gain quantitative parity with the Allies. Germany's total World War 2 AFV production was approximately 80,000 vehicles (including the many command, observation, recovery, etc., versions), but of these only about 22,800 were the Panzer III-VI models. In contrast, the U.S. produced almost 50,000 of the Sherman alone. In the end, Germany's panzer divisions were swamped by a vast flood of Allied AFVs; no degree of tactical superiority could overcome such disparity in numbers. Any counter errata mentioned in the German/Russian Vehicle and Ordnance Notes applies only to the 1st edition counters of BEYOND VALOR/RED BARRICADES.</p>

Intended only as a training vehicle, it was nonetheless used in combat as early as 1936 in the Spanish Civil War. By June 1941 however, only 74 were still in use. About 1,500 Ausf (Ausfuehrung = Model) A and B were built. Five PzKpfw I made up a platoon.</p>

Nonetheless, it was used as a main battle tank in Poland, where 90% of the German tanks used were PzKpfw I and II. The Ausf A is representative of the various early types, of which some 1,200 were built. Five PzKpfw II comprised a full-strength platoon.</p>

The Date in the Armor Listing also includes earlier versions which were uparmored after the Polish campaign and are equivalent to the Ausf F in game terms. Because of its relatively weak armament, from 1940 the PzKpfw II was used primarily for reconnaissance, with one platoon officially allotted for this purpose to each Pz. company (deleted in 1942), Pz. battalion, and Pz. regiment (the latter two being deleted in late 1943).

Survivors were withdrawn in early 1942 for conversion to tank destroyers. Flammpanzer II platoons were attached to several Pz. regiments, while others were used in Flammpanzer companies or battalions attached at corps or army level.</p>

It was used on both Eastern and Western Fronts. The initial production order was for 800 vehicles but was cancelled after only 104 had been built, since the design was not cost-effective. This cancellation occurred in spite of the fact that the balance of the vehicles were to have been armed with the high velocity 5cm gun.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="germv014.jpg" width="173" height="75" alt="GermV014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. &nbsp;PzKpfw 35t:</span> 298 were built by the Czechs in 1936-39 as their main battle tank LT vz 35. Another 126 were exported to Rumania in 1936 where they were known as the R-2. When the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia they seized 219 LT vz 35s; the other 79 were kept by newly &quot;independent&quot; Slovakia. German use of the PzKpfw 35(t) was confined to the 6th Pz. Brigade of the 1st Light Division in Poland and later the 6th Pz. Division in France and Russia. Errata: The name on the counter should not have the &quot;t&quot; in parentheses, since German Vehicle Note E does not apply to this AFV.</p>

The PzKpfw 38(t) was used in Poland by the 1st and 3rd Light Divisions; in Norway; in France by the 7th and 8th Pz. Divisions; and in the Balkans campaign by the 8th Pz. Division. In Russia it was used by the 6th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 16th 19th 20th, and 22nd Pz. Divisions—and possibly others. In June 1941 more than one quarter of the total strength of the German Panzer units consisted of Czech tanks. 565 of the Ausf A-D and S were built.</p>

Aufklaerer 38(t):</span> This consisted of a late model 38(t) chassis combined with a PSW 234/1 turret—a stopgap design necessitated by the halting of PzKpfw IIL production. It was used in the Panzerspaehwagen Kompanie Type B (i.e., using the same organization as the PzKpfw IIL—although only one type was issued per company). Only 50 were built, but they saw action on both Eastern and Western fronts.

Many had their turrets removed and used to build the Atlantic Wall; others were given to security troops, training depots, or used for police duties. The FT-17 730 and 730m represent both the FT-17s and FT-18s which were put into use by the German Army. They were, for the most part, updated by adding a radio to the vehicle.</p>

Many were pressed into service, however, as battle tanks in secondary theaters. All the Hotchkiss variations used by the Germans had the commander's observation cupola replaced by a split hatch, and all were equipped with radio equipment. Predominantly issued to reforming units, their first use was in 1941 in Finland. Ten independent platoons were sent to the Balkans to fight partisans. Typically, four tanks were allocated to a platoon with the commander of a platoon issued a captured French S-35. As late as December of 1944, the German Army still had 29 38H 735s in service.</p>

Upon capturing several hundred of them, the German Army quickly issued them to various training units. With the horrific tank losses in Russia during 1941-42, the Germans were forced to strip AFVs from units in secondary theaters and replace them with the 35-S 739. The 35-S 739 was also used for anti-partisan operations. The Germans modified the SOMUA by altering the commander's cupola and by adding a radio to each vehicle. Typically, the 35-S 739 was used as the commander's vehicle in a platoon consisting off four 38H 735s and one 35-S 739. As late as December of 1944, the German Army still had 12 35-S 739s in service.

The game piece represents the various early models, with several different types of suspension, of which 90 were built. On September 1, 1939, a total of only 98 PzKpfw III were available to the Pz. divisions (some of which contained none at all during the Polish campaign).</p>
<p>†All the initial models were withdrawn from service 2/40 except for a few Ausf D that participated in the fighting in Norway, 4/40.</p>

PzKpfw IIIF:</span> This was the version accepted for mass production. The game piece and Date also represent the earlier Ausf E. 96 Ausf E and 435 Ausf F were built. In 1939-40, a full-strength PzKpfw III platoon consisted of three to five such AFVs, depending on the unit involved.</p>

About 550 of the Ausf G were built. In 1941 the official strength of a PzKpfw III platoon was increased to five vehicles. &nbsp;See also <a href="chh_germannotes_chhmultigermvehnotes.htm#n" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note N</a></p>

Equivalent to the Ausf H in game terms however, are 1,549 early Ausf J, plus many more converted from the earlier Ausf E and F by installing the 5cm gun and bolting on extra armor; in this sense the PzKpfw IIIH (and its equivalents) can be considered to have been the backbone of the Panzer force in 1941-42. For Operation Sea Lion (the proposed invasion of England) some PzKpfw III were modified so that they could travel under water. Some of these Tauchpanzer were used by the 18th Pz. Regiment on June 22, 1941, to cross the Bug River at Patulin.</p>

Even then, it did not begin to equip the PzKpfw III until the end of the year. In the desert this AFV came to be known to the British as the Mark III Special. 1067 were built. Beginning in early 1943, 262 PzKpfw III were converted into observation vehicles (termed Panzerbeobachtungswagen) for Panzer-artillerie batteries. Rules for their use are given in <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.46" class="topiclink">H1.46</a>.</p>

Prior to 6/43, ten were allotted to each Tiger Company. Others were used in the PzKpfw IV role, and yet others probably equipped the Pz. battalion included in each of the newly-renamed Pz. Grenadier divisions. A total of 700 were constructed.

PzKpfw III(Fl):</span> 100 were built, in consideration of experiences at Stalingrad. Each III(Fl) platoon had seven such AFV—usually two of which would be attached to a Pz. regiment HQ company when needed. First use was with the 6th, 11th, and Grossdeutschland Pz. Divisions during the battle of Kursk.</p>

PzKpfw IVA:</span> The PzKpfw IV was designed to be a support AFV, providing long range HE firepower. Foresight in design and reliability in use enabled it to be the only German tank to remain in production throughout the war— yet with only some 8,500 being built. The series had a modest beginning of only 35 Ausf A, which saw action in Poland, Norway, and France before being withdrawn. In 1939-40, a full-strength PzKpfw IV platoon had 4-6 such AFVs, varying from unit to unit. In 1939 each Pz. company contained only one PzKpfw IV platoon, except for the 1st Pz. Division which had a Medium Company (of 14 PzKpfw IV and 5 PzKpfw II) in its Pz. battalions, and the 1st Light Division which had eight PzKpfw IV per Pz. company.</p>

PzKpfw IVF2:</span> The 7.5cm KwK 40 L/43 version was ordered 11/41 as a countermeasure to the Russian T-34 and KV, whose appearance had instantly made the PzKpfw III—the fist of the Pz. division—obsolete since it could neither successfully trade blows with them nor be effectively up-gunned to do so. 200 were built, but the game piece also represents about 1,000 of the Ausf G, which is indistinguishable from the F2 in game terms. The British in North Africa referred to this tank as the Mark IV Special.</p>
<p>In 1943 the PzKpfw III was no longer capable of being considered a main battle tank in other than name. Consequently, in September of that year the Medium (PzKpfw IV) Company in each Pz. battalion was ordered dropped in favor of equipping all companies in one battalion with the PzKpfw IV, while the other battalion (presumably containing the PzKpfw III) was to be withdrawn to be re-equipped with the Panther. This took quite some time to fully accomplish.</p>

PzKpfw IVH:</span> With 3,774 produced, this was numerically the most important PzKpfw IV and formed the mainstay of the Pz. divisions during the latter years of the war. The Date and game piece also represent about 700 Ausf G which had extra armor bolted onto the hull and superstructure front (the Ausf H itself actually became available during the spring of 1943).</p>
<p>An interesting gunnery aid found on the PzKpfw IV, Panther D, and Tiger E, was a rotating ring around the inside circumference of the commander's cupola. This cupola was marked from 1 to 12 like a clock, with further subdivisions also indicated. When the turret was traversed, the ring rotated at the same speed but in the opposite direction, thus allowing the commander to tell at a glance the turret's position relative to the vehicle's axis (something easily forgotten in the heat of battle). In addition, he used it to quickly bring the gun to bear on a target; for this purpose the gunner had a clock scale indicator which he had only to align according to the bearing given by the commander and the target would appear in his gunsight.</p>
<p>A full-strength PzKpfw IV platoon was officially comprised of five such AFV, but the ever-present tank shortage in reality reduced this to four in all but certain favored Pz. divisions.</p>

Its hasty design and premature commitment to battle made for a most inauspicious debut in the Kursk offensive however; its drive train and suspension were overstrained, while its engine overheated easily and had a tendency to catch fire (all due to the Panther's combat weight exceeding its design specifications by about 8 tons). Indeed, many more were lost due to mechanical failure than were destroyed by Russian guns (116 of the available 192 Panther tanks alloted for the Kursk offensive were in need of repair just 7 days into the campaign). 842 were built. The only units to employ the Panther at Kursk were Panzerabteilungen 51 and 52, forming the 10th Pz. Brigade which was attached to Panzer Grenadier Division Grossdeutschland the morning the offensive began. Of the 184 Panther Ausf. D's fully operational on the morning of 5 July, 1943, (the beginning of Operation &quot;Zitadelle&quot;) only 44 would be running a mere 12 days later.

Its combination of firepower, mobility, and armor made it an extremely formidable opponent. The U.S. Army judged that it generally took five Shermans to destroy a Panther. Although over 5,000 were built (2,000 As and 3,126 Gs) and the 1944 Pz. Regiment establishment called for one battalion each of Panthers and PzKpfw IV (with the Panthers generally equipping the 1st battalion), there were—fortunately for the Allies—never enough to go around. Like the PzKpfw IV, the Panther—in other than favored Pz. divisions—was used in four-vehicle platoons rather than the five called for in the official establishment.</p>

PzKpfw VIE: </span>The Tiger is probably the most legendary AFV of World War II. At the time of its introduction, its &quot;88&quot; gun— used in a tank for the first time—combined with its heavy armor, made it a most deadly adversary. Indeed, at that time it could rarely be knocked out except by a close-range flank or rear shot—although its great weight, lack of mobility, and poor reliability (due to a very complicated drive train and suspension) diminished its overall effectiveness. Tigers were used in independent heavy (&quot;schwere&quot;) tank companies and battalions allotted as strategic reserves; although the Grossdeutschland had an organic Tiger company (7/43-8/43, and thereafter an entire battalion), as did the SS Leibstandarte, SS Das Reich, and SS Totenkopf divisions (1/43-3/44, 2/43-3/44, 7/43-3/44 respectively). A full-strength Tiger platoon consisted of four such AFV.</p>

Its use in the Ardennes offensive was not impressive; its ponderousness impeded the speed of advance across the hilly countryside, and even a minor breakdown could cause its loss through the inability of the recovery vehicles to tow it. 489 were built.

As Germany was driven more and more to a defensive stance, assault gun production was increased, as such AFV were both cheaper and quicker to produce than turreted tanks, and their lower height was advantageous in the ambush role. They were used in both assault gun and TD units. About 8,600 were produced, including 614 of the earlier Ausf F and F/8, which the game piece also represents. Another 1,100 were built on PzKpfw IV chassis but do not differ in game terms. One battery (six vehicles) was sent to Tunisia in late 1942 (RF 1.6).</p>

Sturmtiger:</span> This vehicle, known as the Sturmmorser (assault mortar) Sturmtiger or Tiger-Morser, owed its existence to Hitler's requirement of August 1943 that the 38cm naval antisubmarine rocket launcher Gertit 652 be mounted on the Tiger I chassis. The idea was to create a more potent version of the Sturmpanzer IV, which had just entered service. The huge mortar required a special crane fitted on the vehicle roof for loading the rounds that weighed 726 lbs. each; only 13-14 were carried. A special shape-charged round was available for use against fortifications. Some sources indicate that as few as ten vehicles were completed, with another eight under various states of completion when the war ended. Others state that sixteen to eighteen were completed between August and December 1944. Two were used in the Warsaw Uprising during August 1944, but most entered service long after the need for siege vehicles had ended. They were formed into Panzer Sturmmorser Kompanien (PzStuMrKp) 1000, 1001, and 1002 and used for the final defense of the Reich. The first two units had about seven vehicles between them. These units went into action west of the Rhine in March 1945 against U.S. and British troops, later retreating across the river into the Ruhr area.</p>

Their thick armor allowed them to drive deep into the Russian defenses where, without infantry support and lacking MGs, they were overwhelmed by Russian tank-hunter teams using FT and DC. 39 were lost during the Kursk fighting, and the remainder fought on for the rest of the year, finally being pulled out from the Nikopol area in late 1943. 48 were then modified by the addition of a BMG and a redesigned superstructure roof.

Marder I(f):</span> Marders were stopgap mobile AT guns necessitated by the Russian T-34 and KV. They consisted of a captured Russian 7.62cm field gun (or later when available the 7.5cm PaK 40) hurriedly mounted on an obsolete tank chassis and given a rudimentary shield for crew protection. Their weak armor rendered them ineffective in other than ambush and long range situations. They were issued mainly to Panzerjaeger (tank-hunter or TD) detachments. The Marder I was a conversion of the French Lorraine Schlepper (Tractor). 170 were converted, of which 131 were still on the Western Front at the beginning of 1944.</p>

Armed with the excellent PaK 40/L46, this Geschutzwagen was a lethal vehicle in an ambush role, but lacked the armor to duel with Allied AFVs. 24 vehicles were converted in 1942 and were still in service in France during the Normandy invasion.</p>

One SOMUA MCG variant was the panzerjager conversion. By mounting a 7.5 cm PaK 40 to the bed of the halftrack, a crude tank destroyer was formed. The driver of the conversion sat in front of the gunshield of the PaK, which was mounted to the rear of the halftrack.

This vehicle mounted 16 captured French 81mm Brandt mortars in two rows in the rear of the halftrack upon a hand-crankable turret providing 360-degree traverse. The 16 barrels were arranged so that they were elevated together. The outer three tubes could be turned outward a few more degrees to provide even greater coverage. A mechanism was created which held the mortar shells in the tubes, and by pulling a lanyard would release the bombs. The shells were not fired simultaneously, but rather in a rapid succession, thus simulating a barrage of mortar fire. Only 90 rounds were carried by the vehicle, and reload time was rather significant. Because of the dispersed nature of its attack, hits are resolved in the target hex at 6 FP (instead of the normal 8 FP). Besides the attack on the target hex, the two adjacent hexes (called the secondary hexes) in the (alternate) hexgrain perpendicular to the LOF are also attacked with the same DR, but at only 4 FP and only if there is an enemy unit in the target hex. If the LOF enters the target hex directly along a hexspine, then the two adjacent hexes directly perpendicular to the LOF are the secondary hexes. Otherwise the two secondary hexes are chosen randomly. If the Original colored dr of the TH DR is even, the secondary hexes are the two hexes adjacent to both the target hex and to the hex that the LOF exits when entering the target hex. If the colored dr is odd, the secondary hexes are the two hexes adjacent to both the target hex and to the hex the LOF enters upon exiting the target hex. The hex affected by any CH is selected randomly, and is attacked at 16 FP. This counter is found in HASL Module 4 Pegasus Bridge.</p>

Furthermore, the turret represents the 360-degree traverse of the mortars, and only the mounting for the mortars rotated when the turret was traversed. The CE DRM is +1 vs Indirect Fire, as well as vs Direct Fire that emanates from within the rear VCA. All hits use the VCA facing, regardless of which way the TCA is pointing. All Direct Fire hits that emanate from within the rear VCA (and only such hits) qualify for the rear Target Facing TK DRM.</p>
<p>†When full strength Smoke is placed in the target hex, dispersed Smoke is also placed in the secondary hexes. When firing Smoke, Case K applies if there are no Known enemy units in the target hex and there are non-Known (to the vehicle) enemy units in any of the potential secondary hexes.

<p>EX: Halftrack A attacks target hex W7 with 6 FP and secondary hexes X6 and V7 with 4 FP. Halftrack B attacks target hex V2 with 6 FP. The secondary hexes it attacks with 4 FP are chosen randomly; if the Original colored dr of the TH DR is even, hexes U3 and W3 are attacked; if the colored dr is odd, hexes U2 and W2 are attacked. The exposed crew of either halftrack attacked by the inherent FP of squad C receives a +1 CE DRM because the attack emanates from the rear VCA. Similarly, a PIAT hit by squad C against either halftrack would receive the +1 Case A increase to its Basic TK# due to a rear hit, even if halfrack B were hit in the turret. All attacks by squad D against either halftracks receive the normal +2 CE DRM, and the Basic TK# of a PIAT hit by squad D versus the turret of halftrack B would not be increased by Case A.</p>

The &quot;Moving&quot; side has the higher MP allotment, but cannot fire at any target at the same level as or at a lower level than itself. The &quot;Firing&quot; side permits the MA to fire at all targets normally.

<p>†While in &quot;Firing&quot; mode, the crew is always completely exposed to FP from all directions (as is the MA) with no CE DRM, and Random SW Destruction applies to the MA; however, the AFV is not considered to be an unarmored target via its superstructure.

Depending on the model, it carried 132-165 lbs. of high explosive (a rare late model carried 220 lbs.) and was used primarily by special Pioneer units for the destruction of strongpoints and the clearance of minefields. Initially its use met with success—but as Allied troops came to recognize it and learned of its vulnerability to even small arms fire, they were more often than not able to destroy it long before it could reach its target. 7,600 of all models were built.

<p>A Goliath, since its M# is 11, can be towed by any vehicle having a T# of ≤ 11; to be (un)hooked it must be (un)limbered as if a non-QSU Gun. A Goliath can also, when unlimbered, move under its own power via remote control; the controller can only be its unpinned, Good Order, purchase-associated HS (the Goliath's BPV includes the purchase of a 3-3-8 HS). Control/detonation of a Goliath is considered use of a SW. Remote control itself does not cause loss of concealment/HIP, but if the controller becomes pinned/broken/BU the Goliath must immediately stop and cannot be detonated until the controller is free of this condition (if the controller becomes berserk/captured/eliminated the Goliath is immediately eliminated). To be remotely controlled the Goliath must start its MPh in the LOS of its controller and is treated as a fully-tracked BU <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> AFV for movement purposes [EXC: it does not pay MP for VCA change; it is immediately eliminated if it enters a non-dry stream; it can enter a wire/rubble hex or cross a wall/road-block/hedge/bocage hexside but is immobilized (though not eliminated) when it does so; it cannot carry any PRC/PP or make an OVR]. The Goliath has a range of 16 hexes; i.e., it may not be farther than 16 hexes from its controller while unlimbered. If for any reason the range becomes greater than this (e.g., if the controller breaks and routs away), the Goliath is immediately eliminated. When a Goliath enters a hex to which the LOS from its controller is Hindered, it must undergo a Bog DR using all applicable modifiers. A bogged Goliath is treated like any other bogged vehicle. If the Goliath moves out of its controller's LOS it must likewise undergo a Bog DR: in this case however, if the Bog DR is failed the Goliath is immediately eliminated; if it passes (and has MP remaining) it can continue to move, but if the next hex it enters is also not in the controller's LOS it is immediately eliminated. A controller cannot move in the same MPh as his Goliath moves, nor vice versa; he can, however, advance in the same Player Turn in which his Goliath moves.</p>
<p>A Goliath attacks (and may attack the same targets) as a Placed DC, but with 36 FP. A Goliath can be detonated (i.e., attack) in a friendly AFPh—but only if its controller can use a SW and is unpinned, non-BU, in Good Order, and has a LOS to both the Goliath and at least one enemy unit or bridge that can be affected by its attack. If a Goliath becomes a Burning Wreck or is detonated, it explodes in the same manner as a 36 FP Placed DC attack [EXC: the Goliath has X11, used as per <a href="cha_cha23.htm#23.4" class="topiclink">A23.4</a>] vs all unarmored units in its hex and a 16FP DC attack vs such units in each hex adjacent to it. The same effects DR is used to resolve all attacks. Placement is considered to be at the level occupied by the Goliath; treat as Successfully Positioned (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.346" class="topiclink">C7.346</a>) vs the weakest rear AF of each AFV in the Goliath's hex [EXC: if the designated target in the Goliath's hex is a single stopped AFV, the Goliath is treated as Optimally Positioned; <a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.346" class="topiclink">C7.346</a>], and as Poorly Positioned vs any AFV in the adjacent hexes (using the Target Facing the AFV presents to the Goliath's hex). An exploding Goliath can affect a Fortification counter (or minefield; use <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">B28.62</a>) only if in the same hex with it. Alternatively, a Goliath can be detonated at any time during another friendly fire phase, provided the above-mentioned controller conditions are met; such use incurs a +2 Effects DRM (regardless of whether or not the Goliath/target are moving/in Motion).</p>
<p>For defensive purposes a Goliath is always treated as an unarmored vehicle. CC vs a Goliath is always sequential; moreover, the Goliath can attack in the CCPh (in its sequential order) by its controller detonating it (the above-mentioned +2 DRM does not apply). A Goliath cannot be captured in CC. The Goliath counter is removed whenever it attacks or is destroyed—and if destroyed such that it would have become a burning wreck if it had wreck capability, it instead automatically detonates. A Goliath detonated by Defensive First Fire does not leave Residual FP.</p>
<p>For stacking purposes a Goliath is considered a SW (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.4" class="topiclink">A5.4</a>). When used in connection with the Goliath, the term &quot;immediately eliminated&quot; implies removal from play before any chance to detonate it. Errata: The counter should have three white stars on the Limbered side.</p>
