<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> &nbsp;MA and CMG (if so equipped) have AA capability—signified by &quot;MA:AA&quot; being printed on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B. </span>Optional AAMG is available 1944-45 with RF of 1.3.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C.</span> &nbsp;Subtract .1 from RF for each year after that listed as the vehicle's initial year of availability, until its final listed RF is reached.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D. </span> This vehicle is assumed to be towing an ammo trailer which, by its owner's announcement, can be unhooked at the start of its MPh if it is not in Motion and its crew is CE. Unhooking is accomplished by simply flipping the counter over to the side showing no trailer. Its MP allotment is thus increased (although the act of unhooking the trailer costs the vehicle one-fourth of this new MP allotment), and its B# becomes 11. [EXC: 10 for SdKfz 10/4]. The trailer is always assumed to be hooked up at the start of a scenario, and an unhooked trailer cannot be hooked up again. A hooked-up trailer is otherwise treated as per <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">C10.4-.41</a>.</p>
<p><a id="e"></a><span class="f_Strong">E. </span> As signified by the &quot;(t)&quot; in the piece name, this AFV used the extremely reliable and durable chassis of the PzKpfw 38(t); therefore, it receives a zero Nationality DRM when risking Excessive Speed Breakdown (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">D2.5</a>).</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.</span> The results of a Mechanical Reliability DR (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">D2.51</a>) for a Panther D are modified as follows. If a 12 is rolled, its engine has caught fire and the Panther is replaced by a burning wreck (the crew automatically survives, with a scrounged German LMG). If an 11 is rolled, Immobilization occurs normally as per <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">D2.51</a>. If a 10 is rolled, the Panther has stalled; its owner must then immediately make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to stop, but excluding the MP expended to start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It can again attempt to move, but must expend another MP to start—and must undergo another Mechanical Reliability DR as it does so. An AFV that stalls is subject to Defensive First Fire (since it has expended a MP to start), but not as a moving target unless it had already entered a new hex during the same MPh. Should a Stall result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, the AFV is considered to have expended its entire MP allotment in Delay.</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G. </span> Gunshield yields +3 DRM against incoming fire through vehicle's front Target Facing instead of the normal +2 DRM for CE status. This is shown on the counter by &quot;CE: +3&quot; on the reverse side. This Note does not apply to pre-1943 scenarios for the Marder IIIH.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><span class="f_Strong">H.</span> Each time a Panther G or Jagdpanther expends one MP to start, its owner must make a DR; if a 12 is rolled, the AFV has stalled and has not actually begun to move. The owner must then immediately make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to stop, but excluding the MP expended to start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It can again attempt to move, but must expend another MP to start—and must undergo another Stall DR as it does so. If the owning player forgets to make this Stall DR, the opposing player can thereafter call for it to be made at any time during that same MPh as the AFV expends any MP. An AFV that stalls is subject to Defensive First Fire (since it has expended a MP to start), but not as a moving target unless it had already entered a new hex during the same MPh. Should a Stall result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, the AFV is considered to have expended its entire MP allotment in Delay.</p>
<p><a id="i"></a><span class="f_Strong">I.</span> Uses red To Hit numbers. The &quot;(i)&quot; in the piece name indicates &quot;Italian&quot;, for ESB purposes.</p>
<p><a id="j"></a><span class="f_Strong">J.</span> AAMG may not fire within the VCA—as signified by &quot;MG: NA VCA&quot; printed on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="k"></a><span class="f_Strong">K.</span> A Tiger crew was the creme de la creme of the Panzer force. Therefore, as an inherent crew its morale is 9 (signified by &quot;ML:9&quot; on the counter), and the Tiger's printed APCR Depletion number (if one is present on the counter) is one higher than normal.</p>
<p><a id="l"></a><span class="f_Strong">L.</span> Vehicle has Low Ground Pressure (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">D1.41</a>)—signified by its identity letter being inside a square. Moreover, when this vehicle is bogged, one (only) CX squad (even a Prisoner—but not a Guard) on foot expending ≥ four MF in the vehicle's hex Location (and declared to be assisting its unbogging) thereby allows the owning player to subtract 2 (1 per crew/HS) from the colored dr of its immediately subsequent unbogging DR.</p>
<p><a id="m"></a><span class="f_Strong">M.</span> Optional AAMG RF is 1.3.</p>
<p><a id="n"></a><span class="f_Strong">N.</span> This vehicle was used in North Africa at some time from 3/41 to 5/43 (within the limits of its own given Date). If the superscript &quot;F&quot; appears, the vehicle was used in small numbers only (RF = 1.5; if normal RF is ≥ 1.5, North Africa RF = 1.6). If the superscript &quot;T&quot; appears, the vehicle's use in NA was limited to Tunisia, 11/42-5/43 (within the limits of its own given Date).</p>
<p><a id="o"></a><span class="f_Strong">O.</span> The AAMG is remotely controlled; it can fire only while the AFV is BU, cannot be used by a Rider, and may never fire at an aerial target (or one whose elevation advantage is &gt; the AAMG's range to it). Otherwise it is treated as a normal AAMG.</p>
<p><a id="p"></a><span class="f_Strong">P.</span> The AAMG may not fire outside of the VCA—as signified by &quot;MG:VCA only&quot; being printed on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="q"></a><span class="f_Strong">Q.</span> The CMG may not fire outside of the VCA—as signified by &quot;MG:VCA only&quot; being printed on the counter. Otherwise, it is treated as a normal CMG, but is available only after 9/44 (RF 1.3).</p>
<p><a id="r"></a><span class="f_Strong">R.</span> RF is l.5 in 1943.</p>
<p><a id="s"></a><span class="f_Strong">S.</span> This AFV can have Schuerzen (<a href="chd_chd11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">D11.2</a>).</p>
<p><a id="a2"></a><span class="f_Strong">a.</span> &nbsp;This vehicle uses French modifiers for ESB, thus the &quot;(f)&quot; after the name of the vehicle.</p>
<p><a id="b2"></a><span class="f_Strong">b.</span> The CMG may be repositioned as a 2 FP AAMG. This can be done only by placing an AA counter on the AFV at the end of any friendly fire phase (not MPh) in which its Inherent crew is CE and could have fired the MG (even if malfunctioned) but did not. This AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within the AFV's TCA—as signified by &quot;AAMG:TCA only&quot; on the counter. The AAMG may be repositioned as the CMG by using the same principles to remove the AA counter.</p>
<p><a id="c2"></a><span class="f_Strong">c.</span> &nbsp;The CE DRM is +1 vs Indirect Fire, as well as vs Direct Fire that emanates from within the turret's rear Target Facing—as signified by &quot;CE:+1 RT&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="d2"></a><span class="f_Strong">d.</span> &nbsp;Before any type of Immobilization result due to an attack [EXC: one caused by mines, or by a Direct Fire hit vs the front or rear Target Facing] takes effect vs this AFV, a subsequent dr must be made. If this dr is ≤ 4, Immobilization occurs; if ≥ 5, it does not. This is signified on the counter by &quot;Immob: dr ≤ 4&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="e2"></a><span class="f_Strong">e.</span> This vehicle is only available for use in Normandy, France.</p>
<p><a id="f2"></a><span class="f_Strong">f.</span> &nbsp;Use German-color French LMG for a MG scrounged from this vehicle.</p>
