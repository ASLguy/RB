<p>Italian ordnance used a &quot;#/#'' system of nomenclature, with the first number giving the caliber size in mm and the second the barrel length in calibers. If additional identification was needed, the model year was added as a suffix.</p>
<p>[Note: All Allied Italian combat formations were re-equipped by the British in early 1945. Therefore, for DYO scenarios set in that year, the Allied-Italian player may purchase British 76*-MTR/AT/88-ART/40LAA (only), as if his OB were British. He treats such Guns as non-Captured.]</p>

<p><a id="1"></a><img src="italo004.jpg" width="128" height="56" alt="ItalO004" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">1. Mortaio da 45 &quot;Brixia&quot;:</span> This weapon, the standard &quot;assault and support&quot; mortar of the Italian Army, was accepted for service in 1935 and first saw action in East Africa that same year. Its design embodied a number of unusual— and overly complex—features. Instead of being fired by simply dropping a round down the muzzle, a lever arm was pulled to open the top of the breech, and the projectile (a standard grenade with a finned attachment at the rear) was hand-loaded through the opening; the lever was then pushed to insert a firing cartridge (from a ten-round magazine) and close the breech. Firing was accomplished by squeezing a trigger. Range could be varied by the normal method of setting elevation, and also by an adjustable gas port which vented a portion of the propellent gas. In action the firer normally lay prone, with his chest on a padded frame cushion attached to the mortar's rear leg. For transport, the legs folded and the entire weapon was worn like a backpack, with the cushion easing the load on the bearer's back.</p>
<p>The &quot;Brixia&quot; (its designer's name) was normally used in mortar squads of three weapons each. Three such squads formed a platoon, two of which were authorized in the SW company (compagnia armi di accompagna-mento) of an infantry battalion. The battalion often assigned one or two of these squads to each of its rifle companies. In an Alpini battalion, each company usually contained an inherent Brixia squad instead. Bersaglieri, cavalry and Libyan units were not normally authorized 45mm mortars. Some divisional 81mm mortar battalions contained a company of three Brixia platoons in lieu of one 81mm company until such time as the latter could be provided. Early in the war the Italians also received a number of ex-French 60mm mortars.</p>
<p>Frontline use of the Brixia declined as the war progressed, especially in North Africa where by 1942 it was no longer even authorized in first-line divisions. However, in late 1943 when the first Allied Italian units were being formed, each battalion was authorized 18 Brixias. Large numbers of Brixias and other types of Italian SW were used by partisans in the Balkans.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><img src="italo006.jpg" width="169" height="75" alt="ItalO006" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. Mortaio da 81/14:</span> First used in Ethiopia in 1936, the 81/14 was a close copy of the French Brandt 81mm mortar. It fired both light (7-lb) and heavy (15-lb) bombs, and had the longest range of any medium mortar used during the war. Its ammunition was interchangeable with that of U.S. and French 81mm mortars, and it could also fire German 81mm rounds to just over 2000m. Blackshirt legions, and the infantry regiments in normal, motorized and &quot;truckable&quot; (autotrasportabile) infantry divisions were usually authorized one company of 81/14s each. However, 1942 &quot;North-Africa Type&quot; (TipoAS) infantry regiments, as well as Alpini regiments, were authorized a company in each battalion instead. Cavalry, Libyan, parachute and Bersaglieri regiments normally contained no 81/14s (though in North Africa some of the latter actually did at one time or another). Both infantry and autotrasportabile divisions—except those designated Tipo AS—were also authorized a divisional mortar battalion of three companies. The &quot;Pasubio&quot; and &quot;Torino&quot; autotrasportabile divisions each had two such battalions in Russia. An 81mm mortar company comprised three platoons of two (sometimes three, especially later in North Africa) mortars each. A number of Polish prewar M28 81mm mortars were also supplied to the Italians.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/40-5/41 (1.3), 6/41-4/42 (1.2), 5-12/42 (1.1), and 1-5/43 (1.0). For East Africa they are 6/40-6/41 (1.3) and 7-11/41 (1.4). For Russia they are 8/41-1/43 (1.1), 2/43 (1.3), and 3/43 (1.5). Elsewhere they are 6/40-9/43 (1.2), 10-11/43 (1.3), 12/43 (1.2), 1944 (1.1), and 1945 (1.1; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="italo008.jpg" width="124" height="58" alt="ItalO008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. Fucile-cc S:</span> Like several other nations, Italy adopted a Swiss 20mm ATR—in this case the sl8-1000 (and the very similar si8-1100) which in Italian service was designated the Fucile-controcarro S (anti-tank rifle Solothurn). It was capable of single-shot and semi-automatic fire (or full-auto in the 1100 version) from either a small two-wheeled carriage or an attached bipod. It was first issued in 1940, two per battalion, to troops in North Africa (especially Bersaglieri and Libyan units). Later, as its availability increased, its employment became more widespread and as many as six per battalion were authorized. Fucile-cc S were often manned by the ex-crews of 45mm mortars being taken out of frontline service. Another ATR used by the Italians was the Polish Marosczek wz 35. The Germans captured about 2,000 of these in September 1939, and during the winter of 1941-42 they turned over the bulk of them to the Italian forces in Russia.</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> The AP Basic To Kill number of the 20L ATR is &quot;6&quot;; that of the 1PP (ex-Polish) ATR is &quot;5&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="italo010.jpg" width="169" height="73" alt="ItalO010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. Cannone-cc da 37/45:</span> This was a license-built version of the German 3.7cm PaK 35/36. Apparently it was not widely used, and little has come to light regarding its employment. (Indeed, even Italian documents rarely mention it.) North-African-type Bersaglieri truckborne and motorcycle companies were each authorized a platoon of two 37/45, and some (carried and usually fired enportee) were encountered by the British during the early fighting in Cyrenaica. Apparently this use in North Africa was its only significant combat service—though in the 1930s two companies had been used by Italian troops in the Spanish Civil War. </p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/40-2/41 (1.4) and 3-12/41 (1.5).</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="italo012.jpg" width="169" height="74" alt="ItalO012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. Cannone da 47/32:</span> This was the Boehler M1935, designed in Austria, which the Italians produced in several licensed versions. They used it as an AT gun, for infantry support and as pack artillery, while modified versions were used in the M13-M14 tanks and SMV 47/32. One drawback to its design was the lack of a gunshield; another was that those built prior to 1939 lacked a towing eyelet, so had to be manhandled or carried en portee. Overall it was a good gun, but due to the lack of a suitable replacement it had to soldier on long after becoming obsolete. In mid 1940 there were 928 in Italian service (including 127 in Libya); by Sept. 1943 more than 3,000 had been produced. &nbsp;47/32 were employed in the divisional AT company generally authorized in each normal and &quot;truckable&quot; (autotrasportabile) infantry, Celere, Black-shirt and Libyan division. Each motorized infantry regiment was authorized a company, as was each Bersaglieri regiment; however, by mid 1941 many of the latter had one company per battalion instead. Since it was planned that 47/32 eventually would replace all 65/17 in the infantry support role, some regiments possessed a 47/32 company instead of their 65/17 battery— and, from early 1942, infantry regiments in North Africa were each authorized twelve 47/32 instead. Since the gun could be paradropped, the &quot;Folgore&quot; parachute division used it as divisional artillery—and some of this division's regiments and battalions contained a 47/32 company apiece. A number of 47/32 AT battalions also existed; aside from being used at corps level, by mid 1941 one was generally attached to each armored division. Most divisions sent to Russia contained at least two divisional AT companies. A 47/32 company usually comprised eight guns in four platoons. Apparently no 47/32 were sent to Italian East Africa.</p>
<p>Other AT guns used by the Italians included a small number of German 7.5cm PaK 97/38 (36 were turned over to the 8th Army in Russia), 7.5cm PaK 40 (a few) and 8.8cm FlaK (a small number were used in North Africa), and the French 25mm mle 1934.</p>
<p>†The 47/32 may not be towed in any scenario set prior to August 1941—as signified by &quot;TowedA1 + &quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/40-5/41 (1.2), 6-10/41 (1.1), 11/41-4/42 (1.0), and 5/42-5/43 (.9). For Russia they are 8/41-1/43 (1.0), 2/43 (1.2) and 3/43 (1.4). Elsewhere [EXC: NA in East Africa] they are 6/40-9/43 (1.3), 10-11/43 (1.6), 12/43 (1.3), 1944 (1.2), and 1945 (1.2; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="italo014.jpg" width="168" height="76" alt="ItalO014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. &nbsp; Cannone da 65/17:</span> This was an Italian-made mountain gun dating from 1913. Alpini units used it in WW1, but by 1940 it had been relegated mainly to infantry support. In mid 1940 there were 700 in service, including 146 in Libya and 312 in Italian East Africa. Blackshirt legions, and the infantry regiments in both normal and &quot;truck-able&quot; (autotrasportabile) infantry divisions, were each authorized one battery of four 65/17 (though some used 47/32 instead; see Note 5 above). In a few rare cases—mostly in East Africa—65/17 were employed as divisional artillery. (They had also been used thusly by the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War.)</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6-12/40 (1.1), 1-10/41 (1.2), 11/41-4/42 (1.3), 5-12/42 (1.4), and 1-5/43 (1.5). For East Africa they are 6/40-6/41 (1.0) and 7-11/41 (1.1). For Russia they are 8/41-42 (1.1), 1/43 (1.5) and 2-3/43 (1.6). Elsewhere they are 6/40-9/43 (1.1), and 1944-45 (1.3; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="italo016.jpg" width="168" height="76" alt="ItalO016" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. &nbsp;Cannone da 70/15:</span> This ancient gun, which lacked any type of recoil mechanism, was first produced in 1902 as a mountain artillery piece for Alpini units. It was later superseded by the 65/17 and passed to the infantry. Its only significant use in combat during WW2 occurred in Italian East Africa, where 92 were present in July 1940. It was probably employed at the regimental level, like the 65/17. tRF for use in East Africa is 1.2 for 6/40-6/41 and 1.3 for 7-11/41.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="italo018.jpg" width="170" height="77" alt="ItalO018" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. &nbsp;Obice da 75/13:</span> The Skoda 7.5cm vz 15 was one of the most successful mountain howitzers ever produced. Many were taken over by the Italians after WW1 and, designated the 75/13, were issued to Alpini units to replace their 65/17. In mid 1940 the army had 1,187 75/13 in service, including 32 in Italian East Africa. An Alpini regiment, whose structure allowed it to operate independently whenever necessary, often had a 75/13 battalion (gruppo) directly attached, one battery (four guns) of which could in turn be assigned to each of the regiment's battalions. Each of the three Alpini divisions sent to Russia in 1942 contained two 75/13 battalions in its artillery regiment. 75/13 were occasionally used as divisional artillery by other types of divisions as well. †Dates and RF for use in Russia are 9-12/42 (1.3), 1/43 (1.2), 2/43 (1.5), and 3/43 (1.6). For East Africa they are 6/40-6/41 (1.5) and 7-11/41 (1.6). Elsewhere [EXC: NA in North Africa] they are 6/40-9/43 (1.2), 1944 (1.4), and 1945 (1.4; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="italo020.jpg" width="170" height="75" alt="ItalO020" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. &nbsp;Cannone da 75/27:</span> This was the standard light field piece in the artillery regiment of most Italian &nbsp;divisions. &nbsp; The game piece actually represents four different pre-WWl guns that are equivalent in game terms and historical role: the 75/27 m06, mi1 and mi2, and the 77/28. The m06 was a license-built Krupp product, 51 of which were later modified by the Italians, becoming the mi2. The mi1 was an import from France, notable for being the first service artillery piece in the world to have split trails. The 77/28 was a Skoda-built combination field/mountain gun; among other uses it was issued to Italy's two Libyan divisions. In mid 1940 there were 3,091 75/27 in army service (including 499 in Libya and 24 in Italian East Africa), plus 245 77/28. A battery comprised four guns. During the Spanish Civil War the 75/27 was employed by some Nationalist units as divisional artillery.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in East Africa are 6/40-6/41 (1.3) and 7-11/41 (1.4). Elsewhere they are 6/40-9/43 (1.2), and 1944-45 (1.4; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="italo022.jpg" width="170" height="77" alt="ItalO022" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. &nbsp;Obice da 75/18: </span>This game piece represents two guns: the 75/18 m34, which was a modern mountain howitzer derived in 1934 from the 75/13; &nbsp;and the 75/18 m35, &nbsp;a normal field howitzer derived from the m34. In June 1940 only 114 m34 were in service, and by Sept. 1942 only 230 m34 and 68 m35 had been produced. (Another 54 of the latter were built by mid 1943.) Both types were employed as divisional artillery in a few select units, mostly in North Africa and Russia. A battery comprised four guns. This ordnance was also used as the MA of the Semovente 75/18, which is one reason relatively few of the towed versions were built.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 11/41-5/43 (1.4). For Russia they are 7-12/42 (1.3), 1/43 (1.5) and 2-3/43 (1.6). Elsewhere they are 42-9/43 (1.5), 12/43 (1.5), 1944 (1.4), and 1945 (1.4; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><img src="italo024.jpg" width="170" height="76" alt="ItalO024" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. &nbsp;Cannone da 75/32:</span> The 75/32 was virtually identical to the 75/18 m35, but possessed a longer barrel for increased muzzle velocity and range. It was accepted in 1937 but did not enter production until 1940. By Sept. 1942 only 39 had been built—and by mid 1943 only 98 more had been produced. Though intended as an artillery piece, the 75/32 was used primarily as an AT gun—most notably in Russia where 36 were employed in the three battalions (gruppi) of the 201st Motorized AT Regiment, with four guns per battery. Apparently only a very small number were sent to North Africa, and saw little if any action there. †Dates and RF for use in Russia are 8-12/42 (1.4) and 1-3/43 (1.6). For Italy they are 9/43 (1.5).</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><img src="italo026.jpg" width="169" height="75" alt="ItalO026" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">12. &nbsp;Obice da 100/17:</span> Another old Austro-Hungarian howitzer—in this case the Skoda 10cm vz 14. A large number were taken over by Italy in 1918, some of which were used in the Spanish Civil War. In mid 1940 there were 1,524 in Italian service (including 172 in Libya and 14 in Italian East Africa), plus 181 Skoda 10cm vz 16, which was a mountain version. In addition, the Germans later gave the Italians 400 of the vz 14/19 (which the latter designated the 100/22), an improved version of the vz 14. The Italians used the 100/17 as a companion piece to the 75/27 in the artillery regiment of various divisions; however, as the war progressed it tended to be supplanted by the 105/28. In Russia the 100/17 was employed only by the &quot;Pasubio&quot; and &quot;Torino&quot; autotrasportabile divisions and the 3rd Celere Division; the first two each contained one battalion (gruppo) throughout the campaign, while the latter contained one only in 1942. An artillery gruppo normally comprised twelve guns in three batteries.</p>
<p>With its M# changed to &quot;9&quot;, the game piece also represents the 105/11, a French mountain gun used by the Alpini divisions sent to Russia.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/40-41 (1.3) and 42-5/43 (1.4). For East Africa they are 6/40-6/41 (1.5) and 7-11/41 (1.6). For Russia they are 9/41-42 (1.3), 1/43 (1.4), and 2-3/43 (1.6). Elsewhere they are 6/40-9/43 (1.3), 10-12/43 (1.6), 1944 (1.5), and 1945 (1.5; Fascist use only).</p>

The Italians used it as corps artillery, though it was also employed at divisional level in place of the 100/17. The game piece also represents the 105/32, a modified version of the old Skoda 10.4cm vz 15; it too was used at corps level. In mid 1940 there were 956 105/28 and 227 105/32 in Italian service, including (respectively) 97 and 0 in Libya, and 59 and 4 in Italian East Africa. The 105/28 was also used as a corps-level gun in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/40-41 (1.4) and 1/42-5/43 (1.3). For East Africa they are 6/40-6/41 (1.4) and 7-11/41 (1.5). For Russia they are 9/41-6/42 (1.3), 7-12/42 (1.2), 1/43 (1.3), 2/43 (1.5), and 3/43 (1.6). Elsewhere they are 6/40-9/43 (1.4), 10-12/43 (1.6), 1944 (1.5), and 1945 (1.5; Fascist use only).</p>

The first they designated the 149/12, and the second the 149/13. Some were sent to Spain where they were used by the Nationalists as corps/army artillery. In mid 1940 there were 592 149/12 and 490 149/13 in Italian service, including 37 in Libya and 4 in Italian East Africa (all 149/13s). Both types were used as corps artillery. Five battalions (gruppi) of 149/13 (48 guns total, four per battery) served in the three corps of the 8th Army in Russia. The Italians referred to corps-level guns and howitzers as &quot;heavy field&quot; (pesanti campali) artillery. Another corps gun used by the Italians was the 6-in. howitzer imported from Great Britain after WW1; In June 1940, 88 were in Italian service. Italy also produced a modern, efficient corps howitzer—the 149/19— but its rate of production was low and it apparently saw little combat. The Germans kept it in production after 1943 for their own use.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6-12/40 (1.5) and 1/41-5/43 (1.4). For East Africa they are 6/40-11/41 (1.6). For Russia they are 7/42-1/43 (1.4) and 2-3/43 (1.6). Elsewhere they are 6/40-9/43 (1.5), and 1944-45 (1.6; Fascist use only).</p>

It lacked a recoil mechanism, so ramps were placed behind its wheels to keep it from rolling farther backward each time it was fired. To further inhibit rolling, large flat plates were strapped around the rims of its wheels (as was commonly done during WW1), even though this reduced its towing speed to only 4-5mph. In June 1940 there were 895 in Italian service. 149/35 were employed at army level in the Balkans and North Africa, with four per battery.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6-12/40 (1.5), 1-10/41 (1.6), and 11/41-11/42 (1.5). For the Balkans they are 10/40-4/41 (1.5). For Sicily they are 7-8/43 (1.6).</p>

However, as in so many other cases, the Italian arms industry was unable to effect rapid production, and by June 1940 only 39 were in service. In Sept. 1942 there were 36 in Russia, 12 in North Africa and three in Italy. A companion piece to the 149/40 also existed. This was the 210/22, accepted for service in 1938. Again, the number built was small: 16 were in service in June 1940, and only 20 in Sept. 1942. Apparently the 210/22 saw combat only in Russia, with the LXXIII Gruppo (15 guns). The Germans considered the 149/40 and 210/22 good designs, and kept both types in production after 1943. In 1941 the Italians received 38 German 15cm sFH 18 howitzers; designated the 149/28, 24 were used in Russia (in the XXIV and L Gruppi) and 14 in North Africa (in the CXXXI and CXLVH Gruppi). In Russia, all three of these gun types were employed in the 9th Army Artillery Brigade of the 8th Army, with four guns per battery. The Italians referred to army-level guns and howitzers as &quot;heavy&quot; (pesanti) artillery.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/41-11/42 (1.6). For Russia they are 8-12/42 (1.5) and 1-3/43 (1.6).</p>

Adopted in 1935, it was exported to China in the late 1930s, and about sixty were used in the Spanish Civil War. By mid 1940 there were 1,088 in army service, including 209 in Libya and 24 in Italian East Africa; by Sept. 1942 its total number had increased to 2,788 (including 326 on static mounts). An artillery regiment was normally authorized one battery of 20/65 if in an infantry division, or two batteries in most other types of divisions. By mid 1941 in North Africa, at least some motorized infantry and Bersaglieri regiments contained a 20mm battery as well (or instead). All divisions sent to Russia contained two 20/65 batteries—except for the &quot;Vicenza&quot; occupation division, which had none. A squadron of eight 20/65 (two per platoon) was authorized in the RECo (Raggruppamento Esplorante Corazzato; armored recon task force) of armored and motorized divisions. The 1942 armored division was authorized one battery each in its tank and Bersaglieri regiments, and two more (plus an additional section) in its artillery regiment. After 1943 the Germans kept the 20/65 in production for their own use. A 20/65 battery comprised four two-gun sections.</p>
<p>†When using Limbered Fire, the Barrel Length modification (C4.1) on the counter's LF side is used for To Hit purposes; the Basic To Kill number, however, is still determined using the Caliber Size and Length printed on the unlimbered side.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6/40-5/41 (1.2), 6/41-4/42 (1.1), and 5/42-5/43 (1.0). For East Africa they are 6/40-6/41 (1.5) and 7-11/41 (1.6). For Russia they are 8/41-1/43 (1.2), 2/43 (1.4) and 3/43 (1.6). Elsewhere they are 6/40-11/43 (1.3), 12/43 (1.4), 1944 (1.3), and 1945 (1.3; Fascist use only).</p>

Later they turned over 54 to the Italians who used them as AT guns in Russia, each division in that theater (except for the &quot;Vicenza&quot; occupation division) receiving a battery of six.</p>
<p>†This Gun's AP Basic To Kill number is &quot;16&quot;—as signified by &quot;AP TK#: 16&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†RF for use in Russia is 1.3 for 7/42-1/43, 1.5 for 1/43, and 1.6 for 2-3/43.</p>

In mid 1940 there were 76 in army service (including 8 in Libya and 24 in Italian East Africa), but by late 1942 only 226 had been produced. Two 75/46 battalions (gruppi) were included in the CSIR (Corpo Spedizjone Italiano in Russia—Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia) in 1941; on that front in 1942 the 8th Army contained five such battalions. The 75/46 was sometimes called on to double as an AT gun, a role it performed most effectively. After September 1943 the Germans used a number of 75/46, including on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>†RF for use in North Africa is 1.5 prior to 1942, and 1.4 for 1/42-5/43. Elsewhere it is 1.5 for 6/40-9/43 [EXC: 1.6 for East Africa, 7-11/41], 1.6 for 10-11/43, and 1.6 for 1944-45 (Fascist use only).</p>

It was an excellent weapon, comparable in &nbsp;many ways to the German &quot;88&quot;. Indeed, its maximum range exceeded, and its armor penetration roughly equalled, that of the German gun. Unfortunately for the Italians the 90/53 was never available in sufficient quantity, there being only 539 available in July 1943—the majority of which were in static emplacements. No 90/53 were employed in Russia. A battery comprised four guns. After Italy's capitulation, the Germans not only seized all the 90/53 they could but also kept it in production for their own use; at the end of 1944 they had 315 in service.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF are 5/42-9/43 (1.5) [EXC: NA in Russia], 10-11/43' (1.6), and 1944-45 (1.6; Fascist use only).</p>
