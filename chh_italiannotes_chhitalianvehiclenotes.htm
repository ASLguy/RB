<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the late 1930s the Italian Army officially committed itself to a program of mechanization, believing that if so equipped it could win swift and decisive victories, thereby avoiding the stalemates and appalling casualties of the Great War. Unfortunately for those ultimately involved in the impending conflict, the implementation of this program was severely impeded by a number of factors. Among these were a basic lack of raw materials, a relatively small industrial base with little experience in AFV design, a general lack of funds due to the financial stringencies of the 1930s, and the conservatism of certain highranking officers and officials. In the autumn of 1939 the army possessed about 1,500 hundred &quot;tanks&quot;, but the overwhelming majority of them were marginally useful L3 tankettes. When Mussolini declared war in June 1940, his army was far from ready. Its total number of &quot;tanks&quot; had increased only to some 1,660, while the army's rapid expansion had created widespread equipment shortages in areas from those as crucial as motor transport to items as normally taken-for-granted as helmets. Moreover, the approximately 11,700 infantry, artillery and AA guns of a 65mm in service included less than 250 modern (i.e., '30s-era) pieces—the newest of the remainder being World War One veterans.</p>
<p>The small Italian armaments industry could not, in view of everything working against it, provide prodigious numbers of AFV. From June 1940 to August 1943 it produced only about 3,300 tanks, SP guns and armored cars. The highest monthly total was but 170 vehicles, of which 65 were medium tanks. There was some discussion with the Germans of building the PzKpfw in, IV and V in Italy— but this withered on the vine for a number of reasons, including the opposition of several high Italian officials and industrialists.</p>
<p>Italian AFV were characterized by their light weight, generally low horsepower-to-weight ratio and thin armor (the latter a policy resulting at least in part from the constant shortage of funds and raw materials). The armor plate was of poor quality, tending to crack and split when hit; and was attached by rivets, which further diminished its overall integrity while increasing the danger to the crew inside. The design of new and radically better tanks was not accorded a high priority, due to both military conservatism and the loss in production that extensive retooling would cause. Indeed, Mussolini (who, unlike Hitler, neither fully understood the correct priorities in tank design nor took much interest in such matters) had to order the development of a tank with a 75mm gun (the P26/40), as the army saw no need for one. And yet, despite the absence in the field of more-combat-effective tanks and SP guns until nearly the end, Italian AFV crews continued to fight bravely in their obsolete vehicles even when hopelessly outmatched.</p>
<p>At the start of the war, the nomenclature for Italian tracked AFV followed the format &quot;letter #/#&quot;. The letter classed the vehicle as either light (&quot;L&quot;; ≤ 5 tons), medium (&quot;M&quot;; &gt; 8 but ≤ 15 tons) or heavy (&quot;P&quot;; &gt; 15 tons). The first number indicated the design weight in tons, and the second the year of acceptance.</p>
<p class="p_Emphasis"><span class="f_Emphasis">[Note: All Allied Italian combat formations were re-equipped by the British in early 1945. Therefore, for DYO scenarios set in that year, the Allied-Italian player may purchase British SC/LRC/APC/PC/trucks (only; as per their &quot;Type&quot; in the Listing) as if his OB were British. He treats such vehicles as non-Captured.]</span></p>

L5/21 &amp; L5/30:</span> Also known respectively as the Fiat 3000 A Model 1921 and Fiat 3000 B Model 1930, these were Italy's first series-produced tanks. They were based on the French Renault FT-17 but incorporated numerous improvements. (Indeed, the 3000 A was the fastest tank in the world in 1921.) The L5/21 carried two coaxially mounted 8mm MG, as did some of the L5/30; however, most L5/30 carried a medium-velocity 37mm gun and were intended as platoon and company command tanks. 100 L5/21 and 48 L5/30 were built. The Italians referred to them officially as assault tanks (earn d'assalto), and until mid 1939 considered them first-line AFV. The L5/21 was first used in 1926 against the Senussi in Libya. L5 saw action in 1936 during the conquest of Ethiopia, and in June 1940 a few apparently participated in attacks along the French-Italian border in the Moncenisio region. Two L5 companies, each of nine tanks, were in Sicily when the Allies landed there; one, in XII Corps, was deployed dug-in as pillboxes, while the other, in XVI Corps, was destroyed in the counterattacks on Gela. An L5 platoon comprised four such tanks. †Availability for WW2 scenarios is limited to 6/40 (France) and 7/43 (Sicily).</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><img src="italv006.jpg" width="171" height="76" alt="ItalV006" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. &nbsp;L3/35:</span> Derived from the British Carden-Loyd Mk VI tankette, this AFV first appeared in 1933. The original model, designated the CV 33 (Carro Veloce; fast tank), carried a single 6.5mm MG, but later versions were equipped with two tandem-mounted 8mm MG (and the older models were thusly retrofitted). In 1935 the CV 35 went into production, featuring a number of minor modifications (but both types are equivalent in game terms). In 1938 their designations were changed to L3/33 and L3/35. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, L3 were by far the most common Italian AFV, equipping all but two of the tank battalions in the three Italian armored divisions, the tank battalion allotted to each motorized division, the light tank squadron group (equivalent to a battalion) in each Celere (&quot;rapid&quot;; i.e., cavalry) division, and numerous independent tank battalions. L3 acquired several nicknames, among which were &quot;Scatoletta&quot; (little can) and &quot;Cassa da Morto&quot; (death box). Between 2,000 and 2,500 (including all variants) were built. A platoon comprised four vehicles.</p>
<p>L3 were used at one time or another almost everywhere Italian units fought: 10/35-4/36 in the conquest of Ethiopia; 2/37-3/39 in Spain (149 were sent); in the Balkans from 1939; 6/40 in France; in North Africa (where in June 1940 about 320 were present, constituting all the armor there at that time); in Italian East Africa (39 were present in June 1940); 9/41-1/42 in Russia (with the 3rd &quot;San Giorgio&quot; Gruppo Squadroni Carri L of the 3rd Celere Division); 7-8/43 in Sicily; and in Italy where after the 9/43 armistice they were used by Italian Fascists and the Germans. L3 imported during the 1930s were used in combat by the Greeks, Hungarians and Chinese. In the Balkans, captured/seized L3 were used by the Germans, Croatians and Yugoslavians.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 6-12/40 (.9), 1/41 (1.1), 2/41 (1.2), 3/41 (1.4), 4-11/41 (1.2), 12/41 (1.4), 1/42 (1.5), and 2/42 (1.6). For East Africa they are 7/40-1/41 (1.3), 2-3/41 (1.4), and 4-6/41 (1.5). For Russia they are 9-10/41 (1.2), 11/41 (1.3), 12/41 (1.4), and 1/42 (1.5). For Sicily they are 7-8/43 (1.4). For Italy they are 9/43 (1.2), and 44-5/45 (1.3; Fascist use only). For France they are 6/40 (1.1). For the Balkans they are 10/40-4/41 (.9), 5/41-9/43 (1.1), and 44-5/45 (1.3; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="italv008.jpg" width="172" height="75" alt="ItalV008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. &nbsp;L3 aa:</span> Some L3 were equipped with an AA mount on the superstructure roof in front of the commander-gunner's hatch. One of the AFV's MG could be moved to this mount, giving the vehicle a limited AA capability. Apparently not many were thusly equipped.</p>
<p>†Either MG may be used as the MA. However, the BMG may not be used while the crew is CE, and the AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within the L3 aa's VCA. These are signified respectively on the counter by the MA being given as &quot;MG&quot;, by &quot;BMG: CE FP NA&quot;, and by &quot;AAMG: VCA only&quot;.</p>
<p>†lf this AFV is marked with one or more Malfunction/Disabled counters, the owning player may in effect switch the positions of its two MG. He does this by marking the AFV with a TI counter at the start of its MPh provided it has neither fired nor expended MP in the current Player Turn, is in neither Motion nor Melee, and its Inherent crew is/becomes CE. If all these conditions are still met during the APh, he may then exchange the Malfunction/Disabled counter of one MG for that of the other.</p>
<p>EX: Assume an L3 aa has a malfunctioned AAMG. If the above-mentioned rules are followed, and the conditions are still being met in the APh, its owner may at that time remove the AAMG Malfunction counter and replace it with a BMG Malfunction counter.</p>
<p>†RF is always .4 higher (1.6 maximum) than the corresponding (for date and area) RF of the L3/35.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="italv010.jpg" width="169" height="74" alt="ItalV010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. &nbsp; L3 cc:</span> During the early months of the war a small number of L3 in Libya were modified by replacing their MG with a Solothurn 20mm ATR. This combination enhanced not only the AFV's A-T capability, but the mobility of the ATR and its crew's survivability as well. Apparently all the L3 cc were lost during the course of Operation Compass, the British counteroffensive of 12/40-2/41. †RF is 1.5 in 1940 and 1.6 in 1941.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="italv012.jpg" width="169" height="74" alt="ItalV012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. &nbsp;L3 Lf:</span> &nbsp;Development &nbsp;of a flamethrower (Lanciafiamme) variant of the L3 began in 1935. The flame nozzle replaced one of the AFV's MG, and the FT fuel was carried in a lightly armored trailer. The design of the trailer was less than satisfactory however, and before long new versions of the L3 Lf appeared with the FT fuel carried in a shallow, box-shaped tank above the engine compartment. (But apparently not many of the new types saw action.) The L3 Lf first saw combat during April 1936, in Ethiopia. It was used in the Spanish Civil War, and later in France, the Balkans, North Africa and Italian East Africa. Examples of the L3 Lf remained in service after 1941 but apparently did not see significant combat again. Each L3 battalion was authorized one flamethrower platoon (of four L3 Lf) per L3 company; however, the cavalry's squadron groups did not use the FT version. It is not known how many L3 Lf were built, but it was the most numerous L3 variant. One example of the trailered version captured by the British was sent to England for evaluation, and probably was the inspiration for the Churchill Crocodile.</p>
<p>†&quot;B11&quot; applies to the BMG; &quot;X11&quot; applies to the FT.</p>
<p>†The trailer's AF is &quot;0&quot;. It may be voluntarily disconnected (unhooked) only at the start of its MPh—but only if the AFV is in neither Motion nor Melee, has not fired in the preceding PFPh, and its Inherent crew is/ becomes CE. Under these conditions, unhooking is accomplished by declaring such, expending six MP in Delay, then exchanging the L3 Lf counter for an L3 aa marked with an AAMG Disabled counter; the AFV may then complete its MPh.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in France are 6/40, for North Africa 6/40-41, for East Africa 7/40-6/41, and for the Balkans 10/40-4/41. RF is always .3 higher (1.6 maximum) than the corresponding (for date and area) RF of the L3/35.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="italv014.jpg" width="168" height="77" alt="ItalV014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. L6/40:</span> Designed to replace the L3 in its cavalry and reconnaissance roles, the L6 was based on a much-modified L3 chassis, retaining the latter's two-man crew while providing increased firepower, protection and mobility. It was accepted for service in early 1940, though even in 1939 it would have been a barely adequate recon tank. By the time it went into general use in 1942 it was hopelessly obsolete, so after 283 had been built its production was cancelled in favor of the Semovente L40 47/32. A flamethrower version of the L6/40 was developed but did not enter service.</p>
<p>L6/40 were authorized in the RECo (Raggruppamento Esplorante Corazzato; armored reconnaissance task force) in the armored and motorized divisions, and were also used in several independent recon units. A total of 72 were sent to North Africa. 55 went to Russia where they equipped the LXVn Battaglione Motocorazzato Bersaglieri in the 3rd Celere Division; they were the heaviest Italian tracked AFV used on that front. In Yugoslavia, L6/40 were employed by the &quot;San Giusto&quot; Gruppo Squadroni Carri L of the 1st Celere Division. Some saw combat in Italy during September 1943, and later were used there by Italian Fascists and the Germans. The latter also employed them in the Balkans, but most of those they seized in September 1943 were exported to Croatia. The Yugoslav partisans also used a small number of captured L6. In Italian use an L6/40 platoon comprised four such AFV.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 12/41-6/42 (1.6), 7-9/42 (1.4), 10-11/42 (1.5), 12/42-1/43 (1.6), and 2-5/43 (1.5). For Russia they are 2-6/42 (1.3), 7-8/42 (1.2), and 9-12/42 (1.3). For Yugoslavia they are 4/41 (1.3) and 5/41-9/43 (1.5). For Italy they are 9/43 (1.3), and 44-5/45 (1.4; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="italv016.jpg" width="169" height="76" alt="ItalV016" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. M11/39:</span> This tank carried a small turret with two 8mm MG, plus a medium-velocity 37mm gun in the right-front superstructure. It was intended to be the standard tank in the armored divisions' medium tank battalions, but the positioning of the gun in a limited-traverse mount proved shortsighted and soon the idea of a tank with a proper turret-mounted gun gained favor. As a result, only 100 were built. 24 were sent to Italian East Africa where, as the Medium Tank Special Company (Compagnia Speciale Carri M), they served in the East African Armored Task Force (Raggruppamento Corazzato Africa Orientate). Another 70, comprising the I and II Medium Tank Battalions (Battaglioni Carri M), were sent to Libya in the summer of 1940—but by early February 1941 all 70 had been destroyed or captured by the British. An Ml 1/39 platoon comprised four such tanks.</p>
<p>†B11 applies only to the 37 SA—as indicated by &quot;B11: SA only&quot; on the counter. All 1MT (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.322" class="topiclink">D1.322</a>) penalties apply to the CMG MA, which has 360° traverse independent of the bow-mounted NT 37 SA.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for North African use are 8-12/40 (1.2), 1/41 (1.4), and 2/41 (1.6). For East Africa they are 7/40-1/41 (1.4), 2-3/41 (1.5), and 4-6/41 (1.6).</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="italv018.jpg" width="171" height="76" alt="ItalV018" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. &nbsp;M13/40:</span> &nbsp; Replacing &nbsp; the &nbsp; unsatisfactory M11/39 was the M13/40, which retained the main mechanical features of the M11 but carried a more powerful gun in a fully rotating turret. Its chief deficiencies were slow speed, unreliability, and a two-man turret in which the commander doubled as gunner. Nevertheless, in 1941 it became standard equipment in the growing number of medium tank battalions, and is perhaps the most famous Italian tank of WW2. It first saw action with the III Battaglione Carri M in the Sollum-Halfaya area of Libya, and later equipped the 132° &quot;Ariete&quot; Divisione Corazzata (132nd &quot;Ram&quot; Armored Division) in North Africa. The M13/40 also saw action with the 131st &quot;Centauro&quot; (Centaur) and 133rd &quot;Littorio&quot; (Bundle of Fasces) Armored Divisions in the Greek-Yugoslav campaigns during January-April 1941. For a short time in early 1941 one British armoured regiment (the 6th RTR) in Libya was equipped with captured Ml3/40, but lost them all during Rommel's first offensive. In September 1943, 22 were confiscated by the Germans who subsequently handed them over to the Fascist Italians. Sources conflict as to the total number of M13/40 produced, due to a number later being rebuilt as M14/41; some state as many as 1,049 while others claim only 710, but the figure most often given is 785. An M13/40 (or M14/41) platoon comprised four such tanks until late August 1941 when five were authorized.</p>
<p>†This AFV has no radio in scenarios set prior to 11/41 (see <a href="chd_chd14.htm" class="topiclink">D14</a>). As of 11/41 it is radio-equipped.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 12/40 (1.3), 1/41 (1.2), 2/41 (1.0), 3/41 (1.5), 4-5/41 (1.3), 6-10/41 (1.5), 11/41-6/42 (1.0), 7/42 (1.1), 8-11/42 (1.2), and 12/42 (1.6). For the Balkans they are 1-4/41 (1.3) and 5/41-9/43 (1.6). For Italy they are 9/43 (1.6), and 44-5/45 (1.6; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="italv020.jpg" width="170" height="74" alt="ItalV020" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. &nbsp;M14/41:</span> This tank, which entered production in the latter half of 1941, was actually the M13/40 with certain modifications to increase horsepower and enhance its reliability in the desert. The M14/41 saw combat only in North Africa, equipping the tank battalions of the &quot;Littorio&quot; and &quot;Centauro&quot; armored divisions—but first went into action with the XI Medium Tank Battalion of the 101st &quot;Trieste&quot; Motorized Division, which arrived in North Africa with a mixture of M13/40 and M14/41. Sources vary as to the number of M14/41 produced, ranging from 695 to 895—the latter being the most commonly stated figure. Only one was seized by the Germans in September 1943.</p>
<p>†RF is 1.2 for 1-6/42, 1.0 for 7-11/42, 1.5 for 12/42-1/43, and 1.1 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="italv022.jpg" width="170" height="76" alt="ItalV022" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. &nbsp;M15/42:</span> This, the last version of the M13 series, was slightly longer than the preceding models and featured a higher-velocity gun, more powerful engine and unproved armor. 112 were built before production was switched to the Semovente M42 da 75/18, and of that number 82 had been issued by September 1943. Their only use in combat by the Italian Army was against the Germans in that same month—most notably by the 135th &quot;Ariete n&quot; Division in and around Rome. The Germans subsequently confiscated 92 and in 1944 oversaw the production of another 28 (see German Vehicle Note 28), some of which they turned over to the Italian Fascists. The Germans also confiscated a prototype AA tank based on the M15/42 which carried four turret-mounted 20mm guns; some sources claim this gave them the idea for the Wirbelwind (German Vehicle Note 86). An Ml5/42 platoon comprised five such tanks.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF are 9/43 (1.2), and 44-5/45 (1.4; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><img src="italv024.jpg" width="171" height="74" alt="ItalV024" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. MR/35(f):</span> The Germans provided Italy with a quantity of ex-French equipment in 1941-42, the most significant of which was 124 Renault R35 tanks. The Italians installed radios in them and renamed them MR/35. They were used to form the CI and CII Battaglioni Carri M, both of which were destroyed in Sicily in the summer of 1943.</p>

<p><a id="12"></a><img src="italv026.jpg" width="248" height="75" alt="ItalV026" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">12. &nbsp;Semoventi M40 &amp; M41 da 75/18:</span> Inspired by the Sturmgeschuetz III, the Italians designed a similar AFV in early 1941 using the M13/40 hull and chassis with a box-shaped superstructure and 75/18 howitzer. Apparently 60 were built before production was switched in the latter half of that year to the same vehicle based on the M14/41 tank, of which 162 were ordered. Unlike the StuG III, the SMV 75/18 was intended to provide support and flank protection for medium tank units. In addition, it was often pressed into service as a TD, since compared to the M13 and M14 its armor was somewhat thicker and its gun had a longer effective range. Two SMV 75/18 battalions (Gruppi Semoventi 75/18) were assigned to the artillery regiment of each armored division, and several independent gruppi existed as well. Each contained two (sometimes three, in 1943) batteries of four (sometimes six) SMV each.</p>
<p>†SMVM41 75/18 Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 1-6/42 (1.5), 7-11/42 (1.3), 12/42-1/43 (1.5), and 2-5/43 (1.3); for Italy they are 9/43 (1.6), and 44-5/45 (1.6; Fascist use only).</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><img src="italv028.jpg" width="245" height="76" alt="ItalV028" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13. &nbsp;Semoventi M42 da 75/18 &amp; 75/32:</span> The last model of the SMV 75/18, ordered in October 1942, was based on the Ml5/42 tank and originally was intended to carry the new 75/34 gun. However, by March 1943 this gun was still in development so it was decided to install the 75/18 howitzer in the interim. Instead of equipping only Gruppi Semoventi, some SMV M42 75/18 were issued to tank battalions pursuant to a change in the tables of organization of these units at the end of 1942; whereas the old organization had consisted of three medium tank companies, the new TO&amp;E comprised one such company plus two companies of SMV 75/18. In September 1943, SMV M42 75/18 saw action in Italy against the,Germans who subsequently confiscated a number of them (see <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#39" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 39</a>). The exact number of SMV 75/18 produced is unknown, but 250 (inclusive of those built during the German occupation of Italy) is a generally accepted approximation.</p>
<p>In mid 1943 about 25 SMV M42 were equipped with a version of the 75/32 field gun. In September of that year they saw combat in the Rome area as part of the 135th &quot;Ariete II&quot; Armored Division. Subsequently, a number of those confiscated by the Germans were turned over to the Fascist Italians—as were some SMV 75/34 (see <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#40" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 40</a>).</p>
<p>†SMVM42 75/32 Dates and RF are 9/43 (1.5), and 44-5/45 (1.6; Fascist use only).</p>

Originally it was to be built on the hull and chassis of the P26/40 heavy tank (see <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#29" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 29</a>), but due to delays in the development of the latter a much-modified version of the M15/42 was utilized instead. Apparently its only Italian combat use was with the DCI Gruppo Semoventi in the 235th AT/SPA Regiment of the 135th &quot;Ariete II&quot; Armored Division during the defense of Rome. A battery of SMV 105/25 comprised four such AFV. About three dozen were built prior to the armistice. See also <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#41" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 41</a>.</p>
<p>It was envisioned that, once the newest AFV types were available in numbers, SMV 75/34 would be used as TD while SMV 105/25 would provide close support for P26/40 (see <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#29" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 29</a>) tank units. The SMV 105/25 would also be used for counterbattery fire, while the older (and shorter-ranged) SMV 75/18 would be relegated to infantry support.</p>

It was employed mainly as a TD in SMV 47/32 battalions (Gruppi Semoventi 47/32), but was usually relegated to infantry support due to its mediocre AT performance. A squadron of nine was authorized in the RECo (Raggruppamento Esplorante Corazzato; armored reconnaissance task force) in the armored and motorized divisions, as were two platoons in the NEC (Nucleo Esplorante Celere; fast recon group) of certain 1943-type infantry divisions. It saw action in Russia (19 vehicles in the Xm Gruppo Semoventi 47/32 of the 3rd Celere Division), Tunisia, Sicily and Italy. At least 78 were confiscated by the Germans, who retained a small number for themselves, handed over some to the Fascist Italians, and exported the rest to Croatia. About 300 were built, and a platoon comprised four such AFV (two, in an NEC).</p>
<p>†The Inherent crew is always CE (with all this entails) in the same manner as a British Carrier (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.84" class="topiclink">D6.84</a>)—as signified by &quot;Always CE&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in Russia are 7-8/42 (1.5) and 9-12/42 (1.6). For Tunisia they are 12/42-5/43 (1.2). For Sicily they are 7/43 (1.3) and 8/43 (1.4). For Italy they are 9/43 (1.4), and 44-5/45 (1.5; Fascist use only).</p>

Semovente M41M da 90/53:</span> This AFV consisted of the 90mm AA gun mounted on the rear of a lengthened Ml4/41 hull and chassis, with the engine moved forward from the rear of the vehicle to a central position. It was hurriedly designed and put into production in early 1942 but, due to the large gun's overstressing the chassis and engine, its manufacture was halted after only 30 of the vehicles ordered had been completed. Another drawback was its lack of space for ammo stowage, only six rounds being carried on the SMV; consequently it was accompanied into action by a turretless L6/40 ammunition carrier. Despite having been conceived and built specifically for A-T use on the Eastern Front, due to their unreliability none were ever sent there. Instead, 24 were formed into the 10th Raggruppamento Semoventi (comprising the CLXI, CLXII and CLXIII Gruppi) which remained in Italy until June 1943 when it was sent to Sicily. There it fought against the U.S. 7th Army in the Licata area, where all but two of its SMV 90/53 were lost. The two survivors were ultimately abandoned in Messina. The few left behind in Italy were later seized and used by the Germans. A SMV 90/53 battery contained four such AFV plus four ammo vehicles.</p>
<p>†Most of the crew actually stood outside of and behind the AFV while serving the gun. Therefore, it cannot use TH Case E (i.e., it cannot fire at all if a Known enemy unit occupies its Location), and receives only a +1 DRM for being CE (no DRM if attacked through its unarmored Target Facing; <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.311" class="topiclink">D5.311</a>) as signified by &quot;CE: + 1&quot; on the counter. See also <a href="chh_italiannotes_chhmultiitalvehnotes.htm#d" class="topiclink">Italian Vehicle Note D</a>.</p>
<p>†When an Ammo Vehicle (<a href="che_che10.htm" class="topiclink">E10.</a>) is called for by SSR or DYO purchase, use an SMV 47/32. This ammo vehicle has no Gun (place a Gun Disabled counter on it); instead its MA is a 2 FP AAMG (1 ROF; B11) which may fire only at a target that lies within its VCA. (Place an AA counter on it to signify the AAMG.) It also has a red CS#.</p>
<p>†RF for use in Sicily is 1.3 for 7/43 and 1.6 for 8/43.</p>

AS 42, AS 42 aa &amp; AS 42 cc:</span> The AS 42 (AS stands for Autosahariana) was derived from the AB 41 armored car but, unlike the latter, was unarmored and lacked a rear driving position. Designed specifically for long-range reconnaissance in North Africa, it had an excellent crosscountry range of almost 500 miles. It was also known as the Camionetta Desertica mod. 42 (Desert Weapons Carrier model 1942), and was nicknamed la Sahariana (the Saharan). Its armament varied, so three different versions have been included in the game. AS 42 saw action in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. After the armistice some were used by the Fascist Italians, and by the Germans (including on the Eastern Front and in the Battle of the Bulge). In all, about 200 were built.</p>
<p>†All versions of the AS 42 are termed Scout Cars in deference to their historical role. However, they are considered trucks for all purposes [EXC:</p>
<p>see <a href="chh_italiannotes_chhmultiitalvehnotes.htm#l" class="topiclink">Italian Vehicle Note L</a>]. MS 42 Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 11-12/42 (1.5) and 1-5/43 (1.4). For Sicily they are 7-8/43 (1.4). For Italy they are 9/43 (1.4), and 44-5/45 (1.5; Fascist use only). AS 42 aa and AS 42 cc Dates and RF are the same, but with .1 added to the RF.</p>

Lince:</span> The Lince (Lynx) was a close copy of the British Daimler &quot;Dingo&quot; scout car. It was first considered in 1941, and was accepted for service at the end of March 1943. Production, however, did not start until 1944; hence all went to the Germans, who handed over some to the Fascist Italians. It was used for reconnaissance and liaison. 263 chassis were built, but only 129 vehicles were completed.</p>
<p><a id="19"></a><img src="italv040.jpg" width="170" height="75" alt="ItalV040" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">19. Lancia 1ZM:</span> In late 1912 Italy became the first nation to use armored cars in true war operations, when several fought in North Africa during the Italo-Turkish conflict. Later, in 1915, the Lancia 1Z appeared; then in 1917 came the 1ZM, derived from the 1Z. Both Lancia types saw action in WW1. In 1928 the IZMs' MG were replaced by more modern types. Afterwards, 1ZM were used by the Italians from 1937 in the Spanish Civil War, in the conquest of Ethiopia in 1935-36, and later in Italian East Africa. Some were also exported to China in 1937. A squadron comprised six cars; a section two. Each 1ZM was equipped with special rails to enable it to drive through and cut wire.</p>
<p>†This AFV may clear wire as if it were fully tracked (<a href="chb_chb26.htm#26.53" class="topiclink">B26.53</a>).</p>

The 611A had two MG in the front of the turret, while the 611B carried a medium-velocity 37mm gun instead. Both types had a MG in the rear of the turret and another in the rear hull. Fiat 611 were used operationally in the 1935-36 conquest of Ethiopia and later in Italian East Africa. A total of 46 were built.</p>
<p>†For both types, availability for WW2 scenarios is limited to East Africa, with Dates and RF of 7/40-1/41 (1.5) and 2-6/41 (1.6).</p>

They featured a 4x4 layout with four-wheel steering and fully independent suspension, freely rotating spare wheels (midway along the sides of the hull) to help prevent &quot;bellying&quot; when crossing obstacles, and a rear driving position. The AB 40 carried two coaxial MG in the turret and a third MG in the rear of the superstructure; the AB 41 had a 20mm gun in place of one turret MG, as well as an increase in engine horsepower. 24 AB 40 and about 560 AB 41 were built. They were issued to the reconnaissance units of armored, motorized and cavalry divisions, and were also used in independent recon companies and platoons. An AB platoon comprised four such vehicles. The AB 40 was apparently used only in North Africa, while the AB 41 saw action on all major fronts (including 30 sent to Russia).</p>
<p>The Germans confiscated 37 completed AB 41 plus another 20 in production. They also seized prototypes of the AB 43, a new model with a larger turret, 47mm gun and more powerful engine. After ordering certain modifications (including a reversion to the 20mm gun), they had 102 of this type built for them, which they designated AB 41/43.</p>
<p>†AB 41 Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 8-10/41 (1.5), 11/41-5/42 (1.4), and 6/42-5/43 (1.3); for Russia they are 12/41-8/42 (1.5); for the Balkans they are 42-9/43 (1.4), and 44-5/45 (1.4; Fascist use only); for Sicily they are 7-8/43 (1.4); for Italy they are 9/43 (1.3), and 44-5/45 (1.4; Fascist use only).</p>

Autoprotetto S37:</span> This APC was based on the AS 37 truck, which in turn derived from the TL 37 AS, the desertized version of the TL 37 artillery tractor. The S37 was not intended as a carrier for armored infantry, but rather as a battlefield command/supply vehicle. However, it came to be used mainly for the escort of convoys in partisan-infested areas, predominantly in the Balkans. Apparently few if any were sent to North Africa. About 200 were built.</p>
<p>†This vehicle is treated as an armored car for movement (and all related) purposes [EXC; Reverse Movement costs it four times its normal hex entry cost— as signified by &quot;REVX4&quot; on the counter]; otherwise it is treated as an armored halftrack.</p>

Autocannoni da 20/65(b) &amp; 65/17(b):</span> These were Morris CS 8 15-cwt trucks captured from the British in North Africa and modified to carry a 20mm AA or 65mm INF gun. Two Gruppi (the XIV and XV) Autocannoni da 65/17 were formed, each of three four-gun batteries, and to each Gruppo was attached a section of four Autocannoni da 20/65. They were assigned to the artillery of RECAM (Reparto Esplorante del Corpo d'Armata di Manovra, the Italian corps recon unit), later to the North African Fast Task Force (Raggruppamento Celere AS), and still later to the 136th &quot;Giovani Fascist!&quot; (Young Fascists) Division. Autocannoni da 20/65 based on various other truck types also existed. The Italians apparently also designed other Autocannoni carrying 75mm and 100mm artillery pieces, but little has come to light regarding their development and use.</p>

In 1927 the same guns were remounted on more modern Ceirano vehicles, and these are what the game pieces represent. 24 were used by the Italians in Spain late in that country's civil war. Some also saw action in North Africa during the early stage of that campaign. The Autocannone da 90/53 was a Lancia 3 RO 4x4 (or, later, i Breda Dovunque 6x6) heavy truck modified to carry the 90/53 AA gun. Designed for a multi-purpose AA-AT role, it appeared in 1941 and first entered combat in two Gruppi of the Ariete division's 132nd Artillery Regiment. Apparently no more (and quite possibly less) than 57 were built. For both the 75/27 and 90/53 Autocannoni, a battery comprised four vehicles.</p>
<p>†Autocannoni da 75/27 CK RF for use in North Africa is 1.5 for 6/40-2/41 and 1.6 for 3-11/41. Autocannone da 90/53 Dates and RF for use in North Africa are 5-11/42 (1.4), 12/42(1.6), 1-2/43 (1.5), and 3/43 (1.6); for Sicily they are 7/43 (1.5) and 8/43 (1.6).</p>

Three of the more common models were, respectively, the Fiat-Spa Trattore Leggero 37 and Trattore Media 40, and the Breda Trattrice Pesante 32. All were 4x4 vehicles with large, oversize wheels and four-wheel steering (the latter to make them more maneuverable on narrow mountain roads). Most also had fully independent suspension. By 1942 the TL 37 was the authorized divisional-artillery prime mover for Italian units in North Africa. The TP 32 also represents other less common artillery tractors built in the early and mid 1930s. After September 1943, Italian artillery tractors were used by the Germans in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.</p>

These are generically represented by the Autocarretta or &quot;little truck&quot;. (The Autocarretta was actually a specialized vehicle originally intended for use in the mountains. Thus its designation applied to the game piece is somewhat of a misnomer, but is used in this broader sense for the sake of convenience.)</p>

Of 4 x2 configuration, it was produced in large numbers and several different variants. However, its use was limited mainly to HQ units (e.g., a normal infantry regiment was authorized only one—for the regimental CO). In German service it was designated the 1100 Mil. The AAMG version actually represents the Furgone— a conversion of the 508 to somewhat the equivalent of a modern-day &quot;mini-pickup&quot; truck—with twin Fiat MG mounted on it. About 50 Furgoni were thusly armed, and were used for the AA defense of convoys in North Africa. †When this vehicle is bogged, one (only) CX squad (even a Prisoner— but not a Guard) on foot expending ≥ four MF in the vehicle's Location (and declared to be assisting its unbogging) thereby allows the owning player to subtract two (one per crew/HS) from the colored dr of its immediately subsequent unbogging DR.</p>

The payload capacity and minimum top speed of the latter two were standardized in 1937, but otherwise the manufacturers were largely free to use whatever engines, tires, etc. they wished. This, along with the existence of many vehicles produced prior to the standardization policy, caused no end of problems with spare parts. Italy began the war with some 42,000 vehicles (excluding cars and motorcycles), and through mid 1943 produced about 108,000 cars, trucks and artillery tractors. Generally speaking, motor transport was in short supply at all levels throughout the war. Efforts were made to keep at least the forces in North Africa and Russia at full establishment, but production could not keep up with losses despite receiving Opel Blitz and French Citroen trucks from the Germans. Even pressing into service as much captured British transport as possible could not greatly alleviate the transport shortage in Africa. Aside from a few specialized types, the Italians generally did not use trucks to tow their artillery.</p>
