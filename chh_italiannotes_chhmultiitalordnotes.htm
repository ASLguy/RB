<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> &nbsp;This Gun may be Animal-Packed (<a href="chg_chg10.htm" class="topiclink">G10</a>).</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B. </span> This Gun may not use Target Acquisition (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">C6.5-.58</a>)—as signified by &quot;Acq. NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C. </span> This Gun may be carried en portee, which means it may be loaded onto a vehicle (during setup/play) and carried as Passenger PP. As a Passenger, the Gun and its ammo together use all but 5PP of the vehicle's Passenger capacity. The Gun may be porteed only by an Autocarro L [EXC: an Autocarro M for the 65/17; an Autocarro P for the 75/27] that, prior to setup, was noted on a side record as being able to portee a Gun of that particular Caliber Size (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">C2.21</a>) and Barrel Length (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">C4.1</a>).</p>
<p>The principles of (un)loading a Gun to/from portee status are the same as for the 2pdr Portee in <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#77" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 77</a>, except that here the Gun crew (un)loads as a Passenger rather than as an Inherent Crew, and a QSU Gun is not (un)loaded limbered. When a Gun has been thusly loaded, it is marked with an En Portee counter. A vehicle porteeing a Gun is not flipped over to its Wreck side if it becomes Immobilized, and the Gun may be unloaded (at which time the vehicle counter is then flipped over). If a vehicle porteeing a Gun is eliminated, the Gun is eliminated too. A vehicle may not simultaneously have one Gun en portee and another hooked up for towing. An AT (with a gunshield) being porteed can provide gun-shield benefits to its Passenger crew in the same way the 2pdr Portee MA does to its Inherent crew.</p>
<p>The 37L AT (only) may be fired by its Passenger crew while being porteed [EXC: it may not use Bounding (First) Fire]. While loaded on the vehicle, it is treated as a NT Gun able to fire only at a target that lies within its portee's &quot;rear&quot; VCA.</p>
<p>In a pre-8/41 DYO scenario, The Italian player may not purchase (as per <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.4" class="topiclink">H1.4</a>/<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.441" class="topiclink">H 1.441</a>) a towing vehicle for a Gun that is capable of being porteed; however, he may purchase a portee vehicle for it if he has paid the 10% expenditure for a motorized unit (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.4" class="topiclink">H1.4</a>) and/or if the scenario is set in North Africa. Otherwise he may use only Wagons to tow his Guns in a pre-8/41 DYO scenario.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><span class="f_Strong">H. </span>HEAT becomes available in September 1942—as signified by the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">S2+</span>&quot;.</p>
