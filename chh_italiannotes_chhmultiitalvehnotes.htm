<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> &nbsp;Make two To Kill DR when using the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a>; only one DR (firer's choice) is used. This is signified on the counter by &quot;2 TK DR&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B.</span> &nbsp;The 4-FP BMG may be Scrounged as one or two LMG (as per <a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">D10.5</a>); however, it is considered one MG for malfunction, repair and disablement purposes.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C.</span> &nbsp;If this AFV is non-turreted, its AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within its VCA—as signified by &quot;AAMG: VGA only&quot; on the counter. If optional, the AAMG is always available with a 1.4 RF.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D. </span> The MA may use neither Motion Fire nor Bounding (First) Fire—as signified by &quot;No Bnd(F)F&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="e"></a><span class="f_Strong">E.</span> &nbsp;If Stunned, this AFV may not regain CE status, may not fire any weapon, and is Recalled as per <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">D5.341</a>; these are signified by &quot;Stun=Recall &amp; CE/FP NA&quot; on the counter. The BMG, if present, may fire while the vehicle is HD—as signified by &quot;BMG HD FP ok&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F. </span> The MA and all MG have B11. This is signified by &quot;B11&quot; in red on the counter ( bold in the Vehicle Listing). If the vehicle is equipped with a hull Rear MG, that MG may be Removed as a dm MMG.</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G. </span> The MA may not use Bounding First Fire, or Motion Fire, through its VCA—as signified by &quot;BndFF NA VCA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><span class="f_Strong">H.</span> HEAT becomes available in September 1942, as signified by the superscript &quot;S2+&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="i"></a><span class="f_Strong">I. </span>The CMC of the MR/35, and the hull Rear MG of the AB 40, may be repositioned as a 2-FP AAMG. This can be done only by placing an AA counter on the AFV at the end of any friendly fire phase (not MPh) in which its Inherent crew is CE and could have fired the MG (even if malfunctioned) but did not. This AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within the AFV's TCA—as signified by &quot;AAMG: TCA only&quot; on the counter. The AAMG may be repositioned as the MR/35 CMG, or AB 40 hull Rear MG, by using these same principles to remove the AA counter.</p>
<p><a id="j"></a><span class="f_Strong">J.</span> The 20L MA is an ATR, has a maximum To Hit range of 12 hexes (as signified by &quot;[12 TH]&quot; on the counter), and may be Scrounged/Removed. It fires through its given CA in the normal manner. The MA of the L3 cc may not be used if it is CE, as signified by &quot;CE use NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="k"></a><span class="f_Strong">K.</span> If armed, this vehicle has an Inherent crew and thus a CS# instead of a cs#.</p>
<p><a id="l"></a><span class="f_Strong">L.</span> This vehicle is treated as an armored car for movement (and all related) purposes. [EXC: It may not cross a hedge. <a href="chh_italiannotes_chhmultiitalvehnotes.htm#m" class="topiclink">Note M</a> below also applies.]</p>
<p><a id="m"></a><span class="f_Strong">M.</span> Reverse Movement costs this vehicle three times its normal hex entry cost— as signified by &quot;REVX3&quot; on the counter.</p>

If the superscript &quot;T&quot; appears, its use in North Africa was limited to Tunisia, 11/42-5/43 (within the limits of its own given Dates).</p>
