Type 89 Heavy Grenade Launcher:</span> The Type 89 &quot;knee mortar&quot; was developed to provide the infantry with an indirect-fire capability at ranges out to 600m (the minimum range of the Year-11 Type 70mm mortar). Adopted in 1929, it replaced the older and much shorter-ranged Year-10 Type light grenade launcher. The Type 89 was unusual in having a rifled barrel and being trigger-fired, and unique in that range alteration was accomplished by turning a knob to move the firing pin up or down inside the barrel. Its projectiles included standard infantry HE and WP grenades (to which a finned propellant container would first be attached), and unfinned smoke and HE shells. Since a soldier could carry the dismantled mortar strapped to his leg, the Japanese sometimes referred to it as the &quot;leg mortar&quot;. However, a translation of this term as &quot;knee mortar&quot; led some Allied troops to believe it was meant to be fired with its curved baseplate resting on one's thigh—a notion that led to a number of shattered femurs. Initially, two Type 89 mortars were authorized per rifle platoon; about 1940 this allotment was increased to three (or in some cases four). One was also authorized in the infantry battalion headquarters. The Type 89 was used by both IJA and SNLF troops.</p>
<p>† The following special rules apply to the use of HE/SMOKE:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp; &nbsp;When firing HE at a range of ≤ two hexes, the ROF is lowered to &quot;1&quot; for that shot and Air Bursts are NA.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp; &nbsp;WP can be fired only at a range of 1-5 hexes, reduces the ROF to &quot;1&quot; for that shot, is considered Dispersed even when fired in the PFPh, and Air Bursts are NA.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp; &nbsp;Smoke can be fired only at a range of 3-10 hexes.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><img src="japno004.jpg" width="178" height="78" alt="JapnO004" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. Year-11 Type Curved-Fire Infantry Gun:</span> This mortar dated from 1922. It comprised a large, metal-reinforced wooden baseplate to which were attached the barrel, traversing gear and elevating screw. Unlike most medium mortars it had no bipod, its barrel was rifled and it fired unfinned projectiles. To facilitate rapid movement it could be carried on two poles which fit under hooks on the sides of the baseplate. Two 70mm mortars were authorized in the infantry-gun company of infantry battalions; however, in the 1930s they were gradually replaced by Type 92 70mm infantry guns. By 1942 few 70mm mortars remained in frontline service.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-41 (1.3), 1942-43 (1.4), and 1944-45 (1.5) [EXC: vs Russians they are 1938 (1.0), 1939 (1.5), and 8/45 (1.6)]. For use elsewhere they are 1941-42 (1.5) and 1943-45 (1.6).</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="japno005.jpg" width="177" height="79" alt="JapnO005" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. Type 97 Curved-Fire Infantry Gun:</span> This was a licensed copy of the famed Stokes-Brandt mortar, and as such was almost identical to the U.S. 81mm mortar; in fact, the light HE rounds of either weapon could be fired from the other. The Type 97 was generally used in non-divisional mortar battalions and independent mortar companies, though at times it could also be found in the infantry-gun company of the infantry battalion (in lieu of 70mm infantry guns). Toward the end of the war, some IMB contained an 81mm mortar platoon in each of its independent infantry battalions and/or one or two companies of 81s as brigade artillery. An 81mm mortar platoon contained four mortars, and a company comprised 2-3 such platoons.</p>
<p>† RFis 1.6 for 1938, 1.5 for 1939, 1.4 for 1940, 1.3 for 1941-43, 1.2 for 1944, and 1.1 for 1945. Use vs Russians is NA in 1938-39.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="japno006.jpg" width="174" height="78" alt="JapnO006" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. Type 97 Light Close-Attack Gun:</span> During the Manchurian Incident of 1931 the IJA found their 70mm mortars outclassed by the French-built 81mm mortars used by the Chinese. Noting that many nations were adopting this French weapon, the Japanese secretly developed a more powerful, longer-ranged mortar. This was the Type 94 90mm Light Close-Attack Gun which was adopted in 1934. However, due to having two heavy recoil cylinders which greatly increased its weight, this model was only a partial success. The recoil cylinders turned out to be unnecessary anyway, so in 1937 the IJA adopted the Type 97 which was nearly identical to the Type 94 aside from the absence of the recoil cylinders. As the Type 97 supplanted the Type 94 the latter was relegated to largely static roles. 90mm mortars were employed in the same ways as 81s but were more often found in non-divisional mortar units. Both 90mm types were normally carried in special wagons or on pack animals.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-39 (1.4) and 1940-45 (1.3) [EXC: use is NA vs Russians in 1938-39]. For use elsewhere they are 1941-42 (1.5), 1943 (1.4), 1944 (1.3), and 1945 (1.2).</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="japno007.jpg" width="176" height="78" alt="JapnO007" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. Type 97 Medium Close-Attack Gun:</span> This was the largest-caliber Japanese mortar of conventional design. It was used mainly in non-divisional medium mortar battalions. By 1945 some IMB included one or two companies of 150mm mortars as all or part of their &quot;heavy artillery&quot;. 150mm mortars were sometimes used as coast defense weapons as well. A platoon comprised two pieces; a company, four.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-39 (1.5) and 1940-45 (1.4) [EXC: use is NA vs Russians in 1938-39]. For use elsewhere they are 1941-43 (1.6), 1-8/44 (1.5), and 9/44-45 (1.4).</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="japno008.jpg" width="136" height="60" alt="JapnO008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. Type 97 Automatic Gun:</span> This ATR was developed in 1937 to provide the infantry with a light-weight AT weapon. As originally designed it fired only full automatic, but later many were modified to fire semi-automatic also/only. It weighed 150 lbs. including its carrying poles and small gunshield, and was normally carried by four men using two handlebar-shaped poles. The Type 97 was apparently not built in large numbers for it was encountered infrequently by the Allies. Occasionally it was used for beach defense. When available it was issued to the infantry battalion's MG company or infantry-gun company, or to the regimental AT company. In many IMB, a platoon of two was authorized per rifle company.</p>
<p>† This ATR requires a friendly crew in order to be fired with no B# penalty; <a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.611" class="topiclink">G1.611</a>. Its BPV includes a crew as per <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">H1.3</a>.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.4 for 1938-39 [EXC: 1.1 vs Russians in 1938], 1.3 for 1940-43, and 1.4 for 1944-45.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="japno009.jpg" width="176" height="78" alt="JapnO009" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. Type 94 Rapid-Fire Gun:</span> This gun was used for infantry support and AT defense. It was small and light, and could be dismantled for man- or animal-pack transport, but was not designed to be towed by a vehicle. In most infantry divisions, a company of 4-6 Type 94 was allotted to each infantry regiment, and another platoon was sometimes present in the divisional recon unit. In IMB and IMR, the infantry-gun company authorized in each independent infantry battalion sometimes contained a platoon of Type 94. There were also a number of independent rapid-fire gun companies (with eight guns) and battalions (with twelve guns) equipped with the Type 94. Two guns formed a platoon.</p>
<p>Following the crushing defeat inflicted on them by Russian tanks at Nomonhan, the Japanese purchased a number of PaK 35/36 37mm AT guns from Germany; after making minor modifications they designated them Type 1 Rapid Fire Guns, but it seems that few if any of these weapons actually saw combat.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-45 (1.2) [EXC: vs Russians they are 1938 (1.3), 1939 (1.0), and 8/45 (1.1)]. For use elsewhere they are 1941-45 (1.0).</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="japno010.jpg" width="177" height="78" alt="JapnO010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. Type 1 Machine-Moved Gun:</span> The Type 1, developed in 1941, was the first Japanese gun designed specifically for the AT role. It incorporated features of both the German 37 mm and Russian 45mm AT pieces, including pneumatic tires which enabled it to be towed by vehicles (hence its &quot;Machine-Moved&quot; designation). It entered production in 1942, by which time it was already becoming obsolete against the heavier Allied tanks. The Type 1 was authorized in the same ways as the Type 94 Rapid-Fire Gun except that few were issued to regimental AT companies, IMR or IMB. In addition, each armored division was authorized both an AT battalion equipped with eighteen Type 1 and a mobile infantry regiment in which each rifle company had a platoon of two such guns.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1943-3/44 (1.6), 4-5/44 (1.5), 6/44-2/45 (1.6), 3-4/45 (1.5), and 5-8/45 (1.6) [EXC: 1.3 vs Russians in 8/45]. For use elsewhere they are 4/44-45 (1.3) [EXC: vs U.S. they are 7/43-5/44 (1.3), 6-12/44 (1.2) and 1-7/45 (1.1)].</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="japno011.jpg" width="139" height="58" alt="JapnO011" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. Year-11 Type Flat-Trajectory Infantry Gun:</span> This diminutive gun was a copy of the French 37mm mle 1916. After WW1 the Japanese modified it to increase its portability and rate of fire, and adopted it in 1922. In service it complemented the Year-11 Type 70mm mortar by providing direct-fire support for the infantry battalion, each of which was authorized two Year-11 Type 37mm guns in its infantry-gun company. It could be dismantled for man- or animal-packing, or could be carried fully assembled by four men using special poles which attached to its tripod. The Type 92 70mm infantry gun and Type 94 rapid-fire gun gradually relegated it to second-line and garrison use, but it remained in production until at least 1937.</p>
<p>† As signified by &quot;crew&quot; on the counter, this weapon requires a friendly crew in order to be used without the applicable penalties of <a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.11" class="topiclink">A21.11-.13</a>. Its BPV includes a crew as per <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">H1.3</a>.</p>
<p>This weapon may enter and be fired from all terrain types allowed to a HMG (e.g., an upper building level). As a SW it incurs no CA-change DRM penalty (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">C9.2</a>), but is subject to the woods/building CA restrictions of <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">A9.21</a>. It has no Gunshield, and its portage cost while dm is 3 PP.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-41 (1.3), 1942-43 (1.4), and 1944-45 (1.5) [EXC: vs Russians they are 1938 (1.0), 1939 (1.5), and 8/45 (1.6)]. For use elsewhere they are 1941-42 (1.5) and 1943-45 (1.6).</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="japno012.jpg" width="176" height="77" alt="JapnO012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. Type 92 Infantry Gun: </span>Commonly referred to as the &quot;battalion gun&quot; (daitaiho), the Type 92 was developed to replace the Year-11 Type 70mm mortar and Year-11 Type flat-trajectory infantry gun with a single weapon capable of both direct and indirect fire. Though much heavier than the other two guns, it was still extremely light for its caliber and could be rapidly manhandled from one position to another. In addition, it could be disassembled and animal-packed, or even man-packed if necessary. Its short range was not seen as a detriment, for it was to be used right up with the forward troops. Allied intelligence spoke of its unreliability and unpopularity, but its users do not seem to have shared these opinions. Each infantry battalion was authorized a platoon of two Type 92 in its infantry-gun company; sometimes two platoons were allotted, especially in independent infantry battalions. As originally organized, a SNLF generally had one or two Type 92 platoons; however, by 1943 they were often replaced by coast-defense/AA artillery. After WW2 the Type 92 saw further action in the Chinese civil war, and in the Korean, Indo-China and Vietnam conflicts. ERRATA: 70mm HEAT has a Basic To Kill number of &quot;12&quot;.</p>
<p>† This Gun may also use Indirect Fire, for which purpose its range is &quot;3-70&quot; hexes (if using Direct Fire it has no such minimum range). All rules applicable to firing a MTR (including the possibility of Spotted Fire and of retaining Multiple ROF) apply to this Gun for Indirect Fire purposes. However, it may not use both Direct and Indirect Fire in the same phase (treating the MPh and DFPh as one). Switching from Direct to Indirect Fire or vice-versa does not cause loss of Acquisition.</p>
<p>† RF vs Russians in 1938 is 1.3; otherwise it is always 1.0.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><img src="japno013.jpg" width="174" height="77" alt="JapnO013" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. Year-41 Type Mountain Gun:</span> This was originally the Krupp Mod. 1908 mountain gun, which the Japanese modified to reduce weight and proceeded to license-build. It equipped mountain (i.e., pack) artillery units initially, but in 1936 was turned over to the infantry who authorized a company of four in each infantry regiment for direct-fire support (sometimes two companies were allotted). Appropriately, it came to be known simply as the &quot;regimental gun&quot; (rentaiho). As originally organized, a SNLF generally had one or two regimental gun platoons (each with two guns); however, by 1943 they were often replaced by coast-defense/AA artillery. Despite its design age, the Year-41 Type remained in production and was frequently encountered by the Allies. The game piece also represents the Type 94 Mountain Gun which, in addition to replacing the Year-41 Type in pack artillery units (which themselves were commonly used as divisional artillery), was issued to certain IMB and IMR.</p>
<p>† HEAT becomes available in 1944—as signified by the superscript &quot;4+&quot;</p>
<p>† RF is 1.3 for 1937, 1.2 for 1938, and 1.1 for 1939-45.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><img src="japno014.jpg" width="175" height="78" alt="JapnO014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">12. Year-38 Type Field Gun (Improved):</span> After the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese imported 400 Krupp Mod. 1905 field guns, then built another 300 as the Year-38 Type. Later the guns were modified, resulting in the Improved Year-38 Type which remained the main divisional artillery piece of the IJA through the end of WW2. It also equipped independent field artillery battalions and was issued to some IMB and IMR. The game piece also represents the Type 95 Field Gun (which was adopted in 1935 to replace the Type 90 Field Gun) and the Year-41 Type Horse (i.e., cavalry) Gun. Two 75mm field guns formed a platoon, and four a company.</p>
<p>† This Gun's AP Basic To Kill number is &quot;12&quot;—as signified by &quot;AP TK#: 12&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Use vs Russians is NA in 1938.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><img src="japno015.jpg" width="176" height="79" alt="JapnO015" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13. Type 90 Field Gun:</span> The Type 90, based on a modern French design (the Schneider 85mm mle 1927), was the intended replacement for the Improved Year-38 Type. It was adopted in 1930 amid great secrecy, and was produced in two versions: with wooden spoked wheels for horse draft, and with pneumatic tires for vehicular towing (the latter being dubbed the &quot;Machine-Moved&quot; version). Once in service, however, it was found to suffer from excessive bore wear and, reputedly, recoil malfunctions. Consequently not many were built and, aside from appearing briefly during the initial advances of 1941-42, their use was confined largely to theaters like Manchuria and China where they would not be overused in heavy combat. However, the Type 90's anti-tank potential was noted as early as 1939 in combat against the Russians at Nomonhan, so later in the war some were used as AT guns, primarily against the Americans. The horse-drawn version was intended for use in divisional, and the vehicle-towed model was to be used in independent, field artillery battalions.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937^15 (1.3) [EXC: use vs Russians is NA in 1938], For use elsewhere they are 41-5/42 (1.3), 6/42-44 (1.6), and 1945 (1.3) [EXC: 1.5 vs British in 1945].</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><img src="japno016.jpg" width="175" height="77" alt="JapnO016" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">14. Type 91 10cm Field Howitzer:</span> The Type 91 was a fairly conventional howitzer, though somewhat archaic looking and extremely light-weight for its caliber and range. Adopted in 1931 and reportedly based on a French Schneider design, it was produced in both wooden-wheel and pneumatic-tire versions. It was used as the divisional medium artillery piece but was issued only to certain divisions. Some IMB and IMR employed it as well. Two Type 91 made up a platoon, and four a company.</p>
<p>† Use vs Russians is NA.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><img src="japno017.jpg" width="177" height="78" alt="JapnO017" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">15. Type 92 10cm Cannon:</span> Adopted in 1932 to replace the older Year-14 and Year-38 Type 105mm cannons, the Type 92 was a modern design with excellent range for its weight. It equipped certain field heavy-artillery regiments (yasen juhohei rentai), which generally used it for long-range and counterbattery fire. Two formed a platoon, and four a company.</p>
<p>† Use vs Russians is NA in 1938 and 8/45.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><img src="japno018.jpg" width="177" height="77" alt="JapnO018" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">16. Year-38 Type 12cm Howitzer:</span> Adopted in 1905, this was a modified Krupp weapon manufactured in Japan. It was issued to field heavy-artillery regiments, and despite its age was still being used in 1945 (e.g., a company of four was present on Iwo Jima).</p>
<p>It was the only standard 120mm artillery piece used by the IJA. ERRATA: The 120* AP Basic To Kill number is &quot;13&quot;.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.5 for 1937-42 and 1.6 thereafter [EXC: use vs Russians is NA in 1938 and 8/45].</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><img src="japno019.jpg" width="176" height="78" alt="JapnO019" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />17. Year-3 Type 14cm Naval Seacoast Gun: During WW1 these Vickers-designed 5.5 &quot; guns were the secondary armament of some battleships and the main armament of certain light cruisers, as well as being used on other types of IJN vessels. Later, many were converted to coast defense weapons and, still manned by naval personnel, employed in the defense of various Pacific islands. A company generally comprised four guns. ERRATA: The 140L AP Basic To Kill number is &quot;32&quot;.</p>
<p>† Use is NA vs other than Americans. See also <a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhmultijapordnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note E</a>.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><img src="japno020.jpg" width="179" height="77" alt="JapnO020" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">18. Year-4 Type 15cm Howitzer:</span> Adopted in 1915 to replace the older Year-38 Type 150mm howitzer, the Year-4 Type was one of the earliest (some say the very first) artillery piece of Japanese design. It was issued as heavy artillery to certain infantry divisions, and otherwise equipped field heavy-artillery battalions and regiments. For towing it was normally broken down into two loads (a time-consuming process beyond the scope of the game); towing it as a single load was possible, but overstressed the gun's long trail and often damaged it, rendering the gun useless. ERRATA: The 150* AP Basic To Kill number is &quot;17&quot;.</p>
<p>† While this Gun is being towed (i.e., not during the [un]hooking procedure), its owner must immediately make a dr (r) every time the towing vehicle has expended a whole multiple of six MF/MP [EXC: all Stop, Start and Delay MF/MP] in its current MPh. If this Original dr is a 6, the Gun becomes disabled (mark it with a Gun Disabled counter). This is signified by &quot;Tow Disable: 6 MF/MP&amp;dr*&quot; on the counter. When thus disabled the Gun is still considered hooked up, but once unhooked it is immediately removed from play.</p>
<p>† Use vs Russians is NA.</p>

Type 96 15cm Howitzer: The Type 96 was a modern, indigenously designed weapon adopted in 1936. It used the same ammunition as the Year-4 Type howitzer, but had a longer range and could be towed as a single load. Although it was the intended replacement for the Year-4 Type, a low production priority resulted in its merely augmenting the IJA's supply of 150mm howitzers. The Type 96 was used primarily in field heavy-artillery battalions and regiments. A 150mm howitzer platoon comprised two such weapons, and two platoons formed a company.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.6 for 1938-39 and 1.5 thereafter [EXC: use vs Russians is NA in 1938]. See also <a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhmultijapordnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note E</a>.</p>

Type 93 Twin-Mount High-Angle Machine Gun:</span> In 1933 the IJA adopted a licensed, modified copy of the Hotchkiss mle 1930 13.2mm machine gun, designating it the Type 93. (Which is represented in the game by the Japanese .50-cal HMG SW. Its caliber was actually 13.2mm like that of its French counterpart, but is considered 12.7mm for game purposes.) Also adopted, as the Type 93 Twin-Mount High-Angle MG, was another version with two Type 93 HMG mounted side by side on a 600+ lb. tripod that incorporated traverse and elevation gears and a seat for the gunner. Neither weapon was normally organic to IJA infantry units; rather, they were issued to various independent AA companies and battalions. Both types were also used by UN troops, with a company often Type 93 sometimes being organic to a SNLF. Apparently, two guns formed a platoon.</p>
<p>† Make two To Kill DR when using the 12.7 column of the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a>; only one DR (firer's choice) is used. Maximum range for To Hit purposes is 16 hexes.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.4 for 1937-10/43 and 1.3 thereafter [EXC: use vs Russians is NA in 1938-39]. See also <a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhmultijapordnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note E</a>.</p>

Type 98 High-Angle Machine Cannon:</span> Adopted in 1938, this was the standard light AA weapon of the DA, and was also considered a light AT gun. Aside from its carriage and special AA sights it was quite similar to the 20mm ATR; in fact, both could fire the same projectiles. Like many other Japanese weapons, it could be disassembled for animal- or even man-pack transport. Multi-barrel versions on towed and SP mounts were developed but did not see action against Allied ground forces. The Type 98 equipped field machine-cannon companies, which in all but a few cases were not organic to divisions, IMB or IMR. Such a company comprised six Type 98 machine cannons and six Type 93 AAMG. The Type 98 was sometimes referred to as the HO-KI Gun, apparently due to having been derived from a Hotchkiss design.</p>
<p>† When using Limbered Fire, the Barrel Length modification (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">C4.1</a>) on the counter's LF side is used for To Hit purposes; the Basic To Kill number, however, is still determined using the Caliber Size and Length printed on the unlimbered side.</p>
<p>† Decrease RF by . 1 for each year after 1939, until 1.2 is reached in 1944.</p>

Type 96 Single-, Twin-&amp; Triple-Mount Naval High-Angle Machine Cannons:</span> &nbsp; These guns were the standard light AA armament of IJN vessels. As the war went on, large numbers, still on their shipboard mountings and manned by naval personnel, were used on land to protect airfields, harbors and beaches. For beach defense they were often emplaced in bunkers positioned to bring fire on any approaching landing craft. A company of Type 96 generally comprised 4-6 mountings, with two per platoon.</p>
<p>† The Type 96 Twin-Mount and Type 96 Triple-Mount cannot achieve Multiple Hits (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.8" class="topiclink">C3.8</a>). However, when using the 25LL column of the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a>, make two (for the Type 96 Twin-Mount only) or three (for the Type 96 Triple-Mount only) To Kill DR; only one of these DR (firer's choice) is used.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for the Type 96 (single-mount) and Type 96 Triple-Mount are 1944 (1.6) and 1945 (1.5) [EXC: vs U.S. they are 1-4/44 (1.6), 5/44-1/45 (1.5), 2-3/45 (1.3), and 4-7/45 (1.6)]. Dates and RF for the Type 96 Twin-Mount are the same, but with all RF reduced by . 1.

Type 88 7.5cm Mobile Field High-Angle Gun:</span> Reportedly a loose copy of a 1922 Vickers weapon, the Type 88 was adopted in 1928 and remained the standard mobile AA gun of the IJA through 1945. There was nothing outstanding about its design or performance, but it was available in numbers and hence was widely used, not only in the AA role but also for defense against ground attack and as a coast-defense gun. It proved to be an effective AT gun on more than one occasion. About 2500 were in service during the war. It was issued to the various types of independent/field high-angle-gun regiments, battalions and companies; and, by 1943, some SNLF also contained a company. Two guns formed a platoon, and four (sometimes 6) a company.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.4 for 1937-10/43 [EXC: use vs Russians is NA in 1938-39] and 1.3 thereafter. See also <a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhmultijapordnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note E</a>.</p>

Year-10 Type 12cm Naval High-Angle Gun:</span> Originally designed for use aboard destroyers and various other UN vessels, this 4.7 &quot; gun was the most common Japanese dual-purpose AA/coast-defense weapon of &gt; 100mm. It was still being produced in 1944, and relatively large numbers were employed both to protect airfields and on the more important Pacific islands. A company generally comprised four guns, manned by naval personnel. By 1943, some SNLF contained two companies of these guns. <span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA</span>: The 120L Basic AP To Kill number is &quot;27&quot;.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF are 1944 (1.6) and 1-7/45 (1.5) [EXC: vs U.S. they are 7/43-4/44 1.6) and 5/44-7/45 (1.4)]. See also <a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhmultijapordnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">Japanese Ordnance Note E</a>.</p>
