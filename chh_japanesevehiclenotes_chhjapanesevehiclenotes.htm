<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After WW1 the Imperial Japanese Army purchased a variety of French and British tanks for use and evaluation, and in 1925 initiated its own tank development program. By 1933 several domestic designs were in or nearing production, and the first four Japanese tank regiments were formed that same year. The layout and many of the components of these early Japanese tanks bore the influence of European (especially British) designs, but as they gained experience the Japanese evolved their own distinctive style of AFV. Generally, Japanese tanks were characterized by their small size, light weight, good cross-country speed, and small-caliber armament with relatively poor anti-tank capability. Size and weight were kept down by both a low priority on materials and the consideration that all AFV going abroad would have to be transported on ships. Engines were of sufficient size and horsepower in most cases, and in 1933 the Japanese pioneered the use of air-cooled diesel powerplants in military vehicles. Suspensions were simple but effective. However, interiors were usually cramped and turret layouts were poor. Radios were the exception until late in the war. Crew survivability was reduced by (among other things) the extensive use of riveted/bolted armor plates, despite the Japanese having developed one of the finest methods in the world for welding armor.</p>
<p>Tactically, the use of tanks by the Japanese was unimaginative. With the Army dominated by its ultraconservative Infantry arm and lulled into complacency by the fighting in China (where its opponents had few effective AT weapons), tanks were simply attached to infantry units for fire support and the possibilities of armored manoeuvre en masse were left largely unexplored. The misleading 'lessons' of combat in China also blinded the Army to the gun-vs-armor race that occurred in the West after 1940, thus leaving Japanese tanks thinly armored and undergunned compared to the Allied tanks they encountered. (Indeed, by 1945 the Japanese often felt it necessary to dig in their tanks for use as mere armored pillboxes.) No tank divisions were formed until mid 1942, and none were used as complete formations in battle until 1944. The tank/regiment (which was actually of battalion size, with 4-5 companies) remained the standard combat unit, and piecemeal assaults of platoon or company strength (often conducted in the form of nighttime banzai charges) were the norm for tank attacks.</p>
<p>The low priority given to AFV manufacture combined with subsequent U.S. bombing raids kept AFV production low throughout the war. Around 3,000 tanks were built from 1931 through 1940 and approximately another 3,500 (including SP guns) in 1941-45, with about half produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Peak output was achieved in 1941-42 when some 2,200-2,500 were built. Several types of bridging, engineer, command, etc. variants were developed but few were used in combat. About 1,700 AFV remained at the end of the war to be surrendered to the Allies. (And of the equipment seized by the Russians in Manchuria, most was passed on to the Chinese Communists.)</p>
<p>There were two main styles of nomenclature for Japanese ordnance equipment. An item accepted for service prior to 1926 had a model number corresponding to the year of the emperor's reign in which it was adopted; e.g., a gun's being designated a 'Year-38 Type' meant that it had been adopted in the 38th year of the then-current emperor's reign. From 1926 the model number was based on the year of adoption expressed in relation to 660 BC (the beginning of the first Japanese emperor's reign); thus the designation 'Type 97' indicated that the item had been adopted in the Japanese year 2597 (1937 according to the Western calendar), while 'Type 1' meant adoption in 2601 (1941). For vehicles, the type designation was usually completed with an abbreviation using two symbols from the Katakana phonetic alphabet; however, beyond 'KE' standing for 'Light' and 'CHI' for 'Medium', they were assigned with little rhyme or reason and most are not translatable into English.</p>
<p>[For the sake of brevity, the following abbreviations are used herein: IJA Imperial Japanese Army; UN Imperial Japanese Navy; SNLF Special Naval Landing Force. Also note that, as used herein, the name &quot;China&quot; includes Manchuria (Manchukuo), where Japanese and Russians fought each other in 7-8/38, 5-9/39 and 8/45.]</p>

Types 92A &amp; 92B Combat Cars:</span> In the late 1920s the Japanese studied the use of armored cars by the cavalry; however, due to the paucity of roads on the Asian mainland they decided to produce a full-tracked vehicle instead. This resulted in the Type 92 Combat Car, one of the earliest AFV of welded construction and probably the very first to use an air-cooled engine. Its standard BMG was a 13.2mm piece with special optics enabling it to engage low-flying aircraft; however, a regular tank LMG was often installed in its place, due perhaps to an insufficient supply of the larger-caliber weapon. During production the suspension of the Type 92 was altered, but its tendency to shed tracks was never fully rectified. Besides equipping the armored car company of certain cavalry brigades, the Type 92 served as a recon vehicle in some infantry divisions and was issued to a few tank units. It apparently saw action only in China. An amphibious version was built but never advanced beyond the prototype stage. The Type 92 was not produced in large numbers and apparently was withdrawn from service by 1941. Allied wartime intelligence erroneously called it the Type 93 (or M2593) Light Tank. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the piece names are our own designations, since the Japanese nomenclature did not distinguish between the different versions. &quot;Combat Car&quot; is actually a loose translation of Jusokosha, which literally means &quot;Heavy Armored Car&quot;. Alternatively, the Japanese sometimes referred to the Type 92 as a &quot;Light Armored Vehicle&quot; (Keisokosha), their equivalent of the term &quot;Tankette&quot;.</p>
<p>† For the Type 92B (only), whichever MG fires first in a phase is considered the MA for both that attack and the remainder of that phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase). If both MG fire as a FG, before making that attack the owning player must declare one MG to be the MA for that phase; if he fails to do so, the MA is determined randomly. The Type 92B (only) does not suffer Disabled MA Recall (D3.7) until both of its MG are disabled.</p>
<p>† When the BMG of the Type 92B achieves an ordnance hit vs an AFV (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.61" class="topiclink">A9.61</a>), use the 12.7 column of the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">AP To Kill Table</a>. This BMG also has AA capability within the Type 92B's VCA, even if HD, and without consideration of AA mode (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.5" class="topiclink">E7.5</a>; i.e., no AA counter is required). These abilities are signified by &quot;BMG: 12.7; AA*&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† RF for both versions is 1.3 in 1937, and increases by . 1 in each year thereafter [EXC: use vs Russians in 1938 is NA].</p>

Type 94 Light Armored Vehicle:</span> This tankette resulted from a requirement for a very small armored vehicle with good cross-country ability, to be used for the resupply of frontline troops and garrisons in hostile areas. To this end it was designed to tow a fully-tracked trailer, and for self defense it had a turreted MG on the rear of the superstructure. Those produced from 1936 had a revised suspension; U.S. intelligence called this later version the Type 94 (or M2594), having incorrectly labeled the original model the Type 92 (or M2592). Beginning in 1935, selected infantry divisions received a company of 6 (later 10) Type 94. Since these divisions normally had no other AFV under direct command, their tankettes came to be used mostly for reconnaissance and infantry support. Eventually a number of infantry regiments also acquired their own tankette companies (probably when the division's tankette company was updated with Type 95 HA-GO light tanks). Tankettes were used as command/liaison vehicles as well. Type 94 were employed widely during the early part of the war, but most ended their days dug in as not particularly effective pillboxes. A tankette platoon normally comprised three such AFV.</p>

<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 193*7-39 (1.1), 1940(1.2), 1941-42 (1.3), 1943 (1.4), 1944 (1.5) and 1945 (1.6) [EXC: vs Russians they are 1939 (1.4) and 8/45 (1.6)]. For use in Malaya-Burma-India they are 1941-5/42 (1.2), 6/42-43 (1.5), and 1944-5/45 (1.6). For use elsewhere they are 1941-1/42 (1.5), 2/42 (1.4), 3/42 (1.2), and 6/43-45 (1.5) [EXC: vs U.S. they are 1941-4/42 (1.2) and 6/43-7/45 (1.6)].</p>

Type 95 SO-KJ Armored Railway Vehicle:</span> This unusual AFV, like the earlier Type 91 Armored Car (<a href="chh_japanesevehiclenotes_chhjapanesevehiclenotes.htm#10" class="topiclink">Japanese Vehicle Note 10</a>), was developed by the Corps of Railroad Engineers as a rail-line patrol vehicle. However, unlike the Type 91, the SO-KI could change from rail to tracked mode while the crew remained aboard; its four steel flanged wheels were raised hydraulically into the vehicle's belly, so bringing the tracks to rest on the ground. Thus it was a much more practical design than the armored car, being able to launch an &quot;off-rail&quot; attack quickly when necessary. Like the Type 91, the SO-KI had front and rear couplers so it could be used to move small trains, and its wheels were adjustable to compensate for tracks of different gauges. The SO-KI looked like an enlarged Type 94 tankette but had no standard main armament; instead, its crew used their small arms and/or an infantry light machine gun through firing slits. (For simplicity the game piece is assumed to have the LMG mounted in the turret slit.) Most SO-KI were employed in China, but a few were used in Burma as well.</p>
<p>† The MA has a Normal Range of eight hexes, but may be Removed or Scrounged. These are signified by &quot;Nml Rng 8&quot; and &quot;Rmvl/Scrng OK&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-43 (1.4) and 1944-45 (1.5) [EXC: use vs Russians in 1938-39 is NA]. For use in Burma they are 1944-5/45 (1.6). Availability is otherwise NA.</p>

Types 97A &amp; 97B TE-KE Light Armored Vehicles:</span> Unlike in the West where the Spanish Civil War had shown the limited value of tankettes, their use against the poorly equipped Chinese proved successful. Combat experience led to progressive experiments with and improvements to the Type 94, and ultimately brought about its successor, the Type 97 TE-KE. The new design featured a medium-velocity 37mm gun, well-sloped armor and an air-cooled diesel engine, making it the most technically advanced tankette of its time. Since it was designed to function in the same roles as its predecessor it retained the ability to tow a trailer. Some Type 97 retained the MG of the Type 94 in lieu of the 37mm gun; these were intended primarily for the supply role, while the gun-armed versions were to be used for infantry fire support. Allied intelligence sometimes referred to the TE-KE as the M2597. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the piece names are our own designations, since the Japanese nomenclature did not distinguish between the two models.</p>
<p>† For both versions, Dates and RF for use in China are 1938 (1.5), 1939 (1.3), 1940-43 (1.1), 1944 (1.2), and 1945 (1.3) [EXC: use vs Russians in 1938 is NA]. For use in Malaya-Burma-India they are 1941-5/42 (1.3), 6/42-3/44 (1.4), 4/44 (1.3), 5/44 (1.4), 6/44 (1.5), 7-10/44 (1.6), 11-12/44 (1.4), 1-2/45 (1.5), and 3-5/45 (1.6). For use elsewhere they are 1941-1/42 (1.5), 2/42 (1.4), 3/42 (1.2), 6/43-4/45 (1.5), and 5-8/45 (1.3) [EXC: vs U.S. they are 1941-4/42 (1.3), 6/43-3/45 (1.5), and 4-7/45 (1.6)].</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="japnv008.jpg" width="174" height="80" alt="JapnV008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. Type 95 HA-GO Light Tank:</span> The inability of the lumbering Type 89 CHI-RO to function effectively with motorized units led to a call in 1933 for a lighter and faster gun-armed tank. The result was the Type 95 HA-GO, with a medium-velocity 37mm gun and the same air-cooled diesel engine used in the Type 89B but with an armor basis of only 12mm. Upon testing the prototype, the Infantry School called for heavier armor and armament while the Cavalry School found the design acceptable. Since the latter were expected to be its main user, their view prevailed and it was put into production without the infantry's suggested changes. Once in service the HA-GO quickly gained an excellent reputation due to its high standard of reliability. In fact, so great was its popularity that it was kept in production until 1943—far longer than its combat value warranted—while more up-to-date light tank designs languished on paper. The HA-GO first saw combat in 1937 with the Kwantung Army (Kantogun) in China. In due course it superseded the combat cars and tankettes in their various roles (most importantly in the divisional tank companies) and equipped several light tank regiments. By 1941 a company of light tanks had also been authorized in each medium tank regiment and a number of independent light tank companies had been created. In addition, the HA-GO was used by some SNLF units. A platoon (shotai) of light tanks comprised three such AFV, while a company (chutai) normally had ten. The Type 95's official designation was KE-GO, but the pre-production name HA-GO assigned to it by Mitsubishi was more commonly used. Its nickname was KYU-GO (&quot;nine-five&quot;). Allied intelligence sometimes referred to it as the M2595. Around 1,250 were built. The HA-GO, along with the CHI-HA medium, formed the mainstay of Japanese tank regiments (sensha rental) during WW2.</p>
<p><img src="japnv010.jpg" width="344" height="443" alt="JapnV010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />The IJA built several other types of light tanks after the HA-GO, but apparently all were assigned to units that remained in Japan. A number of M3 Stuart tanks were captured in Burma in early 1942, and the Japanese 14th Tank Regiment was still using them in mid 1944, losing the last one on the Tiddim Road in June of that year. M3 Stuarts were also seized in the Philippines in 1942; see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 2</a>.</p>
<p>† The center hexspine of the turret Rear (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.82" class="topiclink">D1.82</a>) MG's CA is always the second hexspine clockwise from the center hexspine of the current TCA; i.e., the Rear MG is located at the 4:00 position relative to the MA—as signified by &quot;4:00 from MA&quot; on the counter. See the accompanying diagram.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-38 (1.6), 1939 (1.4), 1940 (1.3), 1941 (1.2), 1942 (1.1), 1943 (1.2), 1-3/44 (1.3), 4-5/44 (1.2), 6-12/44 (1.3), 1-2/45 (1.4), 3-4/45 (1.2), and 5-8/45 (1.4) [EXC: vs Russians they are 1939 (1.1) and 8/45 (1.4)]. For use in Malaya-Burma-India they are 1941-5/42 (1.0), 6/42-2/44 (1.3), 3/44 (1.1), 4/44 (1.2), 5/44 (1.3), 6/44 (1.4), 7-10/44 (1.6), 11/44-2/45 (1.3), 3-4/45 (1.5), and 5/45 (1.6). For use elsewhere they are 1941-1/42 (1.4), 2/42 (1.3), 3/42 (1.1), 8-9/42 (1.5), and 6/43^5 (1.5) [EXC: vs U.S. they are 1941-4/42 (1.0), 8-10/42 (1.5), 6-10/43 (1.5), 11/43-6/44 (1.3), 7-9/44 (1.2), 10-12/44 (1.3), 1-2/45 (1.2), 3/45 (1.4), 4-5/45 (1.5), and 6-7/45 (1.6)].</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="japnv011.jpg" width="171" height="77" alt="JapnV011" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. Type 2 KA-MI Amphibious Tank: </span>The IJA built three different types of amphibious tanks in the period 1933-41, but only as prototypes. In 1941 the UN took over the development of such vehicles, and the next year produced the KA-MI—based loosely on the Type 95 HA-GO. The KA-MI featured two multi-compartment pontoons of steel plate, one fore and one aft, attached to the hull by clamps opened remotely from inside the tank. Propulsion and steering in water were provided by twin propellors and rudders. Another novelty for a Japanese tank was a MG mounted coaxially with the main gun. 180 were built, and were used by SNLF units. A few KA-MI saw action in the Japanese defense of the Philippines and various Pacific islands (e.g., Kwajalein and Saipan). Allied wartime intelligence sometimes referred to the KA-MI as the M2602.</p>
<p>† PONTOONS: The KA-MI is amphibious only while its pontoons are attached and functional. To detach them, the tank must be BU and Mobile, and must expend one MP in its MPh for no other purpose (but may expend it whether Stopped or not). Whenever the pontoons become detached, the tank counter is immediately (i.e., prior to further Defensive First Fire) flipped over to its non-amphibious side; its CA remain the same, but the extra MP gained may be used subsequently in that MPh if the tank is otherwise allowed to. Detached pontoons have no game effect and cannot be re-attached.</p>
<p>While the pontoons are attached, the following apply:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If the KA-MI is BU it must expend one extra MP per hex entered, just as if towing a Gun.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;It may not use VBM, enter a building [EXC: hut] or cross over a wall.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless utilizing a road/TB, it may not enter rubble, woods, jungle or bamboo.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;It may not push a wreck (<a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.42" class="topiclink">D10.42</a>).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;It may not assist in another vehicle's unbogging attempt (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">D8.3</a>).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Any ordnance attack vs it that misses by one renders its pontoons non functional, provided it is not HD to that attack and the colored dr of that TH DR is ≥ the white dr. Any non-ordnance attack (including Small Arms, but excepting mines and MOL) vs its Location whose Original IFT DR, plus all applicable TEM and Hindrance/SMOKE DRM, is ≤ the number in the ★ Vehicle line of the IFT column used for that attack renders its pontoons non-functional, provided the KA-MI is not HD to the attack (or is HD to none of the firers, for a FG attack). Non-functional pontoons are not automatically detached; they remain attached until a MP is expended to detach them in the normal manner. CC does not affect the pontoons. If the KA-MI is in an unfordable Water Obstacle when its pontoons become non-functional, it sinks (<a href="chd_chd16.htm#16.5" class="topiclink">D16.5</a>).</p>
<p>† If a KA-MI becomes a wreck, use the wreck side of a Type 95 HA-GO.</p>
<p>† RF is 1.5 for 1-10/44 and 1.6 thereafter. Availability vs other than U.S. is NA.</p>

Types 89A &amp; 89B CH1-RO Medium Tanks:</span> The Type 89, accepted for service in 1929 and built by Mitsubishi from 1931, was the first tank of Japanese design to be mass-produced. It was intended expressly for infantry support and first saw action during the 1932 &quot;Shanghai Incident&quot;, being used there by a SNLF unit. During production a wide variety of changes were made, including a revised front hull, redesigned turret, and (in 1936) the installation of an air-cooled diesel engine. With the new engine it was called the Type 89 OTSU (&quot;B&quot;), and the earlier, gasoline-powered version was then renamed the Type 89 KO (&quot;A&quot;). The 89B game piece represents the final model with all improvements. Allied wartime intelligence had several designations for the various models: M2589A, M2589B, Type 92, and Type 94 (M2594); however, the Japanese used none of these names. The Type 89 was employed mainly in China; however, the 7th Tank Regiment used them in the conquest of the Philippines and a small number reportedly participated in the overrunning of Malaya and Burma. Most Type 89 were withdrawn from service in/by 1943, but the 7th Independent Tank Company was still equipped with them in late 1944 when it fought against U.S. troops on Leyte. A platoon of Type 89 comprised three such AFV; a company, ten. <span class="f_Highlight">ERRATA:</span> The 57* AP Basic To Kill number is &quot;8&quot;.</p>

Types 97A &amp; 97B CHI-HA Medium Tanks:</span> By 1935 the latest European tanks and theories on armored warfare were proving the Type 89 CHI-RO obsolete, so the Japanese decided to produce a faster, more modern replacement. Two very different prototypes—the CHI-HA with a 12-cyl. air-cooled diesel engine, and the less-expensive but lighter and slower CHI-NI with a one-man turret—were built and tested; but when full-scale war broke out with China in 1937, the more sophisticated CHI-HA was immediately chosen. At that time the CHI-HA was probably the most technically advanced tank in production anywhere, in all respects save its gun. The Japanese belief that tanks were best used for infantry support had not yet been shattered, so no need was seen to give the CHI-HA a potent AT capability. However, with the possibility of future upgunning in mind, the designers made the — diameter of its turret ring as large as possible. This proved to be a wise decision, for after the Japanese experiences against masses of Russian tanks at Nomonhan in 1939, the CHI-HA's turret was redesigned to carry an adapted version of the Type 1 47mm AT gun. The Shinhoto (&quot;new turret&quot;) CHI-HA or CHI-HA Kai (&quot;Modified&quot;), as this model was variously known, entered series production in 1942 but, aside from two prototypes used on Corregidor in April of that year, was not encountered by the Western Allies until 1944. Besides equipping many tank companies, the Shinhoto CHI-HA was used by platoon/company commanders in tank regiments that retained the 57mm-armed CHI-HA. In addition, numbers of the 57mm version were fitted with the new turret and gun when sent back to Japan for repairs. Over 1,500 CHI-HA were built inclusive of both types—the vast majority by Mitsubishi. Three CHI-HA normally comprised a platoon (shotai), and ten a company (chutai). However, in the latter part of the war some tank regiments (sensha rental) reportedly contained platoons of four or even five CHI-HA in companies of up to seventeen tanks, and quite often the companies contained one or two additional HA-GO platoons. Allied wartime intelligence sometimes referred to the CHI-HA as the M2597 Medium; the Shinhoto CHI-HA was also called the Type 97 Improved by the Americans and the Type 97 Special by the British. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the piece names are our own designations.</p>

Afterwards the Japanese decided that the Type 97 Medium had to be uparmored as well as upgunned. This eventually resulted in the Type 1 CHI-HE, which also featured a new air-cooled diesel engine of greatly increased horsepower. 587 CHI-HE were built, all by Mitsubishi. The vast majority were issued to units stationed in Japan. However, a few, used as command tanks, are claimed to have been with the 2nd Tank Division on Luzon (though none were mentioned in subsequent U.S. evaluations of captured Japanese materiel). Since that division had been transferred there from Manchuria, it is possible that other CHI-HE saw action in China, and against the Russians in August of 1945.</p>
<p>In 1944-45 Mitsubishi also built sixty Type 3 CHI-NU Medium Tanks, which consisted of the CHI-HE with a much larger turret carrying a modified Type 90 75mm field gun. An attempt was made to send some to Okinawa but no shipping could be made available, so the CHI-NU ended the war in tank regiments stationed in Japan.</p>
<p>† Dates for use in China are 4-5/44 and 3-4/45 [EXC: vs Russians they are 8/45 only]. Vs U.S. on Luzon they are 1-6/45.</p>

It was actually a gasoline-powered &quot;armored railway tractor&quot; developed by the Corps of Railroad Engineers and used mainly for pulling small supply trains and patrolling the all-important rail lines in China. To increase its usefulness, the distance between the wheels on each axle could be altered so it could run on tracks of various gauges. In addition it was provided with four built-in jacks by means of which the crew could raise the vehicle high enough to place solid rubber tires over the hubs of its six railroad-type wheels, thus enabling it to leave the tracks and move cross-country. This operation was said to take ten minutes. Considering the Sumida's low power-to-weight ratio and very narrow tires, its &quot;off-rail&quot; mobility was probably quite poor except on very hard ground. One source states that over 1,000 were built (inclusive of all variants), beginning in 1933, for use by the IJA and the Manchurian Railways. Though not intended for frontline use, the Type 91 was employed in an offensive role on several occasions; however, it apparently saw little if any combat outside the Chinese mainland. Western sources usually refer to the Type 91 as the Type (or Model) 2593. When equipped with all optional MG, the game piece also represents several other armored cars such as the Hokoku ICHI-GO and Type 92 Naval (Hokoku SAN-GO) vehicles. These were similar to the Type 91 in game terms and theaters of operation, but were not designed for use on rails.</p>

See the accompanying diagram. No CA-change DRM apply to such fire [EXC: VCA-change&quot;DRM].</p>

<p>† The optional BMG has a RF of 1.5. That of the optional AAMG is 1.4.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-38 (1.3), 1939-42 (1.4), 1943-44 (1.5), and 1945 (1.6) [EXC: use vs Russians in 1938-39 is NA].</p>

Type 92 Armored Car:</span> This vehicle, not to be confused with the Type 92 Naval Armored Car mentioned in the previous Note, was used by the IJA. In the West it is usually referred to as the Osaka Armored Car. It apparently saw action only in very small numbers, and was probably little used outside China. (U.S. wartime intelligence does indicate that at least one was encountered by the Allies in Burma.) With the optional BMG the Type 92 also represents the Army's Aikoku Armored Car, which had on- and off-rail capabilities like the Type 91 Sumida AC.</p>
<p>Given the very primitive road net in most of eastern Asia and the generally mountainous terrain of China, armored cars were not held in much favor by the Japanese. They employed a half-dozen or so different types (including some imported from the British) but generally they relegated their armored cars to combat in urban areas. Aside from the Type 91 Sumida it seems that most were built in such small numbers they could hardly even be called production vehicles. For this reason, each of the Japanese armored car types in the game is somewhat genericized to represent several vehicles with characteristics similar to the one actually named.</p>
<p>† Reverse Movement costs this vehicle four times its normal hex entry cost—as signified by &quot;REV X 4&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† The optional BMG has a RF of 1.5.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for use in China are 1937-38 (1.5) and 1939-45 (1.6) [EXC: use vs Russians in 1938-39 is NA]. For use elsewhere they are 1941-5/45 (1.6).</p>

Type 1 Gun Tank HO-NI I:</span> This vehicle consisted of a CHI-HA chassis carrying a modified Type 90 75mm field gun. It was used in China (apparently by the 3rd Tank Division), and also saw combat with the 2nd Tank Division on Luzon. The HO-NI I could be employed as a self-propelled artillery piece (those on Luzon were part of the 2nd Mechanized Artillery Regiment), or as a combination tank destroyer and light assault gun (in which case a company of ten was included in a tank regiment). It is claimed that 124 were built, all by Hitachi. U.S. wartime intelligence referred to the HO-NI I as the Type 2 75mm SP Gun.</p>
<p>† Dates for use in China are 4-5/44 and 3-4/45. For use vs U.S. on Luzon they are 1-6/45. Availability is otherwise NA.</p>

Type 4 HO-RO Self-Propelled Howitzer:</span> This was a token attempt by the IJA to provide some form of mechanized heavy artillery. The HO-RO utilized the CHI-HA chassis, and was similar in appearance to the HO-NI I aside from mounting an obsolete Type 38 150mm howitzer (which was a licensed copy of a turn-of-the-century Krupp gun). A few HO-RO were encountered in 1945 by U.S. troops on Luzon. Some postwar sources have erroneously called this vehicle the Type 38 or Model 98.</p>
<p>† Availability is NA except vs U.S. on Luzon.</p>

It could also be used as an artillery prime mover. It was apparently first issued overseas at the beginning of 1944 when some were allotted to the 2nd Tank Division in Manchuria. A few months later that division was transferred to the Philippines, where afterwards some HO-KI were encountered by U.S. troops. Whether it was used there as an APC or prime mover remains unclear.</p>

It was developed in 1938 to replace the Type 94 4-ton YO-KE. The latter, which appeared in 1934, was quite similar to the SHI-KE aside from a different suspension. The two are equivalent in game terms, and this piece represents both.</p>

Type 92 I-KE 5-ton Tractor: </span>The Japanese produced a variety of unarmored, full-tracked prime movers for their medium and heavy artillery. The Type 92 I-KE, developed in 1932, had a water-cooled gasoline engine and was used for towing the 105mm field gun. About 1938 a new version with an air-cooled diesel engine entered production. This was designated the Type 92B and the original model was renamed the Type 92A. The game piece also represents two other prime movers whose characteristics are similar to those of the I-KE: the Type 92 NI-KU 8-ton tractor, which appeared in A and B versions like the I-KE but was used for towing the 150mm howitzer; and the 6-ton Type 98 RO-KE, which towed the 105mm howitzer, 105mm gun or 150mm howitzer.</p>

Type 95 Small Personnel-Vehicle: </span>This 4 X 4 car was the Japanese equivalent of the Jeep, and in fact predated the latter by about five years. It was also known as the &quot;Black Medal&quot;, and had an air-cooled V2 gasoline engine. About 4,800 (inclusive of several variants) were built by Kurogane between 1935 and 1940 when production ceased due to changing military priorities. After the war some were used by the French in Indo-China.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><img src="japnv027.jpg" width="351" height="82" alt="JapnV027" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">18. Type 94 &amp; Type 97 Trucks:</span> In 1925-27 Ford, Chrysler and GM set up manufacturing plants in Japan, and rapidly came to dominate that nation's domestic and military automotive scene. In fact, the IJA was forced to use quantities of American cars and trucks in its invasion of Manchuria in 1931. As the 1930s progressed, the Japanese government began the establishment of a strong domestic motor industry while at the same time passing a series of ever more restrictive laws regarding the production of foreign vehicles. As a result, by 1939 the U.S. manufacturers were forced out altogether and their facilities were taken over by the rapidly growing Japanese companies.</p>
<p>In 1931 the IJA purchased several British and Czech 6 x 4 trucks which it turned over to domestic firms with the order to study the basic designs and develop their own version. This led to the Isuzu Type 94, which became the most widely used tactical truck of the IJA. It was produced in two main versions: the 94A with a gasoline engine and the diesel-powered 94B. Both are equivalent in game terms. One variant of the Type 94 was used as an artillery prime mover.</p>
<p>The Type 97, also known as the Nissan 80, was a 4 x2 truck patterned after an American design. The game piece also represents its successor and militarized version, the Nissan 180, which continued in production after the war.</p>
<p>Japanese infantry only occasionally rode to war. The IJA never had a plentiful supply of trucks, and most of those it possessed were assigned to independent transport regiments which were generally reserved for logistics work.</p>
