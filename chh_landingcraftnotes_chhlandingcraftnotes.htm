Its wooden hull offered little protection beyond that provided by three armored transverse bulkheads. 2,193 LCP(L) were manufactured between 1940 and 1942. Following it in production was the LCP(R), which differed by having a narrow bow ramp (reportedly inspired by a photograph of a Japanese Daihatsu LC). 2,631 LCP(R) were built in 1942-43. The early-war U.S.M.C. designations for the LCP(L) and LCP(R) were T-Boat and TP-Boat, respectively. In U.S. service, LCP were usually transported aboard APD (high-speed destroyer-transports), APA (attack transports) and AKA (attack cargo ships).</p>
<p>The British received 500 LCP(L) and 600 LCP(R), the vast majority through Lend-Lease. However, 400 of the British LCP(L) comprised the initial production run which lacked the armored bulkheads and MG positions present in the later (U.S.) version. British LCP were generally transported aboard various types of LSI (Landing Ship, Infantry).</p>
<p>As fully armored LC became more widely available, most LCP(L) were relegated to use as command/guide boats.</p>
<p>† In British use the LCP(L) is considered completely unarmored and unarmed (but still has an Inherent crew). BPV for this version is &quot;8&quot;.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for British use are 5-12/40 (1.1), 1941 (1.0), 1942-6/43 (.9), 7/43-5/44 (1.2), and 6/44-5/45 (1.4) [EXC: PTO use is limited to Burma and 1944-45 (1.2)]. Dates and RF for U.S. use are 11/42-6/43 (.9) and 7-12/43 (1.0) [EXC: for PTO use they are 8/42-5/43 (.9) and 6-12/43 (1.0)].</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><img src="lancr005.jpg" width="175" height="79" alt="LanCr005" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. &nbsp;LCA:</span> The Landing Craft, Assault, was a British design that entered production in 1939. Constructed of wood covered over by armor plating, it became the standard infantry LC of British forces; 2,030 were built (including 50+ in India) before production ended in 1944. The original designation of ALC was changed to LCA in 1942. Although slower than the LCVP (its American counterpart), the LCA had better armor protection including a partial roof over the passenger compartment. Small numbers of LCA were used by U.S. troops (especially Rangers) in the North African, Mediterranean and European theaters from the time of Operation Torch through the Normandy assaults. One source states that 486 LCA were available to Allied forces for the Normandy landings, while another says the British had 448 and the U.S. 54.</p>
<p>† Contrary to <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.41" class="topiclink">G12.41</a>, the LCA may carry only Personnel/SW as Passengers despite its having a ramp. This is signified by &quot;Pers/SW only&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>† Each Indirect-Fire hit vs an LCA, as well as each attack vs an LCA which treats it as unarmored, has its Collateral-Attack FP halved (cumulative with all other applicable modifications, including the halving of FP specified in <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.672" class="topiclink">G12.672</a>).</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for British use are 5/40-5/45 and .9 [EXC: PTO use is limited to Burma and 1944-1/45 (.9)]. Dates and RF for U.S. use are 11/42-6/44 and 1.3 [EXC: PTO use is NA].</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="lancr006.jpg" width="174" height="79" alt="LanCr006" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. LCVP:</span> The original U.S. design for a LC capable of carrying a light vehicle was the LCV (Landing Craft, Vehicle), 2,366 of which were constructed in 1942. &nbsp;However, being both unarmed and unarmored, it was quickly succeeded by a much improved version, the Landing Craft, Vehicle Personnel. Both were of wooden construction (with armor plates added on the LCVP), and were built by Higgins of New Orleans. With 23,358 produced from 1942, the LCVP rapidly supplanted the LCV and LCP(L). 400 LCVP (and 300 LCV) were Lend-Leased to the British. 839 LCVP were available to the Allies for the Normandy landings. Many different ship types (e.g., APD, AKA, LST, LSD and LSV) were used to transport LCV and LCVP. Use of the LCVP in scenarios set prior to 6/43 actually represents the LCV.</p>
<p>† For use in a scenario set prior to 6/43, the LCVP is considered completely unarmored and unarmed (but still has an Inherent crew). BPV for this version is &quot;11&quot;.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for U.S. use are 11/42-6/43 (1.0) and 7/43-5/45 (.9) [EXC: for PTO use they are 8/42-5/43 (1.0) and 6/43-45 (.9)]. Dates and RF for British use are 11/42-6/43 (1.2) and 7/43-5/45 (1.3) [EXC: for PTO use in other than Burma they are 9/43-7/45 (.9); for Burma they are 1944-1/45 (1.3)].</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="lancr007.jpg" width="177" height="78" alt="LanCr007" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. LCM(3):</span> The Landing Craft, Mechanized (Mark 3), was one in a series of vessels whose concept originated with the British MLC(1), which was designed specifically to carry a light tank and entered production in 1939 (the designation was changed to LCM in 1942). Some 600 LCM(1) were built through 1944, and saw active service throughout the war. The LCM(2), an adaptation of a shallow-draft river tug, was built by Higgins of New Orleans—but only 147 of this mark were produced. Next came the LCM(3), also built (in the main) by Higgins but based on British ideas for carrying a medium tank. With 861 constructed in 1942-44, it was the most numerous version and saw widespread service. U.S. LCM were generally transported aboard APA, AKA and LSD. 650 LCM(3) were Lend-Leased to the British. In the Royal Navy, some LSI could carry one or two LCM, but a number of ships were converted to LCM carriers (designated LSS, LSC or LSG depending on the type of ship used). 358 LCM(3) and 128 LCM(1) were available to the Allies for the Normandy landings.</p>
<p>† For British use in a scenario set prior to 11/42, the LCM(3)'s Passenger capacity is &quot;49EE&quot;—and its two MG (see <a href="chh_landingcraftnotes_chhmultiapplcnotes.htm#b" class="topiclink">Note B</a>) are not 12.7mm, each has a FP of &quot;2&quot;, and the MA ROF is &quot;1&quot; (B12, as well as <a href="chh_landingcraftnotes_chhmultiapplcnotes.htm#b" class="topiclink">LC Notes B</a> and <a href="chh_landingcraftnotes_chhmultiapplcnotes.htm#c" class="topiclink">C</a>, still apply otherwise); BPV for this version is &quot;20&quot;. For U.S. use in a scenario set prior to 11/42, the LCM(3)'s Passenger capacity is &quot;49PP&quot;; BPV for this version is &quot;26&quot;.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for British use are 5/40-5/45 and 1.1 [EXC: for PTO use in other than Burma they are 9/43-7/45 (1.2); for Burma use they are 12/44-1/45 (1.1). Dates and RF for U.S. use are 11/42-6/43 (1.1) and 7/43-5/45 (1.0) [EXC: 8/42-45 and 1.0 for PTO use].</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="lancr008.jpg" width="177" height="78" alt="LanCr008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. LCI(S):</span> The Landing Craft, Infantry (Small), was designed and built in Britain, and was intended mainly for raiding operations. It was of wooden construction with a covering of armor plates. No more than a hundred (and perhaps as few as forty) were built, all in 1943. The hold of the LCI(S) was completely decked-over; passengers exited troop compartments to topside, then disembarked down four gangplanks pushed out over the bow as the vessel beached. LCI(S) carrying Royal Marines were in the forefront of the landings in Normandy and on Walcheren Island—unlike the much larger (and more common) LCI(L), which were generally not used in the initial waves if opposition was expected. 39 LCI(S) were available for the Normandy landings.</p>
<p>† The AAMG FP actually represents two 2-FP MG. This is signified by &quot;MG: 2&amp;2&quot; on the counter. Each has an eight-hex Normal Range and its own 360° field of fire. Each malfunctions, and is repaired or disabled, independently of the other. Scrounging may result in the creation of one or two British LMG as per <a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">D10.5</a>. For the 20L MA, see <a href="chh_landingcraftnotes_chhmultiapplcnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">Note E</a>.</p>
<p>† Passengers aboard the LCI(S) remain in a Cloaking Box even when their LC is Beached; when they expend MF to unload (see also <a href="chh_landingcraftnotes_chhmultiapplcnotes.htm#d" class="topiclink">Note D</a>), they appear onboard already unloaded (the reverse of this applies when they load). When an LCI(S) is Beached across a hexside that lies within its VCA, Passengers (un)load from/onto it across that hexside (despite its having no ramp).</p>
<p>† PTO use is NA.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="lancr010.jpg" width="166" height="74" alt="LanCr010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. LCT(4): </span>The Landing Craft, Tank (Mark 4) was, like its predecessors the Marks 1-3, designed and built by the British. Prior to early 1942 these craft were designated TLC. 865 LCT(4) were constructed in 1942-45, making it the second most numerous mark of LCT. It was the largest of all wartime LCT in terms of payload capacity, being able to carry six Churchill tanks or nine Shermans or 350 short tons of cargo. 768 standard LCT were available to the Allies for the Normandy landings, plus another 105 converted to specialist roles. For the Normandy invasion the British planned to land their specialized armor (Crabs, Crocodiles and AVRE) in LCT right at H-Hour—five minutes after DD tanks launched from other LCT were to have reached the shore, and seven minutes before the first infantry wave was to arrive.</p>
<p>Two types of U.S. LCT were used operationally during the war: the Mark 5 (500 built in 1942-43 of which 159 were Lend-Leased to the British), and the Mark 6 (964 built in 1943-44 with only two Lend-Leased to Britain). However, unlike the British, the Americans generally did not include LCT in the initial waves if they knew the landing would be opposed, preferring instead to use LCM carrying individual tanks.</p>
<p>LCT were capable of travel on the open sea, but had a fairly short range. Several could be carried fully laden in the hold of an LSD (Landing Ship, Dock). The LCT(5) was designed to be transported on the deck of an LST (Landing Ship, Tank), and was unloaded by listing the LST 11° which enabled the LCT to slide off into the water.</p>
<p>† For British use in a scenario set prior to 7/43, and for all U.S. use, the LCT(4)'s Passenger capacity is &quot;330PP&quot;. BPV for this version is &quot;82&quot;.</p>
<p>† Contrary to G12.421-.43, items in an LCT(4)'s Infantry Stack (G12.151) may unload despite the presence of any vehicle(s)/non-burning wreck(s) aboard it, provided its Vehicle Stack currently comprises &lt; 50% of its total Passenger capacity and, if that Vehicle Stack contains &gt; one vehicle/wreck, no wreck or Immobile vehicle is the topmost non-Gun ⅝&quot; counter in that Vehicle Stack. Any burning Passenger wreck aboard the LCT would still restrict (un)loading as per G12.44.</p>
<p>† Dates and RF for British use are 1941 (1.5), 1942-6/43 (1.3), and 7/43-5/45 (1.2) [EXC: for use in Burma they are 12/44-1/45 (1.3); for PTO use in other than Burma they are 5-7/45 (1.3)]. Dates and RF for U.S. use are 7/43-5/44 (1.4), 6/44 (1.3), and 7/44-5/45 (1.4) [EXC: for PTO use they are 1943-45 (1.5)].</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="lancr012.jpg" width="176" height="77" alt="LanCr012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. DAIHATSU:</span> Appearing in 1935 in response to a requirement of the Imperial Army, the Daihatsu was the world's first ramped landing craft. Its design was based on that of the traditional Japanese fishing boat. Several different versions, differing slightly in length, speed, armament and capacity, were ultimately built for the Army and Navy (hence the game piece is a generic version). Daihatsu were by far the most common type of Japanese LC, with apparently at least 5,000 built. Some were converted to river gunboats, particularly for use in China. U.S. Intelligence referred to the Daihatsu as the Type A landing craft. They were generally transported stacked on the decks of converted merchant ships, and set into the water by cargo booms.</p>
<p>† The AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within the Daihatsu's rear/port-side Target Facing.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="lancr013.jpg" width="175" height="78" alt="LanCr013" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. SHOHATSU:</span> This LC was a steel-hulled motor launch with a low armored shield across the front of the passenger compartment. U.S. Intelligence called it the Type B landing craft. Shohatsu were presumably carried to the landing site slung from the davits of troop transports.</p>
<p>† Shohatsu Passengers cannot be BU—as signified by &quot;PRC BU NA&quot; on the counter. Hence they are Vulnerable through their LC's front Target Facing in the same manner as any non-BU Passenger of an OT AFV (including use of the +2 CE DRM if otherwise applicable). <a href="chg_chg12.htm#12.124" class="topiclink">G12.124</a> applies unchanged, however.</p>
