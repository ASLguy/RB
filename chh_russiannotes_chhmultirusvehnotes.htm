<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A. </span>MA and CMG (if so equipped) have AA capability—signified by &quot;MA:AA&quot; being printed on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B.</span> &nbsp;Due to being in a fixed mount and fired remotely, this BMG receives a +1 DRM to all fire at a moving/Motion target. This penalty is signified on the counter by a white dot over the BMG factor.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C.</span> This AFV has no radio in scenarios set prior to 1943 (see <a href="chd_chd14.htm" class="topiclink">D14</a>). As of 1943 it is radio-equipped.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D.</span> Optional AAMG RF is 1.3. If available, optional RMG RF is 1.3.</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.  </span>MA may not fire at a same or lower level target through the VCA—as signified by &quot;MA: NA VCA&quot; being printed on the counter. If &quot;No Bnd(F)F&quot; appears on the counter, the vehicle may not use Bounding (First) Fire.</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G.</span> Optional AAMG is 12.7mm, with RF of 1.2.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><span class="f_Strong">H. </span>The Target Size To Hit DRM is +3 (and also HD) if in a Water Obstacle or deep/flooded stream hex.</p>
<p><a id="i"></a><span class="f_Strong">I.</span> Increase 1941 RF by .1 for each month after 7/41.</p>
<p><a id="j"></a><span class="f_Strong">J.</span> This AFV may possibly carry smoke dischargers (sD). Use rule <a href="chd_chd13.htm" class="topiclink">D13</a> [EXC: they are usable only once per scenario].</p>
<p><a id="k"></a><span class="f_Strong">K.</span> Uses red To Hit numbers despite its non-Russian manufacture.</p>
<p><a id="l"></a><span class="f_Strong">L.</span> Vehicle has Low Ground Pressure (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">D1.41</a>)—signified by its identity letter being inside a square. Moreover, when this vehicle is bogged, one (only) CX squad (even a Prisoner—but not a Guard) on foot expending ≥ four MF in the vehicle's Location (and declared to be assisting its unbogging) thereby allows the owning player to subtract 2 (1 per crew/HS) from the colored dr of its immediately subsequent unbogging DR.</p>
<p><a id="m"></a><span class="f_Strong">M.</span> Russian tracked AFV of the early war years had notoriously poor transmissions. Not only were they plagued by breakdowns, but were also extremely difficult to shift; in fact, many models carried as standard equipment a large hammer which the driver used on the shift lever to &quot;persuade&quot; it to move. Therefore, each time a Mechanical Reliability DR (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">D2.51</a>) is made for a Russian built AFV, an 11 result indicates that the AFV has stalled or suffered transmission difficulties that have prevented it from starting normally. Its owner must then immediately make another DR, which equals the total number of Delay MP (including one MP to stop, but excluding the MP expended to start) that the AFV has used in the unsuccessful attempt to move. It can again attempt to move, but must expend another MP to start—and must undergo another Mechanical Reliability DR as it does so. An AFV that stalls is subject to Defensive First Fire (since it has expended a MP to start), but not as a moving target unless it had already entered a new hex during the same MPh. Should a Stall result in more Delay MP being expended than the AFV has available, the AFV is considered to have expended its entire MP allotment in Delay.</p>
