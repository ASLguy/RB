<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 1941 the Soviet Union had a vast armored force of almost 30,000 AFV—more than the rest of the world combined. An obsession with annual production figures, however, upstaged the more mundane concern for the manufacture of spare parts. Consequently, when the Germans invaded, only about 7,000 of the 24,000 existing Soviet tanks could be considered completely battle-worthy. This in turn caused a large part of Soviet tank losses in the first months of Operation Barbarossa to be caused by mechanical breakdown. Several other important factors contributing to the poor showing of early Soviet armor were a general scarcity of radios, the inexperience of crews and commanders, and obsolete two-man turrets—all of which made Soviet tanks difficult to control as formations, and individually unwieldy in action. They were relatively &quot;blind&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; in combat—often blundering about oblivious to beneficial terrain and enemy positions; a situation which the Germans (and Finns) were quick to exploit. The result of all this was that by December 1941 the Soviets had lost all but about 4,500 tanks (of which some 2,100 were keeping watch on the Japanese) and their armored force was at its nadir.</p>
<p>In 1942, with better tanks beginning to predominate and with better training and tactics resulting from the experiences of 1941, the situation slowly improved and the gulf in tactical expertise between the Soviets and the Germans began to gradually diminish. Moreover, the Soviet philosophy of quantity before quality allowed them to outproduce the Germans, whose AFV were technically superior but also more expensive and time-consuming to build. Indeed, even with the loss of much of their natural resources and the forced relocation of many production facilities in 1941, the Soviets during the course of WW2 built some 102,000 AFV (of which about 71,000 were the superior T-34/KV/IS tanks) and could use sheer weight of numbers (as could the Western Allies) to help overpower the outnumbered invaders. Any counter errata mentioned in the Russian Vehicle and Ordnance Notes applies only to the 1st edition of BEYOND VALOR/RED BARRICADES.</p>

T-37:</span> A slightly altered version of the British Vickers A4E11. Used in recon units of infantry, cavalry, and mechanized formations. The game piece also represents the slightly different T-38 model. About 2,500 of all types were built.</p>

Only about 220 were built before production was halted in favor of the superior T-60.</p>

Only 63 were built, as they were found to be very cost-ineffective compared to the T-34. All were used in a single brigade on the Finnish front.</p>

T-60 M40 &amp; M42: </span>The T-60 was designed as a recon tank, but was nonetheless often pressed into service in support of infantry attacks since, due to attrition, by late 1941 recon tanks comprised roughly 50% of a tank brigade's strength. About 6,300 T-60 types were built. Beginning in 1943 many had their turrets removed and were used as gun tractors or SP rocket launchers. By the end of 1941, Soviet light tank platoons consisted of three vehicles each; prior to this each contained five tanks. M stands for model year in cases where significant variations existed.

T-70:</span> Another attempt to create the right combination of firepower, mobility, and protection in a light tank. However, by this time it was seen that the T-34 could do anything the T-70 could, and a lot more that the T-70 couldn't. So with ever increasing numbers of T-34 tanks obviating the need for light tanks, the T-70 was withdrawn from tank brigades in early 1944 (although it remained in use with other formations and Soviet allied forces). More than 8,200 T-70 were built. See also <a href="chh_russiannotes_chhmultirusvehnotes.htm#c" class="topiclink">Russian Vehicle Note C</a></p>

T-26 M33 &amp; T-26S M37/39:</span> The T-26 tanks were originally developed from the British Vickers 6-ton models, and for the most part equipped the tank battalions (22 T-26 and 16 recon tanks) of rifle divisions. Prior to the German invasion of Russia they were used in the Spanish Civil War (9/36-38), Manchuria (1939), and the Russo-Finnish War (1939-40). 88 were also sold to China around 1937. In 1941, T-26 and BT tanks formed 75% of the Soviet tank force. Over 12,000 T-26 were built, of which about 5,500 were Model 1933. The Models 1937 and 1939 had a more sloping turret and thicker armor. Optional CMG RF is 1.1.

The turret was designed to hold the 37mm Model 1932 L/46 gun but due to a shortage of guns the first tanks used only machine guns. Four versions of the turret were eventually developed: two MG-only versions (the BT-2B) and two 37mm versions, one with no MG and one with a CMG located 45 degrees clockwise from the gun. A total of 396 tanks were built. BT-2 tanks took part in the Polish and 1940 Finnish campaigns. Although withdrawn from front-line service by 1940, several were still in service in 1942-43 on the Leningrad front and in Karelia.</p>
<p>†The center hexspine of the CMG is always the next hexspine clockwise from the center hexspine of the current TCA; i.e., the CMG is located at the 2:00 position relative to the MA—as signified by &quot;2:00 from MA&quot; on the counter. The CMG is optional, with RF of 1.2; place a &quot;CMG Disabled&quot; counter if the CMG is absent.</p>
<p>†RF is 1.3 for 1939; 1.6 1940-43. &nbsp;[Errata: the picture should have a white oval behind the MP indicating it is fully tracked. &nbsp;The actual counter is correct.]</p>

BT-5 M34:</span> The BT (Bistrokhodny Tank: Fast Tank) were the basic AFV of independent tank brigades, and of mechanized and cavalry divisions. They were intended for use in the long-range exploitation role. Developed from the M1931 design of the American J.W. Christie, BT could be driven on their wheels, sans tracks—although this theoretical advantage was rarely used. BT were well-liked by their crews, but their thin armor made them vulnerable to even ATR. Prior to the German invasion of Russia, BT were used in the Spanish Civil War (about 50 were sent, 1937-1938), Manchuria (1938-39), and the Russo-Finnish War (1939-40). Almost 5,000 BT were built, up to and including the BT-5 series.</p>

BT-7 M37:</span> This series was an evolutionary modernization of the BT-5 with redesigned front armor, and with a new turret, more machineguns, and a new engine/drive train (without the wheels-only capability) being introduced in stages from 1935; the version equipped with both optional MGs is actually the BT-7M (aka BT-8). Unfortunately, such improvements did little to enhance the survivability of an obsolete design. Over 2,000 BT-7 types were built. The great significance of the BT design is that, via several experimental models, it was the direct predecessor of the T-34.

It was loosely based on the British A6E1 and had two MG-armed turrets flanking the driver. T-28 were used in Manchuria against the Japanese and in the Russo-Finnish War of 1939-40, as well as against the Germans. After 1938, most T-28 were consolidated into three heavy tank brigades, with each ideally containing 136 T-28, 47 BT, and 25 armored cars. About 600 T-28 types were built.</p>
<p>†BMG factor (2x2) is actually two 2 FP BMG: one in a starboard fore sub-turret and one in a port fore sub-turret. The starboard MG sub-turret may fire through the T-28's front Target Facing and starboard side Target Facing, and the port MG sub-turret may fire through the front Target Facing and port side Target Facing. No CA change DRM apply to such fire through a side Target Facing unless the AFV changes its VCA.

T-28E M40:</span> The original T-28 were found to be easily penetrated by Finnish AT guns and so were strengthened by adding additional plates. These uparmored versions successfully assisted in breaking through the Finnish Mannerheim Line in early 1940 but did not fare well against the Germans in 1941. T-28 production was ended in 1940 in view of the much superior T-34 design.</p>

Its combination of medium velocity 76mm gun, well-sloped armor, high top speed, and excellent mobility across soft ground, placed it a generation ahead of all other existing tanks. This is not to say, however, that it had no faults. It was extremely cramped and tiring to operate, its two-man turret reduced its rate of fire and overall fighting efficiency, and the early models were prone to breakdowns. Despite these problems, the T-34 was an excellent design overall and its appearance came as a rude shock to the Germans, who had until then been smug in the belief of their own technical superiority. 967 T-34 were with the western Military Districts on June 22, 1941.</p>
<p>In action, the T-34 proved to be almost invulnerable to the standard German tank and anti-tank guns. Initially though, the Soviet command dispersed them widely amongst the armored units and the vast majority of their crews had only a few hours of training, which often enabled the experienced German panzer crews to fully utilize their superior tactics to negate the T-34's superiority. On the other hand, the German infantry with their relatively immobile 37mm AT guns came to greatly fear the T-34, often being able to stop it only by attaching a grenade bundle or mine to its rear deck—not exactly a task they relished. The Model 1940 was the original production type; about 1,000 were built. See also <a href="chh_russiannotes_chhmultirusvehnotes.htm#m" class="topiclink">Russian Vehicle Note M</a></p>

T-34 M41:</span> This model was initially reserved for use by platoon and company commanders, but clamors from the front for its more effective gun led to its superseding the Model 1940 in production. The game piece also represents the Model 1942, which incorporated minor improvements. Soviet medium tank platoons generally consisted of three tanks apiece, with a company containing ten tanks.</p>

OT-34 &amp; KV-8:</span> Flamethrower tanks were generally organized into independent battalions attached to tank corps, with each battalion consisting of 10 KV-8 and 11 OT-34. Later these battalions had 20 OT-34 and 10 T-34.</p>

T-34 M43: </span>The addition of a roomier hexagonal-shaped turret and significant improvements in automotive reliability characterized the T-34 Model 1943, which was the most numerous version of the T-34/76 series. When production ceased in 1944, more than 35,000 T-34/76 had been built. †Decrease RF by .1 for each two-month period after 12/42 until .9 is reached in 9/43.</p>

T-43:</span> This was actually the prototype of an uparmored T-34 which never reached production, but for ease of identification its name is used here to identify those versions of the standard T-34 which were locally uparmored by welding additional plates to the hull front and turret. Most of these variants were produced in Leningrad and were therefore more commonly used in the areas around the Baltic Sea.

The resolution of this problem was the T-34/85, with a more powerful gun mounted in a new three-man turret. It first saw combat with the 1st Guards Tank Army. About 29,430 were built during WW2.</p>

Shipments of the M4A2/76(w) (which was the only 76mm version given to the Soviets) began in May 1944, and ultimately 2,095 were sent. Some tank and mechanized corps were entirely equipped with Shermans; the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps in 1945 was one such. The M4/76 may have a functioning gyrostabilizer (<a href="chd_chd11.htm#11.1" class="topiclink">D11.1</a>), and is also equipped with a 2in. smoke mortar (sM8; <a href="chd_chd13.htm" class="topiclink">D13</a>). The &quot;(a)&quot; in the piece name stands for American, for ESB purposes. Note that the M4/76 uses black To Hit numbers and U.S. AP/APCR TK#s. †RFis 1.5 in 1944.</p>

T-44: This was designed to replace the T-34/85, but the initial models failed to live up to expectations. About 200 were built by VE Day. Some saw limited action in 1945.</p>
<p><a id="21"></a><img src="russv048.jpg" width="171" height="75" alt="RussV048" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">21. T-35: </span>This was a &quot;land-battleship&quot; based on the design of the British Independent tank. While quite a dreadnought on paper, operationally its multitude of weapons could not be effectively directed by the overburdened tank commander; moreover, it was mechanically very unreliable. A total of about 60 were built. Some were used in Finland (1939), and most of those still running in 1940 were amalgamated into the elite 34th Tank Division, only to be subsequently lost in the frontier battles of 6/41—most to mechanical failures. A few participated in the defense of Moscow during late 1941. The high CS# is due more to the size of its crew (10 men) then to any intrinsic strength of the vehicle.</p>
<p><img src="russv050.jpg" width="353" height="243" alt="RussV050" style="border:none" />†The T-35 has four sub-turrets: two with a 45L gun (one each in the port aft sub-turret and the starboard fore sub-turret); and two with a 2 FP MG (one each in the port fore sub-turret and the starboard aft sub-turret). Each port sub-turret may fire at targets within the T-35's port side Target Facing, and each starboard sub-turret may do likewise within the T-35's starboard side Target Facing. Each fore sub-turret may fire at targets within the T-35's front Target Facing, and each aft sub-turret may do likewise within the T-35's rear Target Facing. Thus each sub-turret has a &quot;CA&quot; of either &quot;front and one side&quot; or &quot;rear and one side&quot; T-35 Target Facing, as per the diagram at the top of the next column. All ST penalties apply to the 76* gun.</p>
<p>Each 45L gun is always subject to the +1 BU DRM but does not suffer any TCA change DRM (although it must pay NT CA DRM if the T-35 changes &nbsp;its VGA); moreover, it may not use a multiple ROF nor may it use Intensive Fire.

KV-1 M39/40:</span> The KV (Klementi Voroshilov) caused great consternation amongst the Germans when they first encountered it. Barring a lucky track hit, it was almost totally invulnerable to all German guns save the 88s and large caliber artillery pieces. Its chief drawbacks were a poor turret layout and the fact that it was both extremely tiring to drive and unwieldy in action (the KV's turret had a three-man crew, but in game terms it suffers RST penalties because its turret configuration precluded the commander's being CE while the MA was being used). 508 KV were in service on June 22. 3,015 KV-1 types were built. Most Soviet independent tank battalions and brigades in the 1941-42 period contained a mixture of KV, T-34, and recon tanks. Soviet heavy tank platoons consisted of only two tanks each, with five tanks per company.</p>
<p>†The KVs' first major combat came with the German invasion, although a few KV-1 Model 1939 prototypes saw action near Summa, Finland, as early as 12/39 (RF 1.6 for pre-1941 use). See also <a href="chh_russiannotes_chhmultirusvehnotes.htm#m" class="topiclink">Russian Vehicle Note M</a></p>

KV-1E, KV-1 M41, &amp; KV-1 M42: </span>Uparmoring of the KV (Klim) was started even before Operation Barbarossa, based on faulty intelligence reports that the Germans were massively upgunning their tanks. Moreover, as new German weapons and ammunition were encountered, the Soviets introduced further modifications and retrofitted many of the surviving older KV with various types of applique armor. Each successive addition to their weight engendered a further loss of mobility however—and although the front lines were calling for faster tanks with thicker armor, the critical shortage of heavy tanks meant that the current models had to remain in production and could only be improved through expediencies. &nbsp;Due to their hampering of operations when used with the faster T-34, from 7/42 KV were placed in separate independent heavy tank regiments of 21 KV each.

KV-2:</span> The Dreadnought was designed as a &quot;bunker-buster&quot;, the need for which was discovered during the war against Finland in 1939. While it was an effective weapon versus static emplacements, its lumbering bulk was the complete opposite of what was needed during the mobile defensive battles of 1941, and it was quickly phased out of production. 334 were built.</p>
<p>†One prototype saw action in Finland in February 1940, around Summa.</p>
<p>†The KV-2's massive turret was difficult to traverse—especially if the tank was not on level ground. For this reason it is treated as a NT AFV [EXC: it may change its TCA but pays NT traverse DRM when doing so].

KV-1S:</span> By mid 1942 the number of Soviet tanks was again on the increase, and this luxury allowed the KV-1S to be introduced in order to increase the mobility of the heavy tank. In some ways it was a retrograde step, since its armor had to be drastically thinned; however, its new three-man turret freed the commander of his distracting need to also be the loader. 1,232 KV-1S were built.</p>

IS-2:</span> The IS (losef Stalin) heavy tank incorporated a re-designed KV hull and chassis combined with a new three-man turret. The first prototypes were built with an 85mm gun and then with a new 100mm gun, but the production versions had a 122mm gun chosen for its better HE capability and ease of production. This model is generally known as the JS-I in the West. IS tanks were initially used in independent heavy tank regiments, each of which contained 21 (5 per company; 2 per platoon).

IS-2m: </span>The main distinguishing characteristic of the IS-2m was its uniformly sloped upper hull front. Besides its above-mentioned use, by 1945 the IS also equipped the new independent heavy tank brigades (each containing 65 IS types). 3,854 IS-2 types were built between late 1943 and mid 1945. The IS-2m is generally known as the JS-2 in the West.

Its low, round, and extremely sloped turret was a revolutionary design, and its pointed hull front gave rise to its being nicknamed the &quot;Pike&quot;. The IS-3 was first issued at the time of the battle of Berlin. It is not definitely known if any saw combat; the Soviets claim they did. When first publicly displayed in September 1945 they caused great concern to Western observers and significantly influenced post-war Western designs.

The increasing effectiveness of German armor and guns soon relegated it to the infantry support role, however, where it saw widespread use. It was initially used in conjunction with the SU-122 on the Volkhov Front in the attempt to relieve Leningrad. To ease logistics, in mid 1943 the SU-76 were placed in their own light SPA regiments of 21 vehicles each (with each battery comprised of four vehicles). 12,671 SU-76 and ZSU-37 AA vehicles were built between 1942 and mid 1945.

SU-76i(g):</span> This used the hull and chassis of a captured PzKpfw III or StuG III, on which was fabricated a sloping box superstructure mounting a 76mm gun. 190 were built in 1943. They were generally used like the SU-76M. The sole surviving example (converted from a PzKpfw III J) was found in the Ukraine in 1972, lying at the bottom of the Sluch River where it had fallen through thin ice in January 1944 during the 143rd Rifle Division's attack on Sarny.

ISU-122 &amp; ISU-152:</span> These were continuations of the SU-152 concept, but using the IS chassis. In action, the greater armor piercing capability and longer range of the 122mm gun were complemented by the 152mm's better HE performance. They were used almost exclusively for direct fire, in the second wave of tank attacks. Their greatest liability was their ammunition capacity, which was only 30 and 20 rounds respectively. The ISU-122 and 152 were used in heavy SPA regiments (as per the SU-152), and after 1944 also in Guards heavy SPA brigades (as per the SU-100). From latter 1943 to mid 1945 a total of 4,075 of both types were built. See also <a href="chh_russiannotes_chhmultirusvehnotes.htm#g" class="topiclink">Russian Vehicle Note G</a></p>

Used in tank destroyer battalions of 16 vehicles each (21 from 1944), it first saw combat during the forcing of the Dnepr River. With the advent of the T-34/85, the gun of the SU-85 became redundant and it was eventually superseded in production by the SU-100. 2,050 SU-85 were built.</p>

On the other hand, the Lend-Lease types probably had problems in the severe Russian winters (as western vehicles do in the Soviet Union to this day). U.S. trucks contributed vitally to the motorization of the Red Army, and became so common in certain areas that the locals sometimes thought the &quot;USA&quot; stencilled on them stood for &quot;Ubiyat Sukinsyna Adolf (&quot;kill that sonofabitch Adolf&quot;).</p>

<p>The United States supplied the Soviet Union with some $9 billion worth of goods and materials during World War II. Included in this were some 7,200 tanks (of which 6,300 arrived), over 432,500 trucks, and just over 14,000 aircraft. Great Britain and Canada supplied the U.S.S.R. with about 5,200 tanks (of which some 4,600 arrived), 4,000 planes, over 2,500 Carriers, and several types of trucks. The Soviets generally belittled the AFV of the Western Allies and relegated many to secondary fronts, thus releasing their own AFV for use in more important areas at a time when Soviet AFV production was still recovering from the setbacks of 1941. More recent reports of Soviet tactical doctrine indicates that Russian policy was to operate 'Western' tanks on their southern fronts where winter conditions were not so harsh. On the other hand, the great influx of trucks and other transport vehicles gave Soviet units a degree of mobility that could not have been attained had they been solely dependent on their own domestic truck production, which out of necessity had to be greatly curtailed to allow increased AFV production. In sum, while the Soviets have minimized the effects of Lend-Lease on their ability to defeat Germany, it is fair to say that in this regard it was not decisive but was certainly significant.</p>
<p>For DYO purposes use British counters to represent the following vehicles in Soviet service. All pertinent Vehicle Notes apply normally. As a rule of thumb, keep in mind that generally only one type of Lend-Lease tank was used in a Soviet tank brigade or regiment - although often in conjunction with Soviet light or medium tanks. Note also that since the Soviets have been largely reticent concerning their use of Lend-Lease vehicles, the Dates given below are in many cases estimates based on shipping and/or delivery dates.</p>
