M2 60mm Mortar:</span> This light mortar was a license-built version of the French Brandt 60mm mortar, and was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1940. About 75,000 were made. An Army rifle company had three in the mortar section of its weapons platoon. A mechanized cavalry recon troop had nine (three per platoon; see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#54" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 54</a>). Each armored infantry platoon had one (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#28" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Notes 28</a> and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#29" class="topiclink">29</a>). Each parachute infantry platoon had one, as did each glider infantry platoon until 8/44. The glider infantry company also had 2-4 more (depending on the date) in its weapons platoon. A Marine rifle company had two (officially increased to three in April 1943—although many companies apparently did not receive the third one until much later). In May 1944 four were also authorized in each Marine infantry battalion HQ company. A Marine Raider company had three 60mm mortars.</p>
<p>†The M2 had a longer range than most light mortars because its primary role was not as a &quot;direct support&quot; weapon for the platoon/company, but rather as the company's on-call &quot;OBA&quot;. Therefore, for every three M2 mortars the U.S. player receives in his OB, he may exchange those three for a radio (or field phone) and a 4 FP OBA battery that can fire only HE (and WP in 1945) Concentrations/IR. This battery receives the -2 Radio Contact Maintenance DRM of <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.22" class="topiclink">C1.22</a>, and uses the standard U.S. Battery Access draw pile [EXC: if the U.S. force is suffering from Ammo Shortage, this battery has Scarce ammo]. When used as OBA, the M2 is treated as having a maximum range of 40 hexes, which is counted from the center road hex of the U.S. player's Friendly Board Edge (i.e., as per <a href="chb_chb11.htm#11.42" class="topiclink">B11.42</a>). An AR/SR/FFE counter of this OBA cannot be placed/ Corrected beyond this range of 40 hexes, and any direction/extent of error dr that would place such a counter beyond this range is void and must be rerolled. If the U.S. force has no Friendly Board Edge, this OBA option cannot be used.</p>

M19 60mm Mortar:</span> Also known as the T18E6, this was a lighter, simplified version of the M2. Only a small number were made, and were issued to a few airborne and special purpose units. The M19 used the same tube as the M2, but had a much smaller baseplate and no bipod. It also differed from the M2 by being trigger-fired.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="amero008.jpg" width="165" height="77" alt="AmerO008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. M1 81mm Mortar:</span> This weapon, a copy of the classic French Brandt 81mm mortar, was the standard battalion mortar in U.S. service. It fired both light (7-lb.) and heavy (10¾-lb.) HE bombs, as well as WP. About 30,000 were made during the war. Its primary use was in the heavy weapons company of the infantry battalion, whose mortar platoon contained three sections of two mortars each. (Parachute mortar platoons had only two sections—and airborne 81mm mortar platoons were located in the infantry battalion's HQ company.) A mechanized cavalry recon squadron had three 81mm mortars, as did a TD battalion (SP). The weapons company of a Marine battalion contained a platoon of four 81 mm mortars until April 1944 (after which date the platoon was moved to the battalion's HQ company), while the HQ company of a Marine Raider regiment had eight.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="amero010.jpg" width="166" height="74" alt="AmerO010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. M2 4.2-in. Mortar:</span> This weapon was designed by the Chemical Warfare Service, and some 8,500 were built. The 4.2-in. (or &quot;Goon Gun&quot;, as it was sometimes called) had been intended to fire only gas and SMOKE rounds; however, an HE round was also designed in time for the mortar's combat debut in Sicily. In action it was found that the higher ROF used when firing HE increased the incidence of malfunctions. The normal Smoke rounds appear to have been used rarely, if at all, in combat. Unlike the vast majority of mortars whose barrels are smoothbore, the 4.2-in. was unusual in having a rifled barrel. This feature increased its accuracy, but at the cost of making it (and its projectiles) more expensive and time-consuming to manufacture. The 4.2-in. was used only in chemical mortar battalions, which were attached at army/corps level. A platoon comprised four weapons.</p>
<p>†This MTR fired an exceptionally potent round for its caliber; therefore its Area Target FP is &quot;12&quot; (rather than &quot;8&quot;). This is signified by &quot;12 Area FP&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p>†RF in the ETO is as follows: 1.4 for 7/43-5/44; 1.3 for 6/44-2/45; and 1.2 for 3-5/45. PTO Dates and RF are 8/43-45 and 1.4.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="amero012.jpg" width="167" height="76" alt="AmerO012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. &nbsp;T25 155mm Mortar:</span> This weapon was designed to give heavy and immediate fire support to amphibious landings and jungle troops in locales not suited to conventional artillery. To be moved, it had to be disassembled; the tube and recoil mechanism were loaded aboard a special handcart, while a second cart carried the bipod and baseplate. Other carts transported the ammo, with six rounds on each. Combat trials were conducted in the SW Pacific in 1944, whereupon it was decided that the extra weight of the T25 and its ammunition negated the value of its larger round, so it was withdrawn from service. Only 244 were built. †This mortar is carried on a vehicle that has a T# ≤ its M# (like a 76-107mm MTR; <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>), rather than towed by it—as signified by &quot;Tow NA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="amero014.jpg" width="168" height="72" alt="AmerO014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. M3A1 37mm AT Gun:</span> Development of the first purpose-built U.S. anti-tank gun started in 1937, and was based on the German PaK 35/36. Unlike most AT guns, the M3A1 had a manual breech block which lowered its rate of fire. It was used in combat in North Africa but was then gradually replaced in the ETO by the 57mm gun. In the PTO, however, it remained in use throughout the war, being quite adequate to deal with the lightly-armored Japanese AFV, and having a canister round that proved invaluable for stopping massed infantry attacks. 18,702 were built. It was usually towed by a Jeep or ¾-ton truck. In the 1941-43 period it was found in the Army infantry battalion's HQ company, the infantry regiment's AT company, the armored infantry company (with one gun per armored infantry platoon and one in the company HQ, towed by an M2 Halftrack), the HQ company of an armored infantry regiment, the armored division's HQ company and armored recon battalion, and the glider infantry regiment. A platoon comprised four guns. In addition, the 10th Mountain Division in Italy was authorized three 37mm AT guns per infantry battalion. A Marine division had three four-gun 37mm AT platoons in each infantry regiment's weapons company, and also had (from April 1943 through 1944) three six-gun platoons in its Special Weapons battalion.</p>
<p>A Marine Raider regiment had four 37mm AT guns. The Philippine Army also used the 37mm AT gun in 1941-42.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in North Africa and the ETO are 11/42-5/45; RF for such use is .9 for 11/42-6/43, 1.2 for 7-12/43, and 1.4 thereafter. PTO RF is 1.0.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="amero016.jpg" width="167" height="77" alt="AmerO016" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. &nbsp;M1 57mm AT Gun:</span> By 1941 the Army had realized that its &nbsp;37mm AT gun was rapidly becoming obsolete. Since it might take several years to design and develop a new gun, the British 6-pounder was copied, with minor alterations made for American preferences and production methods. Some 16,000 of the M1 were built, and from mid 1943 it gradually replaced the 37mm M3A1 in the ETO. In mid 1943 the Army also reorganized its infantry divisions; subsequently the 57mm could be found in the division's HQ company, as well as in the infantry battalion HQ company's AT platoon and the infantry regiment's AT company (first appearing in the latter company, and only later in the battalion AT platoon). Each armored infantry company had one platoon (towed by M2 halftracks), as did the armored division's HQ company. In an airborne division AT guns were found in the glider infantry regiment, the glider infantry battalions (in 1945), the Airborne AA battalion, and the artillery battalions. A platoon comprised three guns (four in certain airborne applications) which were often towed by Jeeps. Unlike most British, Soviet, and German divisions, a U.S. Army division had no organic AT battalion— divisional AT assets being in the form of one or more attached TD battalions. Exceptions to this were the 10th Mountain Division in Italy with its AT battalion of 18 57mm guns, and the airborne divisions which each had a combined AA/AT battalion.</p>
<p>Contrary to what has been previously published, the M1 did fire other types of ammunition besides AP. Limited supplies of British HE and APDS became available in the summer of 1944, and the U.S. T18 HE round was being issued by early 1945. A canister round was also developed—but if used in combat it was issued only in small amounts in late 1944.</p>
<p>†HE with a Depletion number of &quot;7&quot;, and APDS with a Depletion number of &quot;4&quot;, are available in the ETO as of June 1944. HE7 becomes available in the PTO in 1945. These restrictions are signified on the counter by the superscripts &quot;J&quot; (for June) and &quot;E&quot; (for ETO).</p>
<p>†Dates for use in the ETO and PTO are 7/43-5/45 and 44-45 respectively. Decrease ETO RF by .1 for each two-month period after 8/43, until 1.0 is reached in 1/44. PTO RF is 1.2.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><img src="amero018.jpg" width="168" height="76" alt="AmerO018" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. M5 3-in. AT Gun: </span>While the M1 57mm AT gun was being developed in 1941, the Army also decided to start work on a more powerful weapon. To bring it into production as quickly as possible, the designers used the barrel of the 3-in. (76mm) AA gun and the carriage, breech, and recoil mechanisms of the 105mm howitzer. The result was rather large and heavy for an AT gun (its weight in action was almost twice that of the German 7.5cm PaK 40), but it worked better than might have been expected from such an improvisation. However, while the M3 3-in. AA gun and the M7 3-in. gun of the M10 GMC had semiautomatic breech blocks, the M5 had a manual breech block which lowered its rate of fire. 2,500 were built before production ended in 1944. The M5 was not used as a divisional AT gun but rather in tank destroyer battalions (towed), with four guns (each towed by an M3 halftrack) per platoon. In early 1945 most towed battalions were converted to SP, making the towed gun relatively rare in the last few months of the war. Since the M5 3-in. was used solely in towed TD battalions it was sometimes referred to as a tank destroyer instead of an AT gun. Apparently it was not used in the PTO.</p>
<p>†APCR is not available in Italy.</p>
<p>†RF for use in the ETO (other than Italy) is 1.3 for 6-8/44, 1.2 for 9/44-2/45, and 1.4 for 3-5/45. Dates and RF for use in Italy are 11/44-5/45 and 1.4.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="amero020.jpg" width="127" height="57" alt="AmerO020" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. T32 37mm Manpack Gun:</span> The canister-firing 37mm AT gun was highly valued in the jungle fighting that was common in the PTO, but was difficult to manhandle forward in such terrain. Therefore in late 1943 work began on a light gun that could be completely dismantled and backpacked by its crew or by mule. When assembled, the barrel and recoil mechanism were mounted on a modified .50-cal MG tripod, and the gun's weight in action was 264-lbs. It fired the same HE ammo as the 37mm AT gun as well as a specially developed canister round. 155 were sent to the PTO in 1944 (possibly at the same time as the T25 155mm MTR), and about 100 others were used in Italy in 1945.</p>
<p>†Due to the T32's rarity and unusual design it is treated as a crewed weapon; see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamiordnotes.htm#d" class="topiclink">U.S. Ordnance Note D</a>. In addition, the T32 may be moved (or advanced) into/through, and fired from, all terrain types allowed to a HMG (e.g., an upper building level). As a SW, the T32 incurs no CA-change DRM penalty (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">C9.2</a>), but is subject to the woods/building CA restrictions of <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">A9.21</a>. The T32 has no Gunshield, and its portage cost while dm is 3 PP.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in Italy are 3-5/45.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="amero022.jpg" width="130" height="58" alt="AmerO022" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. M18 57mm Recoilless Rifle: </span>Although the first patent for a recoilless gun was granted to an American in 1898, serious work on turning the principle into a viable weapon did not begin in the U.S. until June 1943. The Infantry Section of the Army's R&amp;D Service designed a 57mm piece based on principles gleaned from British RCL experiments, while the Artillery Section produced a weapon based on the German 105mm RCL. The 57mm was test-fired in October 1943 and the Army decided to give it priority over the 105 since its light weight would enable it to be easily carried through jungle or broken terrain. Under the designation T15, 100 were ordered in the spring of 1944 for combat trials. Fifty were sent to the ETO in early 1945 and were first used by the 17th Airborne Division near Essen. Some were also used on Okinawa. The T15 weighed 44-lbs. and could be fired from either the shoulder, its attached bipod, or a modified .30-cal MG tripod. It was standardized as the M18 in June 1945. Development of a canister round was initiated, but was unsatisfactory and apparently was cancelled without undergoing combat trials.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><img src="amero024.jpg" width="128" height="59" alt="AmerO024" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. M20 75mm Recoilless Rifle:</span> This was basically an enlarged version of the 57mm gun. Its weight of 115-lbs. relegated it to almost always being fired from its modified .30-cal MG tripod. The first production order for the T21E4 was placed in October 1944, and combat trials took place alongside the 57mm RCL. It was standardized as the M20 in June 1945. Both U.S. RCL were known as &quot;Kromuskits&quot;, which is an amalgamation of the original designers' names.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><img src="amero026.jpg" width="169" height="73" alt="AmerO026" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">12. M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer:</span> This weapon was originally developed in the 1920s as a mountain gun able to be disassembled and carried by pack mules. Later a new carriage with pneumatic tires was introduced, thus making the gun able to be towed at higher speeds by a motorized vehicle (usually a Jeep) as well as enabling it to be dropped by parachute. In the latter role it was broken down into nine loads, which in 1944-45 were held together by a harness during their descent. (Prior to 1944 no harness was used, causing a wide dispersion of the gun's components and resulting in an average assembly time of half an hour in daylight or one hour at night.) The 75mm pack howitzer was used in action by field artillery battalions of Marine divisions (officially deleted in May 1945), airborne divisions, and the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. It was also used by several nondivisional artillery battalions in Europe, the Pacific islands, and Burma/China. Some also equipped regimental cannon companies in the PTO. Allied troops who used it included British airborne and Chinese artillery units, and Yugoslav partisans. In U.S. service a pack howitzer battery comprised four such weapons.</p>
<p>†For 1944-45 DYO scenarios the gun is represented by a ½&quot; parachute when being air-dropped, and is considered reassembled only if its manning Infantry have spent one complete Game Turn TI in the same Location with it.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in other than the PTO are 7/43-5/45 and 1.3. PTO RF is 1.5 through 7/42, and 1.1 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><img src="amero028.jpg" width="169" height="75" alt="AmerO028" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13. M1897A2 75mm Gun:</span> The M1897A2 was the famed &quot;French 75&quot;—the world's first modern field piece—as altered and built in the U.S.A. after WW1. Although being phased out of active service in 1941, it did see combat in the Philippines with elements of the 23rd, 24th, and 88th Field Artillery Regiments (and probably also with the Philippine Army), and on Java with the 2nd Battalion of the 131st Field Artillery Regiment. The remaining guns were used for training, for arming various allies, and as the armament of the M3 GMC. 4,236 of the M1897A2 were built.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><img src="amero030.jpg" width="169" height="73" alt="AmerO030" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />14. M2A1 105mm Howitzer: As the standard divisional light artillery piece, the M2A1 was used in the field artillery battalions of Marine, cavalry, and infantry divisions, and also in nondivisional field artillery battalions. A battery consisted of four howitzers, each towed by a 2½-ton truck. 8,536 were built by the end of the war. 13 different types of ammunition were developed for it. The M2A1 was an excellent howitzer and in various modified forms is still in service with over forty countries, including the U.S. where it is designated the M101A1.</p>
<p>†ETO Dates and RF are 11/42-5/45 and 1.0. PTO Dates are 8/42-45, with ROF of 1.2 for 8-10/42 and 1.0 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><img src="amero032.jpg" width="167" height="75" alt="AmerO032" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">15. M3 105mm Howitzer:</span> In 1941 a requirement was &nbsp;issued for an air-transportable 105mm howitzer. &nbsp;The weapon designed to meet this requirement used the M2A1 howitzer's barrel (shortened by 27 inches), the carriage from the cavalry version of the 75mm pack howitzer, and a modified version of the pack howitzer's recoil mechanism. The result worked suprisingly well (although its maximum range was much less than M2A1's). Its primary employment was with the infantry regiment, which as of July 1943 was authorized a cannon company of six M3 howitzers (each towed by a ¾-ton truck). Several glider field artillery battalions (e.g., the 319th, 320th, and 907th) also used the M3 in 1944-45; one glider would bring in the howitzer and its ammo, while another would land its crew with the Jeep used to tow it. (A few sources state that all glider field artillery battalions used the M3, but others say that some retained the pack 75.) While the M3 could be classified as an INF Gun, it was used in the indirect fire role more than its German 75 and 150mm counterparts, and had no gunshield, so has been classed as an ART Type.</p>
<p>†Decrease ETO RF by . 1 for each month after 9/43, until 1.0 is reached in 1/44. PTO Dates and RF are 1944-45 and 1.2.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><img src="amero034.jpg" width="166" height="77" alt="AmerO034" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">16. &nbsp;M1 4.5-in. Gun:</span> In 1939 the Army decided to design a new 4.7-in. (120mm) gun. It was then suggested that the caliber be changed to 4.5-in. (114mm) so as to allow interchangeability of ammunition with the British gun of the same caliber. The M1 was the result. Its British-designed ammunition had a low HE content for its caliber, which made it less effective than desired; for this reason, and its excellent range notwithstanding, the 4.5-in. was declared obsolete the day atfer VE Day. 426 were built, but only about 200 saw combat in sixteen medium field artillery battalions—all in the ETO. A battery of 4.5-in. guns comprised four such weapons.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in Italy are 10/43-9/44 and 1.6. Dates for use elsewhere in the ETO are 6/44-5/45, with RF of 1.6 through 9/44, and 1.5 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><img src="amero036.jpg" width="166" height="72" alt="AmerO036" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">17. M1918 155mm Howitzer:</span> In June 1940, 2,791 M1917 (the French C17S) and M1918 (its U.S.-built version) howitzers were in service, of which 599 had pneumatic tires for vehicular towing. The M1918 saw action in the PTO (initially with the 86th Field Artillery Regiment in the Philippines and possibly with the 26th Field Artillery Brigade on Java), North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. It was also used at one time or another during the war by the Chinese, British, Free French, and South Africans.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy are 11/42-5/45; RF for this use is 1.2 through 10/43 and 1.4 thereafter. PTO Dates are 41-45, with 1.3 RF through 1943 and 1.4 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><img src="amero038.jpg" width="165" height="75" alt="AmerO038" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">18. M1 155mm Howitzer:</span> Production of the M1 was slow in getting underway; by the end of 1942 only 33 had been completed. 4,035 were eventually built during the war, during which time it gained a reputation for both reliability and accuracy. Slightly modified after the war, it is still used in almost 30 countries, including the U.S. where it is designated the M114A1. The 155mm howitzer was most commonly used as a companion piece to the 105mm howitzer in divisional artillery, with one 155mm medium field artillery battalion (three batteries of four howitzers each) per infantry division; &quot;One-five-fives&quot; also equipped nondivisional medium artillery battalions. Marine divisions were authorized a battalion of 155mm howitzers in May 1945.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in other than the PTO are 7/43-5/45; RF for such use is 1.5 through 8/43, 1.4 for 9-10/43, and 1.2 thereafter. PTO Dates and RF are 44-45 and 1.3 [EXC: for use with the Marines they are 2-6/45 and 1.5].</p>

M1918M1 155mm Gun:</span> The M1918M1 was a U.S.-built version of the French &quot;Canon de 155 GPF&quot;. 641 of the M1918M1 were produced, while 48 of the M1917 model had been purchased. Some saw combat in the Philippines and several other Pacific actions, mostly with coast artillery battalions providing long range artillery support. They were also used in Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy before being replaced by the newer M1A1 model. Some M1918M1 were used as the MA of the M12 GMC, others were Lend-Leased, and the remainder were used for training.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy are 1943 and 1.5, while for use in the PTO they are 41-44 and 1.6.</p>

By the end of 1941 only 65 had been built. Prior to 1944 the M1A1 was produced, which incorporated an improved breech ring. Both types (and the M1918M1 models) were used in nondivisional heavy field artillery battalions which comprised three four-gun batteries, and also in eight-gun coast artillery battalions that were used as heavy artillery throughout the island campaigns in the Pacific. The M1 and M1A1 guns became standard U.S. heavy artillery weapons during WW2, and an improved M2 version remained in both U.S. and British service until the 1950s. The normal time required to completely unlimber the M1A1 was 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in the ETO are 8/43-5/45, with 1.5 for 8/43-6/44, 1.4 for 7/44-1/45, and 1.3 for 2-5/45. PTO Dates and RF are 5/43-45 and 1.5.</p>

Howitzer:</span> This howitzer first saw combat in late 1943 with the 932nd and 935th Field Artillery Battalions in Italy, while its debut in the PTO was in New Guinea with the 465th Field Artillery Battalion. It was not used by the Marines. By 1945 1,006 M1 8-in. howitzers had been built, and had acquired the reputation of being the war's most accurate long range artillery pieces. An 8-in. howitzer battery consisted of four such weapons. In its towed version the 8-in. was redesignated the M115 after the war and still serves in the armies of several nations. The normal time to completely unlimber the M1 was 30-60 minutes.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in Italy are 11/43-7/44 (RF 1.5), 8-10/44 (RF 1.6), and 3-5/45 (RF 1.5). Dates and RF for use elsewhere in the ETO are 7/44-1/45 (RF 1.5) and 2-5/45 (RF 1.4). PTO Dates and RF are 9/44-45 and 1.6.</p>

In both cases the weapons system was usually referred to as the Maxson, after its manufacturer. A lighter air-transportable version was also developed; designated the M55, it could be towed by a Jeep.</p>

It compared unfavorably with the 40mm AA gun in several respects but, since production of the latter could not meet demands, the M1A2 continued to be built. 7,278 were manufactured and the gun saw service in all theaters throughout the war. It was also employed as the MA of the M15 and M15A1 MGMC halftracks. The Army used the M1A2 in four-gun batteries in both Mobile and Semimobile AAA [Anti-Aircraft Artillery] Automatic Weapons battalions, and in Coast Artillery (AA) regiments. The Marines used four-gun M1A2 platoons in AAA battalions, Defense battalions, and divisional Special Weapons battalions.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in North Africa and the ETO are 11/42-5/45, with RF of 1.3 through 3/44, 1.4 for 4-12/44, and 1.5 in 1945. RF for use in the PTO is 1.3 through 5/44, and 1.4 thereafter.</p>

M1 40mm AA Gun:</span> This is the famous Bofors, which was the most widely used AA gun of the Second World War. 34,116 were built in the U.S. during WW2, and they served in all theaters in most of the same types of units as the M1A2. A light-weight, air-transportable version known as the M5, which when disassembled could be carried in a C-47, was also built; although originally intended as an Airborne weapon it was mainly used in the PTO—presumably by the 101st, 102nd, and 843rd AAA Automatic Weapons Battalions (Air-Transportable). Eighteen U.S. Bofors were field-mounted on M3 halftracks by the 209th AAA Automatic Weapons Battalion (SP), and in 1945 were used by that unit in the ground support role on Luzon.</p>
<p>†Dates for use in the ETO (other than Italy) are 6/44-5/45, with RF of 1.3 for 6-9/44 and 1.2 thereafter. Dates for use in Italy are 9/43-1/45, with RF of 1.4 for 9/43-3/44, 1.3 for 4-10/44, 1.4 for 11-12/44, and 1.5 for 1/45. Dates for use in the PTO are 11/43-45, with RF of 1.5 through 5/44 and 1.3 thereafter.</p>

AA Gun:</span> There were two distinct types of 3-in. AA guns: a mobile version (which the game piece represents), and a static gun that was used in permanent defenses. About 800 were built. By 1941 most had been relegated to training roles, but some equipped Coast Artillery (AA) regiments and Marine Defense battalions in the PTO where they saw combat during the initial Japanese attacks (e.g., on Guam, Wake Island, and in the Philippines). AP ammunition was not issued to the static guns. One interesting fact concerning all Army AA units is that prior to March 1942 they were part of the Coast Artillery; hence they had Coast Artillery designations until inactivated or renamed later in the war. A 3-in. AA battery comprised four guns.</p>
<p><a id="26"></a><img src="amero054.jpg" width="165" height="75" alt="AmerO054" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">26. M1A1 90mm AA Gun:</span> In 1940 the Ml 90mm AA gun, which after slight modification became the M1A1, entered production. By the end of 1942 more than 2,000 90mm AA guns had been built, and they saw service in all theaters. Two deficiencies of the 3-in. AA gun which were not corrected in the 90mm piece were the amount of time required for unlimbering and the inability to depress the gun barrel to fire on targets at lower elevations. This was due to their having been designed solely for AA fire, with little consideration given to use against ground targets.</p>
<p>†ETO RF is 1.5 until 1944 when it becomes 1.4. PTO RF is 1.6 until 1944 when it becomes 1.5.</p>
<p><a id="27"></a><img src="amero056.jpg" width="167" height="73" alt="AmerO056" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">27. &nbsp;M2 90mm AA Gun:</span> Even as the M1A1 gun was entering production it was decided that AA guns should be able to fire at all types of ground targets as well as aircraft. The M1A1 was redesigned to incorporate this principle, resulting in the M2 in 1943. In the M2 the gun itself was little changed, but the mount was entirely new and provided for both rapid unlimbering and limbered fire. Because of the M2's ability to fire at land, sea, and air targets it came to be known as the &quot;triple threat&quot; gun. By the end of the war 7,831 Ml, M1A1, and M2 90mm AA guns had been built. They were used in four-gun batteries in both Mobile and Semimobile AAA Gun battalions, and also in those types of units previously equipped with 3-in. AA guns. Until mid 1943 one four-gun 90mm (or 3-in.) AA battery was also included in the Special Weapons battalion of a Marine division.</p>
<p>†RF in the ETO (other than Italy) is 1.5 for 6-7/44, 1.4 for 8-9/44, and 1.3 thereafter. RF in Italy and the PTO is 1.5.</p>
