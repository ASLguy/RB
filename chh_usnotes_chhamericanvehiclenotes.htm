<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Defense Act of 1920 made tanks a responsibility of the Infantry, under whose benign neglect U.S. tank development languished for almost a decade. In 1931 MacArthur, as the new Chief of Staff, instituted a vigorous policy of motorization and mechanization for the Army. One element of his vision was an exploitation role for mechanized cavalry using tanks, and soon afterward the Cavalry took the initiative in AFV development and tactics away from the Infantry. (Ironically, until 1940 the Cavalry was forced to call its tanks &quot;combat cars&quot; because legally only the Infantry could possess &quot;tanks&quot;.) Tank development accelerated during the 1930s; the Infantry began developing a medium tank, and several types of combat cars and light tanks entered production. However, the tight budgets of that era, coupled with America's isolationist outlook, kept production figures extremely low in view of the ominous clouds on the political horizon. Consequently, in May 1940 as the German Army was overrunning France and the Low Countries, the U.S. had only about 300 tanks in service—and of these only eighteen woefully inadequate M2A1 Mediums and ten M2A4 Lights were gun-armed (with a 37mm piece); all the rest were armed only with MG. The stunning German victory over France, and the ensuing Battle of Britain, shocked America out of its lassitude and spurred government and industry to gear up for the production of armaments in what would become fantastic quantities.</p>
<p>U.S. vehicles, with a few exceptions, were highly regarded for their reliability and ease of operation. For example, the Soviets felt that it was excellent for one of their tanks to run for fourteen hours without a mechanical failure, whereas a U.S. tank was expected to run for at least forty hours without a breakdown. Moreover, German and Japanese tank tracks had an average life of about six hundred miles, while U.S. tank tracks averaged about three thousand miles. Overall, American AFV designs were not ingenious, but usually were competent and adequate when brought into service. Unfortunately there was far too much resistance to the introduction of improved models (due to both a desire to keep production at full capacity and an unwillingness to change tactical doctrines), with the result that U.S. AFV found themselves outgunned and under-armored from 1944 on. Combined with tactics that were often less than inspired, this frequently allowed an outnumbered German force (which was sometimes more experienced but usually technically superior) to exact a heavy toll of attacking American AFV.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to factories that were safe from enemy bombs and invading armies, during WW2 the U.S. produced some 207,000 AFV (including 88,410 tanks and 53,813 halftracks) and 3,200,436 soft-skin military transport vehicles. Indeed, more U.S. tanks were Lend-Leased to the British Empire than either she or Germany produced individually. America truly was the Arsenal of Democracy.</p>
<p>The Army used an alphanumeric system of nomenclature for its vast array of materiel. This system showed not only the basic model of an item but also any modifications to it. &quot;T&quot; stood for an equipment type still in the developmental stage, while &quot;M&quot; signified a standardized type. &quot;E&quot; represented an experimental modification to the basic type, and &quot;A&quot; a standardized modification. &quot;B&quot; indicated a major change in production (e.g., a vehicle with another chassis substituted for the standard one). The number following each letter generally—but not always—gave its numerical sequence; e.g., &quot;M1E3&quot; would designate the first model of a particular type of equipment M1, which also incorporated the third in a series of experimental modifications. This M1 equipment type could be a helmet, a tank, a slide rule, etc.</p>
<p>[Note: ETO stands for European Theater of Operations, which in game terms comprises Europe and Sicily. PTO stands for Pacific Theater of Operations, which in game terms equals &quot;vs Japanese&quot;.]</p>

M2A4 Light Tank:</span> The Army's most modern light tank in 1940. 375 were built. It was a very reliable and well-armed light tank for its time, but was rapidly superseded by the improved M3 version. The M2A4 saw combat only on Guadalcanal with Company A of the 1st Marine Tank Battalion.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><img src="amerv006.jpg" width="169" height="76" alt="AmerV006" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2. M3 Light Tank:</span> A large number of improvements were made to the M2A4 in early 1941, resulting in the M3 Light Tank. 5,811 were built. A small number were with the 1st Armored Division during the Torch landings and the subsequent fighting in Tunisia. In the PTO the 192nd and 194th Tank Battalions with a total of 108 M3 Lights (and no HE ammo) formed the core of the 1st Provisional Tank Group, which was employed in the defense of the Philippines (12/41-4/42); more than thirty of them were captured by the Japanese, whose 7th Tank Regiment used them against the returning Americans in 1944-45. M3 Light Tanks were also used on Guadalcanal (8-12/42) by Company B of the 1st Marine Tank Battalion. The M3 garnered the distinction of becoming the first U.S.-built AFV to see combat in WW2 when the British used it in Operation Crusader (11/41).</p>
<p>†Dates for use in other than the PTO are 11/42-5/43. PTO Dates are 41-42.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><img src="amerv008.jpg" width="167" height="75" alt="AmerV008" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">3. M3A1 Light Tank: </span>This was an improved version of the M3 Light Tank, incorporating a remodelled turret, deletion of the two fixed BMG, and standardization of the gyrostabilizer. 4,621 were built. The M3A1 first saw action on Guadalcanal (9-12/42) with Company C of the 1st Marine Tank Battalion, and remained in widespread use with the Marines until early 1944 when the M5A1 Light Tank began to replace it. In North Africa, both Light Tank Battalions (1st of the 1st Armored Regiment and 1st of the 13th Armored Regiment) in the U.S. 1st Armored Division were equipped primarily with the M3A1.</p>
<p>†Dates and RF for use in other than the PTO are 11/42-5/43 and 1.2. PTO Dates are 9/42-44. RF in the PTO is 1.2 from 9/42 through 6/44; thereafter increase RF in this theater by . 1 for each two-month period after 6/44, until 1.5 is reached in 11/44.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><img src="amerv010.jpg" width="167" height="75" alt="AmerV010" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4. &nbsp;M3A1 Satan:</span> The need to eliminate Japanese bunkers created a requirement for flamethrower tanks. The Marines met this by replacing the MA on some of their M3A1 &nbsp;Light Tanks with a Canadian-built Ronson FT. They were first used on Saipan by Company D of the 4th Marine Tank Battalion. Each such battalion was to have 24 Satans; however, while some sources state that each possessed an average of about 18, other sources claim that only 20 Satans were ever built. The Army also used a very small number of similar vehicles (based on the M5A1) on Luzon, 4-5/45.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><img src="amerv012.jpg" width="171" height="74" alt="AmerV012" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5. M5A1 Light Tank:</span> The M5 did not replace the M3A1 but rather was produced concurrently with it, and actually entered production several months before the latter. (Since the M5 and M5A1 are equivalent in game terms there is no M5 counter.) Its front hull plates were sloped to enhance protection and its turret-front armor was increased. This new armor configuration was then also applied to the M3A1, resulting in the M3A3 which was used only for Lend-Lease purposes. While the designers were thusly creating the M3A3 they decided to also improve its gun mount and move the radio from the hull to the rear of the turret. This new turret was judged superior to that of the M5 and was consequently introduced on M5 production lines, thus creating the M5A1. Both M5 and MSA 1 were used to replace combat losses in the light tank battalions of the 1st Armored Division in Tunisia. By the time of the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, all M3 and M5A1 Lights had been withdrawn from active service in the ETO, making the M5A1 the Army's standard light tank. In the PTO the U.S. did not use the M5A1 in action until Feb. 1944, with the 4th Marine Tank Battalion on Roi-Namur. 2,074 M5 and 6,810 M5A1 were built—and altogether 19,316 M3-M5A1 Light Tanks were produced. Five constituted a platoon in both Army and Marine use. The British referred to tanks of the M3-M5A1 series as &quot;Stuarts&quot;.</p>
<p>†RF in North Africa (11/42-5/43) is 1.3; thereafter in ETO scenarios its RF is 1.1. PTO Dates are 2/44-45, while RF in this theater is 1.3 for 2-5/44, 1.2 for 6-7/44, and 1.1 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><img src="amerv014.jpg" width="170" height="75" alt="AmerV014" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6. M24 Light Tank:</span> The replacement for the M5A1 was the M24, also known as the &quot;Chaffee&quot; (for Gen. Adna Chaffee, the &quot;Father of the U.S. Armored Force&quot;). It used a modified M18 GMC chassis, while having a completely new turret that mounted a lightweight 75mm aircraft gun adapted from the B-25H Mitchell bomber. At least two (used by the 740th Tank Battalion) saw action during the Battle of the Bulge. By VE Day all Light Tank companies in the 7th Armored Division, and all Light Tank troops in mechanized cavalry squadrons in NW Europe, had been completely re-equipped with the M24. M24 production totalled 4,195 in the period 4/44-6/45. Chaffees also saw combat with U.S. forces in the postwar era, being the first tanks to reach South Korea. They went into action on July 10, 1950 near Chonui but it quickly became apparent that the M24, while an excellent recon tank, was out of its league when confronting the T-34/85.</p>
<p>†Decrease RF by .1 for every month after 12/44, until 1.3 is reached in 3/45.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><img src="amerv016.jpg" width="168" height="76" alt="AmerV016" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7. M3 Medium Tank:</span> By mid 1940 the Army had come to the conclusion that its newest medium tank (the M2A1, which carried a 37mm gun and a multitude of MG, and which had not yet even entered mass production) was outclassed by the PzKpfw IV with its 75mm gun. What the Army now desired was a tank armed with a weapon at least equivalent to the German piece. The problem was that no turret capable of carrying such a powerful weapon had ever been built in the U.S., and the development of one would necessarily take time. Meanwhile, the British were in desperate need of new tanks to replace those lost in France. The Army therefore decided to modify the M2A1 and install both a turret-mounted version of the Army's 37mm AT gun, and a limited-traverse 75mm gun (which was an adaptation of an unsuccessful AA gun) on the starboard side of its front hull. The resulting M3 Medium was viewed only as a stopgap solution until a proper 75mm tank could become available— but with the added benefit that the automotive bugs corrected on the M3 would expedite the Sherman's development since both would use essentially the same chassis. Other versions of the basic M3 were also produced, but in much smaller quantities; since they vary little in game terms they are not included in counter form.</p>
<p>In all, 6,258 were built, but only about 1,400 were retained by the U.S.; the rest were Lend-Leased to various allies. In U.S. service the M3 first saw combat in mid-June 1942 during the latter stages of the Gazala battle when three with U.S. crews (who had been sent to help familiarize the British with their new tanks) attached themselves to the British 1st Royal Tank Regiment and for a few days fought the Germans between Knights-bridge and Acroma, southwest of Tobruk; during this time they claimed the destruction of nine enemy AFV. However, its first official U.S. use came with the Torch landings and later in Tunisia with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 1st Armored Division's 13th Armored Regiment. These battalions were equipped solely with M3 types until Shermans from the 2nd Armored Division began arriving to replace combat losses. At the conclusion of the Tunisian campaign all M3 Mediums were relegated to training roles. In the PTO, their only U.S. use occurred in Nov. 1943 when the 193rd Tank Battalion aided in the seizure of Makin Atoll.</p>
<p>†B11 applies individually to both the 37LL MA and 75 SA. The 37LL MA is a T Gun, while the 75 SA is a NT Gun. Either the MA or SA can claim the possibility of multiple ROF, but only the one that fires first in a phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase) can actually use it. Either the MA and SA both have Gyrostabilizer benefits or neither does; i.e., when using HI.42 one dr applies to both Guns.</p>
<p>†The AAMG was mounted in a turreted cupola. For game purposes it can be used as a normal AAMG or, while the crew is BU, like a remotely-controlled AAMG (i.e., while BU, it cannot be used vs an Aerial target but can be used in CC).</p>
<p>†Dates for North African use are 11/42-5/43. PTO Date is 11/43 only.</p>
<p>Either the MA or SA can claim armor leader direction, but only the one that fires first in a phase (treating Defensive First and Final Fire as one phase) can actually use it.

<p><a id="8"></a><img src="amerv018.jpg" width="167" height="76" alt="AmerV018" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8. M4 Medium Tank:</span> Popularly referred to as the Sherman, the M4 Medium series was designed to be used in the role of exploitation; i.e., to assist the infantry in breaking through the enemy's defenses and then to rapidly penetrate far behind his lines to disrupt his supplies and communications. It was well-suited to this role by being highly reliable and relatively maintenance-free, and by having a gun with excellent HE characteristics. However, since current Army doctrine held that enemy tanks were to be engaged by tank destroyers rather than tanks, it was deemed unnecessary to give the Sherman any special AT capability. The Sherman used the chassis of the M3 Medium with a new superstructure and turret for its MA, and by 1944 it had become the main battle tank of all the Western Allies. The chief deficiencies of the early Shermans were: the aforementioned mediocre AT capability; a high, bulky silhouette; the use, except in the M4A1, of a number of plates welded together (as opposed to a single rolled or cast piece) to form the sloping hull front (aka the glacis), which significantly compromised the glacis' ballistic protection; and a high susceptibility to fires due mainly to exposed ammo rounds which often ruptured when a projectile penetrated the tank. A total of 49,234 Shermans were built, of which 30,600 were equipped with the 75mm gun. Of these, 6,748 were the M4 type, (which was the original design model but actually entered production in July 1942, several months after the M4A1 and M4A2 versions). No M4 Mediums were built with the 76mm gun. †PTO Dates are 1944-45.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><img src="amerv020.jpg" width="169" height="76" alt="AmerV020" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9. M4A1 Medium Tank:</span> This was the first Sherman model to enter production. It was also the only original model to have a cast upper hull; otherwise it was identical to the M4 except for carrying six fewer rounds of ammunition. 6,281 were built. The M4A1 was the only Sherman used by U.S. forces in North Africa. The game piece also represents 1,676 M4 Mediums built at the Detroit Tank Arsenal; these are often referred to as &quot;composite hull&quot; Shermans because their front hull was cast (like the M4A1) while their side and rear hulls were welded. In Army service throughout the war, a medium tank platoon consisted of five tanks.</p>
<p>†Dates for North Africa and the ETO are 12/42-5/45, with RF of 1.4 in 12/42, 1.3 in 1/43, 1.2 for 2-5/43, and .9 thereafter. PTO Dates are 12/43-45, with RF of .9.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><img src="amerv022.jpg" width="165" height="73" alt="AmerV022" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">10. &nbsp;M4A2 Medium Tank:</span> This Sherman model used two GMC diesel engines. 8,052 [including the M4A2 (L) model] were ultimately built, making this type the most numerous of the 75mm Shermans—but as the Army preferred gasoline powered vehicles most were assigned to Lend-Lease and only 640 were retained in U.S. service. The only U.S. combat use of the M4A2 was with the USMC, since many of the Navy's small craft were also diesel-powered and both could use the same fuel. The M4A2's operational debut was with Company C of the 1st Marine Amphibious Corps Tank Battalion in the assault on Betio (Tarawa Atoll). A Marine medium tank platoon comprised four Shermans prior to April 1944, three from then until April 1945 (with two bow-mounted FT also authorized), and five Shermans thereafter (with three FT Shermans per company).</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><img src="amerv024.jpg" width="166" height="77" alt="AmerV024" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">11. M4A2 (L) Medium Tank:</span> The final-production M4A2s in 1944 incorporated the new front hull design that was coming into use on all the Shermans (other than the M4 and M4A1). This new design replaced the multi-piece welded glacis with a thicker one-piece unit. Shermans with this glacis are generally described as having the 47 ° front hull, which refers to the glacis plate's inclination from the vertical. About 1,600 of the M4A2 (L) were constructed. &quot;(L)&quot; in the piece name indicates &quot;late model&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><img src="amerv026.jpg" width="170" height="74" alt="AmerV026" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">12. M4A3 Medium Tank:</span> The M4A3 differed from other early Shermans by having a Ford V8 engine. Due to this engine's high output, compact design, and ease of maintenance, the M4A3 became the preferred model for Army service; however, the original model's production was insufficient to supply the Army's entire needs and it remained a minority type. 1,690 were built. †PTO Dates are 1944-45.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><img src="amerv028.jpg" width="168" height="75" alt="AmerV028" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">13. M4A3(75)W Medium Tank:</span> Beginning in Feb. 1944 all newly-built models of the 75mm-armed M4A3 incorporated both the 47 ° glacis and a new arrangement for ammunition stowage wherein all MA rounds were now stowed on or beneath the turret floor in racks that contained jackets filled with antifreeze and water. Thus if a shellcase were ruptured by a projectile or fragment the liquid would douse any exposed propellant, extinguishing or at least hampering any resultant fire. This was known as ' 'Wet Stowage'', and cured the Sherman of its tendency to rapidly &quot;brew up&quot; when penetrated. The M4A3(75)W remained in production until March 1945, long after all other 75mm versions had been discontinued. 3,071 were built.</p>
<p>†PTO Dates are 10/44-45.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><img src="amerv030.jpg" width="339" height="76" alt="AmerV030" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">14. M4A3E2 &amp; M4A3E2 (L) Medium Tanks:</span> To provide a heavily armored assault tank, 254 M4A3(75)W were produced between May and July 1944 with an extra 1½ inches of armor plate on the hull front and upper hull sides, a new lower front hull casting 5½ inches thick, and a new turret with 6-inch cast armor and a 7-inch thick gunshield. All originally carried the 75mm gun but in early 1945 permission was granted to field-mount the 76mm weapon instead. As this conversion could be easily accomplished, the Dates for the 76mm version have been extended back into 1944 to allow for possible &quot;unauthorized&quot; conversions. The M4A3E2 was nicknamed the &quot;Jumbo&quot; and was a very successful variant, often being used as the lead vehicle in a column when moving through unfriendly territory. Not surprisingly, it played a prominent role in the drive to relieve Bastogne. Apparently neither version was used in Italy.</p>
<p>†RF for the M4A3E2 (L) is 1.6 from 10/44 through 3/45, and 1.5 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><img src="amerv032.jpg" width="164" height="74" alt="AmerV032" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">15. M4A1(76)W Medium Tank:</span> Attempts had been made to upgun the Sherman with a high velocity 76mm gun as early as mid 1942 but the Army Ground Forces, which formulated Army tactical doctrines, would not allow its production. The AGF steadfastly believed that the current Sherman was an ideal balance of firepower, armor protection, and mobility, and did not want to disrupt production for a change it considered non-essential. Moreover, it held that tanks should be used for infantry support and exploitation, and that enemy tanks should be left to tank destroyers— which sounded fine in theory but which often proved impossible to comply with in battle. Eventually the 76mm-armed Sherman did go into production but the delayed decision, along with the reluctance of field commanders (including Patton) to introduce the new weapon on the very eve of the Normandy landings, resulted in none being included in the invasion forces. However, the first clashes with Panthers and Tigers revealed the relative impotence of the 75mm gun against these well-armored tanks. 76mm Shermans were therefore rushed across the Channel as quickly as possible with the initial intent of arming one-third of each Sherman unit with them, but by VE Day well over half the Shermans in U.S. units carried the more potent 76. Unfortunately even this gun proved to be only marginally effective against the frontal armor of a Panther or Tiger.</p>
<p>The M4A1(76)W was the initial production version of the 76mm Sherman. It consisted of a slightly-modified M4A1 hull and chassis with Wet Stowage and the turret of the T23 Medium Tank (a forerunner of the M26 Pershing). 3,426 were built. †RF is 1.2 in 1944 and 1.1 in 1945.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><img src="amerv034.jpg" width="164" height="76" alt="AmerV034" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">16. M4A3(76)W Medium Tank:</span> This used the hull and chassis of the M4A3(75)W as well as the new 76mm-armed turret. It was built in greater numbers than any other 76mm Sherman, with 4,542 being produced. Of these, more than half used the new HVSS (Horizontal Volute Spring Suspension) system to give the tank a better ride and lower ground pressure (though not low enough to qualify for low ground pressure in game terms). With HVSS this tank was designated the M4A3E8, from which arose its nickname &quot;Easy Eight&quot;. †RF is 1.1 through 10/44, 1.0 from 11/44 to 2/45, and .9 thereafter.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><img src="amerv036.jpg" width="336" height="75" alt="AmerV036" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">17. M4(105) &amp; M4A3(105) Medium Tanks: </span>The original design of the Sherman's 75mm gun turret allowed for the alternate installation of a 105mm howitzer. Production of the M4(105) amounted to 1641, with about half having the new HVSS system. M4A3(105) production totalled 3039, with all but about 500 having HVSS. The howitzer-armed Shermans had neither power traverse, gyrostabilizer, nor Wet Stowage (their ammo being kept in armored bins instead). Three of these tanks formed the basis of the assault gun platoon in the HQ company of an Army medium tank battalion, and one (two in 1945) was also present in the HQ platoon of each of that battalion's medium tank companies.</p>
<p>†ETO RF for the M4(105) is 1.4 in 1944 and 1.3 in 1945; that for the M4A3(105) is 1.3 in 1944 and 1.2 in 1945. PTO Dates and RF for both AFV are 10/44-45 and 1.3 respectively.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><img src="amerv038.jpg" width="166" height="73" alt="AmerV038" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">18. M4 Tankdozer:</span> Aside from engineer field-built tankdozers, a special kit consisting of a dozer blade and associated components was developed for the Sherman. This kit was designated the M1, and 1,957 were produced by the end of the war. Tankdozers were usually operated by combat engineers and could also be found in Medium Tank Battalions (Special). Sixteen tankdozers using the M1 kit were assigned to the assault on Omaha Beach but only five landed still fit to be used as bulldozers. As of April 1944 each Marine medium tank company was authorized one M1 dozer kit. For tankdozer usage see &quot;Bulldozers&quot; in Index.</p>
<p>†Due to the extra protection afforded by the dozer blade, a special +2 To Hit DRM applies to the calculation of a front-hull hit vs a Tankdozer unless the firer is at least one full level higher than the target. This is signified by &quot; + 2 for HH&quot; on the counter. &quot;+2 for HH&quot; is NA vs mortar fire. [errata notes]</p>
<p>EX: If a Gun needs a Final DR of 10 to hit the front Target Facing of a Tankdozer, it will strike the hull only if the Final DR is ≤ 8 (and the colored die is ≥ the white die).</p>

T1E3:</span> This ungainly combination of Sherman and 27-ton roller mine exploder, nicknamed the &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;, was the Army's most widely used mine clearance vehicle. About 200 were built but it is doubtful that even half of them saw action. The &quot;Mine Exploder, T1E3&quot; consisted of a normal 75mm-gun Sherman with special drive sprockets that not only propelled the tank but also drove, via a system of roller chains and shafts, two groups of five pancake-shaped rollers that stood on edge ahead of the tank tracks. Each roller was eight feet in diameter, 2½-in. thick, and weighed more than two tons, and their collective ground pressure would detonate any mines directly ahead of the tracks. Unfortunately, the mine rollers sank rapidly into soft ground and the vehicle had great difficulty in negotiating hills. To aid its movement the T1E3 had a curved plate attached to its hull rear, thus enabling it to be pushed by another tank when necessary. Two T1E3 were used to lead road columns of the 6th Armored Division in its attack south of Lessay on July 29, 1944; others were later used near Brest and in the Nancy-Metz area. Apparently none were used in Italy.</p>
<p>†MOVEMENT: The T1E3 may change its VCA only one hexside in a particular hex, and only immediately after entering that hex; i.e., when it expends MP to enter a new hex it may then expend another MP to change its VCA one hexside, but thereafter as long as it remains in that hex it cannot again change its VCA—nor can it change its VCA in a hex wherein it has just expended a Start MP. The T1E3 may not enter a building or woods, or rubble [EXC: via a TB], and may not ford a stream or river, conduct an OVR, or use VBM. Moreover, it may not move to a different elevation unless on a road. A T1E3 may cross a wall/hedge hexside; see &quot;BOG:&quot; below. A T1E3 may not cross a Bocage hexside, even via a Breach; nor may it create a Breach itself.</p>
<p>†BOG: A T1E3 crossing a wall/hedge hexside (not bocage) in either forward or reverse mode must make a Bog DR; if it bogs it remains in the hex it was attempting to leave. It must also make a Bog DR when it enters a Trench hex. A bogged T1E3 can attempt to free itself as per <a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">D8.3</a> only if another fully-tracked AFV of a 25 tons is in the T1E3's Location to help push it. Both AFV must have coinciding VCA, and the pushing AFV is subject to all the rules given in <a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">D8.3</a> for an assisting AFV (i.e., one that grants a -1 drm to the colored die of the Bog Removal DR); however this -1 drm does not apply to the TIES's unbogging attempt. Conversely, a T1E3 may not be used to grant such a -1 drm to another vehicle's unbogging attempt.</p>
<p>†CLEARANCE: A T1E3 clears mines like a flail tank (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.7" class="topiclink">B28.7-.72</a>), with the following exceptions. Each time a T1E3 enters a new hex, the player owning mines in that hex must announce their presence (but not type or strength). The T1E3's owner then makes his Mine Clearance DR, but there is a +2 DRM to that DR unless when entering that hex the T1E3 paid twice the normal MP cost and did not use the CE road movement cost. A Final Mine Clearance DR of 11 or ≥ 12 is treated as per <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.72" class="topiclink">B28.72</a> or <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.71" class="topiclink">B28.71</a> respectively. A T1E3 need not be, or remain, in Motion in order to attempt Mine Clearance, even in the last hex it enters during the MPh. If the T1E3 reveals the presence of mines while CE it must immediately become BU (even if not normally allowed to do so).</p>
<p>†TO HIT: Due to the obstruction caused by the mine rollers, all attacks [EXC: mines, CC, Indirect Fire, those to/from at least a full-level higher elevation, and those whose LOS to/from the TIES coincides with the center hexspine of its VCA] vs/by a TIES within its VCA receive a +4 TH (or Effects for non-ordnance) DRM—as signified by &quot;VCA: +4 DRM&quot; on the counter.</p>

Sherman Crab: </span>The U.S. and Britain experimented with a wide variety of roller, plow, and explosive-device mine clearance AFV, but none were as successful as the British-designed Sherman Crab, which used chains attached to a revolving drum to beat the ground ahead of the tank. This flailing action detonated any mines and, as the tank inched forward at 1¼ mph, cleared a path whose width equalled the vehicle's. A small number were used by U.S. forces in Europe. See <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.7" class="topiclink">B28.7-.72</a> for usage rules. The game piece also represents the experimental T3 Mine Exploder, twelve of which were used by the 6617th Mine Clearing Company during the breakout from Anzio (5/44) and the drive to Rome. The use of flail tanks in the PTO was restricted to a few field-improvised types.</p>
<p>†A flail tank can attempt to clear wire in a non-woods/non-building (only) Location by making a Mine Clearance DR. If that DR results in successful mine clearance (regardless of the presence of mines), that wire counter is removed (along with any mines). All other possible results of that DR are still applicable. A flail tank that successfully clears wire by this method is not subject to a Bog DR due to that wire (<a href="chb_chb26.htm#26.43" class="topiclink">B26.43</a>); however, if the tank is unsuccessful and must undergo the Bog DR, <a href="chb_chb26.htm#26.53" class="topiclink">B26.53</a> applies unchanged.</p>
<p>†If used in the PTO or pre-7/44 in Italy, a +1 DRM applies to the Mine Clearance DR, and the DR given in <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.7" class="topiclink">B28.7-.72</a> for each possible result is assumed to be a Final DR.</p>
<p>†Dates for ETO use are 5-6/44 (for the T3 version in Italy) and 7/44-5/45 (for the Crab). PTO Dates are also 7/44-45.</p>

POA-CWS-H1 Flame Tank:</span> The demand in the PTO for a more heavily armored tank with a main armament flamethrower resulted in the Ronson FT being mounted in a Sherman. The breech end of the tank's gun was replaced by the FT apparatus so the FT could fire through the 75mm gun barrel, thus making the FT version virtually indistinguishable from the original tank. (This camouflage was desired because flame tanks always became prime targets when identified by the enemy.) Eight POA using the M4A3(75)W chassis were used on Iwo Jima: four each with the 4th and 5th Marine Tank Battalions, first going into action on Feb. 21, 1945. Fifty-four &quot;composite-hull&quot; M4 Mediums were also converted to POA flame tanks and were designated the 713th Tank Battalion (Armored Flamethrower). They were sent to Okinawa where they were parceled out amongst the other attacking divisions, going into action on April 19, 1945. 41 were knocked out (with 26 subsequently repaired and returned to duty) with no crew fatalities— an exceptional record for a flame tank.</p>
<p>†The TCA may not traverse into or through the tank's &quot;rear&quot; VCA (as defined in <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#j" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note J</a>). This is signified on the counter by &quot;TCA:NA RVCA&quot;.</p>
<p>†Use an M4A1 or M4A2 (L) Medium Tank counter to represent the POA-CWS-H1 until the FT fires, or the M4Al's smoke mortar fires with a DR of 6-8, or the tank is destroyed (for CS purposes).</p>
<p>†Used only on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. RF is 1.4 from 4/45 on.</p>

M26 Heavy Tank:</span> The Pershing originated with the T20 Medium Tank, which was to be the eventual replacement for the Sherman with approximately the same firepower and armor protection as the Tiger I. Ultimately a prototype designated the T26E3 Medium Tank appeared in the spring of 1944 equipped with a 90mm gun derived from the AA piece. As a minor exercise in psychology it was then redesignated a Heavy Tank. The first shipment of twenty arrived in Europe as part of the Zebra Mission (which was to oversee the combat trials of a variety of new weapon types). The 3rd and 9th Armored Divisions each received ten T26E3, and these new tanks went into combat on Feb. 25 and Feb. 28 respectively. In March 1945 the T26E3 was standardized as the M26 Heavy Tank. Other units to use the M26 (from 4/45 on) were the 2nd, 5th, and 11th Armored Divisions. The most famous action involving Pershings was the capture on March 7, 1945, of the Ludendorff railway bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, in which four Pershings of Company A, 14th Tank Battalion, 9th Armored Division, played a leading role. Ironically, the Pershings never crossed the badly-damaged bridge as they were considered too heavy for it; instead they were ferried across the Rhine five days later. By VE Day over 700 Pershings had been built, of which 310 were in Europe (none were sent to Italy).The M26 Heavy Tank was also used in Korea (by which time it had once again been designated a Medium Tank), but the lighter and more agile M4A3(76)W was preferred in that rugged countryside. †RF is 1.5 after 3/45.</p>

Its main armament was a modified 3-in. AA gun which was massive and heavy; consequently two 1800-lb. counterweights had to be attached to the rear of the M10's turret to balance it. Other features unusual for a U.S. &quot;tank&quot; were its lack of power traverse and the use of twin diesel engines. 4,993 were built. The M10 GMC equipped the 899th and 776th TD Battalions (Heavy SP) in Tunisia, with four per platoon; after that campaign it became the standard AFV of all Tank Destroyer Battalions (SP) in the ETO until the latter half of 1944 when the M18 and M36 GMC began to replace it. In the PTO only three M10-equipped TD Battalions (or elements thereof) saw action: the 632nd, 640th, and 819th. A few were also used on Kwajalein by the 767th Tank Battalion. From late 1943 through 1945 a U.S. TD platoon (SP) consisted of four TD, two M20 (or M3A1) Scout Cars, and one Jeep.</p>
<p>†ETO RF is as follows: 1.5 for 3-8/43; 1.3 for 9/43-5/44; 1.1 for 6-8/44; 1.2 for 9-12/44; and 1.3 in 1945. PTO RF is 1.3, with Dates of 10/43-45.</p>

M18 GMC:</span> The M18 (nicknamed the &quot;Hellcat&quot;) was a completely new TD design, and was intended to be as light and fast as possible. Thus it had only half-inch armor front, sides, and rear (with a 1-in. thick gunshield), and instead of using the heavy gun of the M10 it used the lighter 76mm weapon of the Sherman. The M18's low weight gave it a high degree of mobility which, it was believed, would compensate for its thin armor. Indeed, it proved to be the fastest tracked vehicle of WW2, and was well-liked by its crews since its mobility allowed rapid changes of position during an engagement. Overall the M18 came closest to the Tank Destroyer Board's original concept of the true TD. 2,507 were built. The M18 was the intended replacement for the M10 GMC and could have been in combat by the end of 1943, but its deployment was withheld because commanders in the ETO preferred to wait for the more-heavily-armed M36 GMC which was itself nearing the production phase in late 1943. No M18-equipped TD battalions served in Italy, but some M18 were used there in 1945 by the 752nd Tank Battalion. In the PTO only one M18 TD battalion saw combat; this was the 637th, which fought on Luzon.</p>
<p>†Decrease ETO RF by .1 for each two-month period after 8/44, until 1.2 is reached in 3/45 [EXC: Dates and RF for use in Italy are 1945 and 1.5 respectively]. PTO Dates and RF are 1-6/45 and 1.4.</p>

M36 GMC:</span> The M36 Gun Motor Carriage was basically an M10A1 GMC (an M4A3 Medium with an M10 GMC turret; none saw combat) with a new turret and a 90mm gun derived from the M1 towed AA weapon. 1,413 were built. Because of its potent gun the M36 was the most successful of the three main U.S. TD. Like the others however, it was all too often expected to double as a tank—a task for which it was not well suited due to its thinner armor, weak MG FP, and open top. The realization that TD were not as adaptable as tanks to the various demands of the battlefield resulted in the demise of the TD Command in 1946. The M36 GMC was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Jackson&quot; or the &quot;Slugger&quot;. Apparently none were used in Italy. †RF is 1.6 in 8/44, 1.5 in 9/44, 1.3 for 10-11/44, and 1.1 thereafter.</p>

M36B1 GMC: </span>The continuing demand for 90mm Gun Motor Carriages resulted in a composite vehicle which consisted of an M36 GMC turret on an M4A3(75)W Medium Tank. This TD was taller and heavier than the M36 but retained the BMG and thicker hull armor of the Sherman. A total of 187 were built in late 1944. Apparently none were used in Italy.</p>

M2 Halftrack:</span> The M2 Halftrack was intended to be used as a recon vehicle (it replaced the M3A1 Scout Car in certain mechanized cavalry roles during 1943), mortar or MG carrier, and artillery prime mover. It could seat ten including the driver, and its armament officially consisted of two MG: one .50-cal and one air-cooled .30-cal, with both mounted on a skate rail that ringed the passenger compartment to allow them a form of 360° traverse. (Other MG combinations existed as field modifications but have been excluded for simplicity.) M2 production totalled 11,415 vehicles. 1,643 M2A1 halftracks were also built during 1943-44; these replaced the skate rail with a pulpit mount (as in the M3A1 halftrack) but are not included in the game. Since the M3 halftrack was larger and proved to be more versatile, the M2 types became less common towards the war's end.</p>
<p>†Dates for non-PTO use are 11/42-5/45, with RF of 1.1 for 11/42-43 and 1.2 thereafter. PTO RF is 1.3 for 41-45.</p>

It was slightly longer than the M2 and could seat thirteen including the driver. Its single .30-cal air-cooled MG was pedestal-mounted in the center-foward section of the passenger compartment. 12,499 were built. Compared to their German counterparts, U.S. halftracks had superior overall mobility by virtue of their higher top speed, driven front axles, and front bumper-mounted roller (to help prevent digging into the side of a ditch or steep incline) or winch. On the other hand, U.S. halftracks had no floor armor (thus making their occupants vulnerable to mines), higher ground pressure, and tracks that tended to wear out quickly. In game terms a 1942-43 armored infantry platoon consisted of three M3, one M2, and one M3(MMG) halftrack; three M3 with one passenger squad each (and one 60mm MTR in one of the halftracks), one M2 towing a 37mm AT Gun and carrying its crew, and one M3(MMG) for MG support.</p>
<p>†MA is a MMG for To Kill and Removal purposes—as signified by &quot;MA: MMG&quot; on the counter.</p>

M3A1 Halftrack:</span> This differed from the M3 Halftrack by having a .50-cal MG on a ring mount (also commonly known as a &quot;pulpit&quot;) to the right of the driver, and an air-cooled .30-cal MG on one of three pintle mounts that were located on the side and rear walls of the passenger compartment. 2,862 M3A1 were built. Many M3 halftracks were also converted to M3A1 by the addition of a pulpit kit. Versions with additional MG were quite common but are not included in the game. In game terms a 1944-45 armored infantry platoon consisted of one M3A1 halftrack carrying the platoon leader and a squad, two M3 halftracks with a passenger squad apiece, one M3 with a passenger HS and a 60mm MTR, and one M3(MMG) halftrack. Such a platoon possessed tremendous firepower for an &quot;infantry&quot; unit (even with just its official weapons allotment), but it should be noted that the squads usually dismounted before attacking because their halftracks were vulnerable to the lightest of AT weapons and even close-range MG fire. In fact, halftracks were sometimes referred to as &quot;Purple Heart Boxes&quot;. †Non-PTO RF is 1.2. PTO RF is 1.4.</p>

M3(MMG) &amp; M3(HMG) Halftracks:</span> The M3(MMG) Halftrack represents the vehicle used to provide MG support for the armored infantry platoon, with one M3(MMG) per such platoon. The squad carried in this vehicle was historically referred to as a LMG squad since the Army called its air-cooled .30-cal a LMG, but in order to avoid confusion this weapon is termed a MMG in the game.</p>
<p><img src="amerv064.jpg" width="453" height="572" alt="AmerV064" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />The M3(HMG) represents the vehicle used in the armored infantry battalion's MG platoon, which consisted of three such vehicles. While the armament of these vehicles could vary considerably, for game purposes the M3(MMG) is assumed to carry one .50-cal MG along with two air-cooled .30-cal MG while the M3(HMG) is assumed to carry one .50-cal MG and two water-cooled .30-cal MG. Neither of these halftracks were used in these roles in the PTO, since no armored infantry was employed there.</p>
<p>†This halftrack starts each scenario with an Inherent crew, and also with a 6-6-6 (or as otherwise specified by SSR) squad, or that squad's two HS (owner's option of squad or HS), as a Passenger that applies to the vehicle's PP capacity (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>).</p>
<p>†The AAMG FP actually consists of three MG: one .50-cal HMG (MA; 4 FP), and two secondary .30-cal MG [each a 4 FP MMG in the M3(MMG), or each a 6 FP HMG in the M3(HMG)]. This is signified on the counter by &quot;4MA&amp;4&amp;4&quot; for the M3(MMG), and by &quot;4MA&amp;6&amp;6&quot; for the M3(HMG). The MA .50-cal AAMG may fire normally in any direction. However, neither of the two secondary .30-cal AAMG may fire at a target that lies within the halftrack's VCA. One secondary AAMG may fire at a target that lies either to one &quot;side&quot; of the halftrack or within its &quot;rear&quot; VCA, while the other secondary AAMG may fire in like manner to either the halftrack's &quot;other side&quot; or within its &quot;rear,&quot; VCA. In addition to Removal as per <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>, the AFV's Passenger(s) may Remove its secondary AAMG as (a) dm MMG [for the M3(MMG)] or (b) dm HMG [for the M3(HMG)]. The MA of both AFV may be Removed (but only as per <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>) as a dm .50-cal HMG. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata notes]</span> &nbsp;See the accompanying diagram and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note E</a>.</p>

Unfortunately, since it was assumed that the mortar would always be dismounted before being fired, the mounting faced to the rear and had an extremely limited traverse. 572 were built. A platoon of three was included in the HQ company of an Army tank battalion and armored infantry battalion. It was apparently not used in the PTO.</p>

Consequently the M21 Mortar Carrier, based on the M3 Halftrack, was designed with a forward-facing mortar. 110 were built, of which 54 were ultimately used by the Free French. In addition, some units (e.g., the 2nd Armored Division) modified their old M4 and M4A1 MC so that they fired forward. Apparently none were used in the PTO.</p>

The M3 Gun Motor Carriage Halftrack used an M3 Halftrack modified to carry an M1897A4 field gun. Production began in late 1941, and in December of that year 50 arrived in the Philippines where they were used as SP artillery until the fall of Bataan. Altogether 2,202 were built, but 1,360 were later converted to M3A1 Halftracks. In the PTO the M3 GMC was used successfully by the USMC (who often referred to it as the &quot;SPM&quot; [Self-Propelled Mount]) until the war's end, with each infantry regiment in a Marine division having a platoon of two (four after April 1944) in its weapons company, and until that same date the divisional Special Weapons battalion also had three such platoons. The M3 GMC was the only type of halftrack employed in Marine divisions. In Tunisia the M3 GMC was used in the 601st, 701st, 805th, 813th, and 894th TD Battalions (Heavy SP), with four per platoon. They met with mixed success in that campaign; their thin armor caused many to be knocked out, but when properly used in ambushes from HD positions they were effective vs Axis armor. M3 CMC were also used in Sicily by the 601st TD Battalion.</p>
<p>†Optional AAMG is available only for USMC use, is a .50-cal HMG, and has a 1.0 RF.</p>

T30 HMC Halftrack:</span> The T30 Howitzer Motor Carriage was an expediency, designed to provide a self-propelled close-support AFV. It was usually referred to as an assault gun, and consisted of an M3 Halftrack carrying a 75mm pack howitzer. 500 were built. A platoon of three was allotted to the HQ company of each Army tank battalion and armored infantry battalion, and a platoon was also included in the armored regiment's recon company. In addition, the infantry regiments initially used in the Mediterranean area included two such platoons in their cannon company. The T30 HMC fought only in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. †RF is 1.1 through 8/43; thereafter increase it by .1 for each month until 1.5 is reached in 12/43.</p>

Only eight rounds of ammo were carried aboard the vehicle; hence it towed an ammo trailer. The T19 equipped the armored field artillery battalions of the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions (with six per battery), and two were included in the cannon company of infantry regiments initially used in the Mediterranean area. Those in armored field artillery battalions were gradually replaced by the new and far-superior M7 HMC during the Tunisian campaign, while those in regimental cannon companies were eventually superseded by the M3 105mm howitzer.</p>
<p>†This halftrack is assumed to be towing an armored (0/0 AF) ammo trailer which, by its owner's announcement, can be unhooked at the start of its MPh if it is not in Motion and its crew is CE. Unhooking is accomplished by simply flipping the counter over to the side showing no trailer. Its MP allotment is thus increased to 19 (although the act of unhooking the trailer costs the vehicle one-fourth of this new MP allotment), while its WGT becomes 9 and its B# becomes (9). The trailer is always assumed to be hooked up at the start of a scenario, and an unhooked trailer cannot be hooked up again. A hooked-up trailer is otherwise treated as per <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">C10.4-.41</a>. If the halftrack is destroyed, replace it with the wreck counter of another halftrack that has the same MG armament.</p>

M15A1 MGMC Halftrack:</span> This vehicle consisted of an M3 Halftrack altered to carry a 37mm AA gun and two coaxial .50-cal MG, with armor plates around the front and sides of the gun to provide crew protection. The first 80 were designated T28E1 and sent to Tunisia where they were highly successful in the AA role. Their crews found that they could lure an enemy aircraft to its destruction by opening fire at long range with just the .50-cals; the enemy pilot would note the trajectory of the tracers and assume he could fly closer at no risk—but if he did the 37mm gun would then open fire with an increased chance of a hit. The T28E1 was standardized in 1943 as the M15 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage, and at this time the armor plates around the gun mount were added. The main production model was the M15A1, which differed from the M15 only in how the MA and CMC were mounted. Production of all versions amounted to 2,332 vehicles. Those used in Tunisia were assigned to TD battalions (Heavy SP), with six vehicles per battery. Later in 1943 they were removed from TD battalions and placed in various types of AAA [Anti-Aircraft Artillery] Automatic Weapons battalions, which were usually either attached to divisions or directly controlled at Army level. At the same time the size of an AA halftrack battery was reduced to four such vehicles.</p>
<p>†The turret's rear Target Facing is unarmored. However, in North African scenarios the vehicle's entire side and rear Target Facings (both hull and turret) are treated as unarmored.</p>

M16 MGMC Halftrack:</span> This was an M3 Halftrack carrying four .50-cal MG mounted coaxially on an electrically-powered Maxson turret. With a maximum rate of fire of 2,200 rounds per minute and a traverse rate of 60° per second it proved to be very deadly against low-flying aircraft, and was also a devastating weapon when used for ground support; hence its nickname of &quot;meat chopper&quot;. The M16 MGMC was used in AAA Automatic Weapons battalions in the same manner as the M15A1 MGMC, with the AA halftracks in these battalions ideally having a 50/50 mix of the two types.</p>

Most were found in the mechanized cavalry recon troops of infantry, and armored divisions—usually in platoons of three or four vehicles each. Others were used in TD battalions and the scout company of Marine light tank battalions—in both cases, in sections of two vehicles each. Almost 21,000 M3A1 Scout Cars were built, and were one of the first U.S. vehicles to be Lend-Leased (in which role they were still being used in 1945). Some were still being used by the U.S. 1st Army in Europe as late as 10/44—probably as commanders' vehicles.</p>

The requirement for such a vehicle came from the Tank Destroyer Force who wished to replace their obsolete M3A1 Scout Cars; thus most M20 were used in TD battalions for command, scouting, and cargo-carrying purposes. 3,791 were built. In 1944-45 each TD platoon (SP), in addition to four Gun Motor Carriages and a Jeep, also contained two M20 Scout Cars that conducted local reconnaissance for the platoon and afforded it extra protection against close assaults by enemy infantry.</p>

The M8's light weight and 6x6 drive gave it excellent speed and cross-country mobility, making it well-liked by its crews despite being rather thin-skinned and undergunned when confronting serious opposition. 8,523 were built. From late 1943, each mechanized cavalry recon platoon was authorized one section of three M8, while each TD battalion was authorized 2-6 M8; see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#54" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 54</a> for more details.</p>

It consisted of a modified M5 Light Tank with a new turret that mounted a modified pack howitzer. 1,778 were built. Each divisional mechanized cavalry recon squadron had a troop of eight M8 HMC in four platoons of two each (three platoons if a nondivisional squadron), and the HQ company of armored infantry battalions and Army light and medium tank battalions had an assault gun platoon of three, replacing their old T30 HMC Halftracks.

It was standardized as the M7 Howitzer Motor Carriage, and 3,490 were built. Another 826 were built based on the M4A3 Medium Tank and designated the M7B1 HMC; for simplicity this version is not included in the game. The M7 HMC first saw combat with U.S. forces in Tunisia, where as the opportunity arose it replaced the T19 HMC Halftrack in the armored field artillery battalions of the 1st Armored Division. Thereafter it became the standard equipment of all armored field artillery battalions, with six per battery. Some sources state that the HQ company of an armored infantry battalion contained an assault gun platoon of three M7 HMC (instead of M8 HMC), but this is not reflected in the 9/43 Table of Organization for that battalion. In the PTO, six M7 HMC formed the cannon company of at least some Army infantry regiments that fought in the Philippines and on Okinawa, while the regimental weapons company of a Marine division was authorized a platoon of four M7 in May 1945. The British called the M7 the &quot;Priest&quot; because of the pulpit-like appearance of its .50-cal AAMG mount.</p>

M12 GMC:</span> This was an M1917 or M1918-type 155mm gun on a much-modified M3 Medium Tank chassis, with a retractable spade at the rear to help absorb the gun's recoil. 100 were built and remained in the U.S. until 1944 when 74 were sent to Normandy between June and August with the nondivisional 174th, 258th, 557th, 558th, 987th, and 991st Field Artillery Battalions (SP). They proved particularly valuable after the Normandy breakout by often being the only heavy artillery that could keep pace with the rapid advance across France while still being able to provide support at short notice. The M12 GMC was sometimes referred to as the &quot;King Kong&quot;, and was used in batteries of four.</p>
<p>†Due to the M12's configuration most of the crew actually stood outside of and behind it while serving the gun. Therefore, one side of the counter shows the AFV &quot;limbered&quot; while the other side shows it &quot;unlimbered&quot;. To change modes the counter is flipped over during any friendly PFPh/DFPh, provided its inherent crew is not stunned, shocked, pinned, or broken, and neither the crew nor the MA has fired; both the crew and AFV then become TI. The MA may not fire while &quot;limbered&quot;. While the M12 is &quot;unlimbered&quot; it may not expend MP, it is treated as an RFNM Gun (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.25" class="topiclink">C10.25</a>) for To Hit purposes, and its crew is always CE as per <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.84" class="topiclink">D6.84</a> (but with only a +1 CE DRM [0 DRM if attacked through its unarmored Target Facing; <a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.311" class="topiclink">D5.311</a>])—as signified by &quot;CE: + 1&quot; on the counter.</p>

LVT(A)1:</span> After the near-disaster at Tarawa, it was decided that in future assault landings the initial wave would need an armored type of LVT, plus amphibious tanks for close support. This resulted in the LVT(A)2 (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#50" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 50</a>), and also the LVT(A)1 which consisted of an LVT(A)2 with its cargo compartment roofed-over to carry a turret derived from that on the M5A1 Light Tank. In addition, on both sides of the turret and aft of it was a scarf-mounted .30-cal MG operated by a gunner who stood through a hole in the roof. 509 were built, and their first combat use was in the Kwajalein Atoll landings with the Army's 708th Amphibian Tank Battalion and the Marines' 1st Armored Amphibian Battalion. An LVT(A)1 or (A)4 platoon consisted of five vehicles (of one or both types), although in action there were usually six since one of the three company HQ LVT(A)l/(A)4s accompanied the platoon. &quot;LVT&quot; stands for &quot;Landing Vehicle, Tracked&quot;, while &quot;(A)&quot; indicates that it was constructed using armor plate (rather than soft steel).</p>
<p>†The AAMG FP actually consists of two 4 FP MMG, neither of which may fire within the LVT's VCA [EXC: during CC]. These are signified by &quot;4&amp;4;NA VCA&quot; on the counter. One AAMG may fire at a target that lies either to one &quot;side&quot; of the LVT or within its &quot;rear&quot; VCA, while the other AAMG may fire in like manner to either its &quot;other side&quot; or within its &quot;rear&quot; VCA.

LVT(A)4:</span> The inability of the LVT(A)1 to deal with heavily fortified positions led to the development of another amphibious tank based on the LVT(A)2 but having greater HE firepower. The LVT(A)4 differed from the (A)1 by carrying the turret of the M8 HMC and not having scarf-mounted MG positions. Unfortunately, its OT turret and weaker MG FP made it more vulnerable to Japanese close assault tactics, so extra MG began to appear on it almost immediately after its introduction. 1,890 LVT(A)4 were built, and their first combat use was at Saipan. Despite its &quot;Tank&quot; designation, the LVT(A)4 was intended to be used as an assault gun and SP artillery piece, and had been armed with a howitzer specifically for such a dual direct/indirect fire role. †RF is 1.4 prior to 1945.</p>
<p><a id="48"></a><img src="amerv102.jpg" width="169" height="74" alt="AmerV102" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">48. &nbsp;M4 DD Medium Tank:</span> The basic principles of the DD system are given in footnote <a href="chd_chdfootnotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">D13</a>. To go into more detail, the waterproof canvas screen was attached to steel decking that had been welded on around the tank's hull at the fender line, and was erected by using compressed air to inflate rubber air tubes attached to the decking and the frame of the screen. After the screen had been raised, hinged struts were locked into place to keep it rigid. Erecting and securing the screen took about fifteen minutes, and care had to be taken when moving the tank so as to not tear the screen by hitting a tree limb, etc. Steering was effected by the tank commander who stood on a platform attached to the rear of the turret and controlled a tiller that angled the propellers. Once ashore, the screen was dropped by the driver's actuating hydraulic plungers which unlocked the struts and opened the air valves. One slight drawback to the DD system was that the screen's frame blocked the line of fire from the BMG until the screen was removed. While afloat the DD tank itself was not visible from the ground due to the screen, and drew relatively little fire from the enemy who thought it just a small boat.</p>
<p>During the Normandy landings DD Shermans were used by three U.S. tank battalions: the 70th (30 launched, of which one sank) on Utah Beach, and the 741st (29 launched, of which 27 sank; 3 ship-landed on the beach) and 743rd (32 ship-landed) on Omaha Beach. The intention was to have them land several minutes before the infantry so as to provide covering fire but, due to rough seas and the general confusion of the day, those that made it ashore arrived late. DD Shermans were also used in the Anvil landings in southern France (8/44) and in several river-crossing operations in NW Europe (including the assault across the Rhine in March 1945).</p>
<p><a id="49"></a><img src="amerv104.jpg" width="168" height="74" alt="AmerV104" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">49. LVT2:</span> The LVT (Landing Vehicle, Tracked) derived from an amphibious rescue vehicle called the Alligator, whose tracks were specially configured to propel it in water as well as on land. Designated the LVT1, it was unarmored since it was to be primarily used for the ship-to-shore movement of supplies. (For this reason it is not included in the game.) The great advantage of the LVT was that, in the PTO where many islands are surrounded by coral reefs that block the passage of boats, it could simply drive across the reef and continue shoreward. It also excelled in crossing soft or muddy ground. On the other hand, the LVT—and especially its delicate tracks—proved to be somewhat unreliable; in fact it was generally accepted that each hour of operation necessitated two hours of maintenance. The LVT1 and LVT2 also had another drawback in that only light cargo items could be carried since they had to be lifted over the vehicle's side to be unloaded. However, in spite of these deficiencies the LVT was one of the most important tactical innovations of WW2 and proved indispensable in PTO amphibious landings. Total production of the unarmored LVT2 was 2,963 vehicles, and it first saw combat during the Betio landings in the Tarawa Atoll. Beginning in July 1942, each Marine division was authorized an amphibian tractor battalion— within which a platoon comprised nine LVT (increased to ten in April 1943).</p>

Unfortunately, the extra weight ensuing from the use of armor decreased the LVT(A)2's payload capacity. The LVT(A)2 first entered combat in the Kwajalein Atoll landings with the Army's Provisional Amphibian Tractor Battalion.</p>

LVT4: To increase the carrying capacity of the LVT2, two new models were designed in 1943. The first to be used in combat was the LVT4, which had the engine moved forward from the stern to behind the driver's cab so that a manually operated ramp could be incorporated at the stern. This ramp allowed quick on- and off-loading, and even enabled the LVT4 to carry a small vehicle. (The LVT3, also known as the Bushmaster, was not used operationally until the landings on Okinawa in April 1945 and is equivalent to the LVT4 in most game terms, so has not been included in the game.) As originally built, the LVT4 was armored only on the cab and ramp but most were modified by the use of bolt-on armor kits and so are treated as AFV in the game. 8,348 LVT4 were built, making them the most numerous LVT type during WW2. They first saw action during the Saipan landings. The LVT2 and (A)2 were nicknamed &quot;Water Buffalo&quot;, while all LVT were referred to generically as &quot;amtracs&quot; (amphibious tractors) or &quot;alligators&quot;. More than 18,600 LVT of all types were produced during WW2.</p>
<p><img src="amerv110.jpg" width="368" height="417" alt="AmerV110" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />†The AAMG FP actually consists of three AAMG: one .50-cal HMG (MA; 6 FP), and two secondary .30-cal MMG (4 FP each). This is signified by &quot;MA: 12.7&quot; and &quot;6MA&amp;4&amp;4&quot; on the counter. The MA AAMG may fire only at a target that lies within the VCA, but the secondary AA-MMG may not fire thusly within the VCA [EXC to both: during CC]. One secondary AA-MMG may fire at a target that lies between one border of the VCA and the hexspine-defined centerline of the &quot;rear&quot; VCA, while the other secondary AA-MMG may fire in like fashion but only on the &quot;other side&quot; of the LVT. See the accompanying diagram and <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#h" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note H</a>.</p>
<p>†PTO RF is 1.4 for 6-9/44, 1.2 for 10-12/44, and 1.0 for 1-6/45. ETO Dates and RF are 1-5/45 and 1.5.</p>
<p>†PASSENGERS: The ramp on the LVT4 enabled it to carry a vehicle/Gun as well as Personnel, making special rules necessary for their transport. Such a Passenger-Gun/vehicle (including the latter's PRC) may not attack in any way. An LVT4 must be CE to (un)load any type of Passenger(s). In addition, if an LVT4 has (un)loaded any Passenger(s) during the current MPh, its rear Target Facing is treated as unarmored vs all Defensive First Fire attacks that can affect it through that Target Facing.</p>
<p>PP CAPACITY: The LVT4 may transport any combination of the following items, with the total indicated PP applying to the LVT's PP Capacity (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>).</p>

<p><span class="f_Exponent">1</span>: As per <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a> (i.e., 4 PP for a Gun of ≤ 99mm, or 8 PP for one ≥ 100mm). This applicable PP cost is also used for a dm 76-82mm MTR, as well as for a 107mm mortar.</p>
<p><span class="f_Exponent">2</span>: As per their normal Passenger/Rider PP cost.</p>
<p><span class="f_Exponent">3</span>: EXC: the PP cost of units/SW/ammo are reduced to zero if they are Passengers of a vehicle that is itself a Passenger.</p>
<p>VEHICLE: Unloading a Passenger vehicle consists of driving it off the LVT4 into the LVT's Location at a cost of one MP for starting, plus one-fourth of the Passenger vehicle's MP allotment, plus COT. There is no MP cost for entering the LVT's Location (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.14" class="topiclink">D2.14</a>), but Overstacking will apply. Loading is the reverse of this procedure; i.e., the vehicle first enters the LVT's Location if necessary (paying one extra MP; <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.14" class="topiclink">D2.14</a>), and then expends one-fourth of its MP allotment plus one MP for COT to load onto it, plus one MP to stop. Otherwise, the normal principles of<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink"> D6.4-.5</a> for (un)loading Passengers apply, including the &quot;simultaneous expenditure&quot; of each 25% -segment of movement allotment by both the Passenger vehicle and the LVT4 during the turn of (un)loading. An allowed vehicle can (un)load while towing a Gun (unless using Reverse movement; <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>) by paying the extra MP for towing. A Passenger vehicle or Gun may not change its CA relative to that of its LVT. Since the LVT4's ramp is at its rear, a vehicle's VCA must coincide with the LVT's VCA (or &quot;rear&quot; VCA) so that the vehicle is properly aligned for forward or reverse entry/exit onto/from the LVT. Overstacking does not occur due to a vehicle's being a Passenger on an LVT4. A vehicle that is also a Passenger cannot claim or retain Motion status independently of the LVT4.</p>
<p>GUN: (Un)loading an unhooked Gun from/onto an LVT4 follows the same procedure as (un)hooking it from/to a towing vehicle (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">C10.11 &amp; .2</a>). A Gun may be (un)hooked from/to an allowable vehicle while both are Passengers on the LVT (any resulting TI status does not apply to the LVT).</p>
<p>SURVIVAL: If an LVT4 is destroyed (but does not burn) while on land, all unarmored vehicles and Guns aboard it are also destroyed; all vehicular PRC roll for survival using the LVT's CS#. If an AFV is aboard such a destroyed LVT4, repeat the original attack, using its Original DR but now vs the AFV and adding an extra +2 TH (or IFT for non-ordnance) DRM as well as all other DRM applicable to the AFV. If the AFV survives it is bogged but may freely unload in a subsequent friendly MPh if it first passes a Bog Removal DR. The AFV's PRC automatically survive the LVT's destruction, but if the AFV does not survive they must roll for survival using the AFV's CS#; if they survive they are placed on foot in the hex in the normal manner.</p>

DUKW:</span> In 1942 a requirement originated for a wheeled amphibious cargo carrier that could land supplies directly on a beach and then proceed inland with them if necessary. The vehicle ultimately developed for this purpose was a 2½-ton 6x6 truck that was transformed into a boat (complete with anchor) while retaining its wheeled drive. It was designated the DUKW (D = 1942; U=utility; K=all-wheel drive; W=twin rear axles) and was commonly referred to as the &quot;Duck&quot;. Water propulsion was via propeller, and steering was effected by the combined use of the front wheels and a rudder which were both controlled by the steering wheel. Over 21,000 were built. One vehicle in four was equipped with a ring-mounted .50-cal AAMG. The DUKW was first used in March 1943 during the landings at Noumea, New Guinea; against the Germans its initial use came in July 1943 when 300 were used during the invasion of Sicily.</p>

Propulsion in water was via an engine-driven propeller, and the steering wheel doubled as a helm controlling the rudder. Production of the GPA began in Sept. 1942, but the type never saw widespread service as only about 6,000 were built. Various nicknames were applied to the amphibious Jeep; among them were &quot;Seep&quot;, &quot;Waterbug&quot;, and &quot;Duckling&quot;. &quot;GPA&quot; stands for &quot;General Purpose, Amphibious&quot;.</p>

Jeep:</span> By the end of the war 361,349 Willys MB had been built, as well as 277,896 Ford GPW, for a total of 639,245 standardized Jeeps. The name &quot;Jeep&quot; is said to have derived from the &quot;GP&quot; (General Purpose) designation used by Ford; however, the vehicle's official name was &quot;Truck, ¼-Ton, 4X4, Utility&quot;. During the early war years it was often also referred to as the &quot;Peep&quot; (while &quot;Jeep&quot; was used for the ½-ton Dodge truck). Aside from its many command, liaison, etc., roles the Jeep was also standard equipment in the mechanized cavalry recon platoon from mid 1943 on. Each such platoon consisted of an armored car section, and a scout section that contained six Jeeps (three with a mounted MG and three with a 60mm mortar apiece). In addition, a 1944-45 TD battalion included one (if towed) or three (if SP) recon platoons, each of which contained five Jeeps (four with MG) as well as two M8 Armored Cars.</p>

The game piece also represents the older ½-ton truck which was used in the same roles but was phased out when the ¾-ton versions became available in the latter half of 1942. About 82,000 ½-ton and 267,000 ¾-ton trucks were built—all by Dodge.</p>

Although 428,196 of the 1½-tonner had been built by 1945, it was largely superseded in the cargo-carrying role in U.S. units by the more versatile 2½-tonner; consequently many were built with specialized bodies and fittings for use by the Signal Corps, engineers, etc. The 1½-tonner was not used by the Marines.</p>

The 2½-tonner had various nicknames such as &quot;Deuce and a half&quot;, &quot;Jimmy&quot;, &quot;Eager Beaver&quot;, and &quot;Workhorse of the Army&quot;.</p>

Three of the more common vehicles in this category were the Diamond-T 4-Ton 6x6 (used for, among other things, towing the 155mm howitzer and 4.5-in. gun), the 6-Ton 6x6 (used for towing heavy AA guns), and the Mack NO 7½-Ton 6x6. However, for simplicity only the latter is used in the game to represent its class. The Mack 7½-tonner was used as a prime mover for the 155mm gun and the 8-in. howitzer. A low production priority for heavy-heavy trucks during the early war years resulted in their being rather rare, especially in the 1943-44 period. 154,686 heavy-heavy trucks were built during WW2.</p>
<p>†RF is 1.4 through 6/43; 1.5 for 7/43-44; and 1.4 in 1945.</p>
