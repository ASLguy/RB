<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">U.S. MULTI-APPLICABLE VEHICLE NOTES</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="a"></a><span class="f_Strong">A.</span> &nbsp;APCR is not available in Italy or in the PTO (as signified by &quot;E&quot; in the Depletion number if the vehicle is available in the PTO). &quot;A4&quot; stands for &quot;August 1944&quot;, the date when this ammo becomes available.</p>
<p><a id="b"></a><span class="f_Strong">B.</span> Due to two of the MG that constitute the BMG FP being in fixed mounts and fired remotely, this BMG receives a +1 DRM to all fire at a moving/Motion target. This penalty is signified on the counter by a white dot over the BMG factor.</p>
<p><a id="c"></a><span class="f_Strong">C.</span> 37mm canister has 12 FP, and is available in all theaters but only after 7/42—as signified by the superscript &quot;A2+&quot; (&quot;August 1942 on&quot;) on certain counters. 75mm canister has 20 FP, and is available in 1944-45 but not in Italy. 105mm canister has 24 FP, and is available in 1944-45 but only in the PTO. Printed canister Depletion numbers are increased by three for use in the PTO unless the superscript &quot;p&quot; is present to indicate that canister is available only in the PTO; e.g., &quot;C7&quot; becomes &quot;C10&quot; when used in the PTO, but &quot;C7P&quot; is used as &quot;C7&quot; and only in the PTO. For the M3 Medium Tank, canister is available only to the 37LL MA—as signified by &quot;C537&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="d"></a><span class="f_Strong">D.</span> The vehicle's high hull made exit and entry difficult for Personnel who had to climb over the sides. Therefore, the costs to (un)load (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">D6.4-.5</a>) are doubled to ½ of the vehicle's MP allotment and two MF for the Personnel—as signified by &quot;(un)loadx2&quot; on the counter [EXC: normal costs apply to the LVT4]. In addition, all attacks made by the Passengers of this vehicle are halved (or receive a +2 TH DRM) as Mounted Fire (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>). This vehicle can retain any unpossessed SW aboard it (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">D6.4</a>), and its crew may Remove its MG armament (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>).</p>
<p><a id="e"></a><span class="f_Strong">E.</span> &nbsp;The inherent crew may fire only the .50-cal MA unless it is malfunctioned or disabled, in which case the crew may fire a secondary AAMG instead. Otherwise, only a Good Order Passenger may use a secondary AAMG (as signified on the counter by printing such FP in red). If such a Passenger is a lone SMC, it can fire one secondary AAMG; if ≥ two SMC or a MMC, all secondary AAMG can be fired. Assuming they are properly manned, the MA AAMG and any/all secondary AAMG may be fired together as a FG or at separate targets (as per <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">D3.5</a> and within any applicable field of fire restrictions). Each red-FP AAMG fired by a Passenger counts as use of a SW for the purpose of also using that Passenger's inherent FP. See <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#h" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note H</a>.</p>
<p><a id="f"></a><span class="f_Strong">F.</span> &nbsp;This AFV may be equipped with a bow-mounted SA FT instead of a BMG—but only by SSR. For DYO purposes (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">H1.41</a>) use the rules below to determine if this tank is so equipped; note that the DR mentioned below are actually Availability DR.</p>
<p>LT: If the AFV is a Light Tank (as per Vehicle Listing), it has a FT if its owner makes a DR of 2 (for a 7/44-45 scenario in the ETO) or ≤ 4 (for a 1944-45 scenario in the PTO). This FT has 24 FP, Normal Range of 1, and X10.</p>
<p>MT: If the AFV is a Medium Tank it has a FT if the scenario date is 7/44-45 and the owner makes a DR of 2 (for an ETO scenario), or ≤ 4 (for a 7-12/44 scenario in the PTO), or ≤ 5 (for a 1945 scenario in the PTO). This FT has 30 FP, Normal Range of 1, and X10.</p>
<p><a id="g"></a><span class="f_Strong">G. </span> May be equipped with a Gyrostabilizer as per <a href="chd_chd11.htm" class="topiclink">D11</a>.</p>
<p><a id="h"></a><span class="f_Strong">H.</span> Each AAMG malfunctions and is repaired or disabled independently of the others. If a vehicle's MA AAMG malfunctions, mark it with a &quot;MA Malfunction&quot; counter to show that its non-MA AAMG FP is still usable. Whenever all of a vehicle's non-MA AAMG malfunction, indicate this by using an &quot;AAMG Malfunction&quot; counter. If a vehicle has more than one non-MA AAMG and one of them malfunctions, mark the vehicle with a &quot;One AAMG Malfunction&quot; counter; thereafter, in each friendly fire phase in which that AAMG is not repaired, the remaining still-usable non-MA AAMG may fire in its own allowed direction or in the malfunctioned AAMG's direction at no extra penalty. [EX: An LVT4's &quot;port-side&quot; AAMG malfunctions. As long as that AAMG is not repaired, the &quot;starboard-side&quot; AAMG can be used in either AAMG's side-rear field of fire; i.e., its field of fire is then in any direction except through the VCA. See the diagram for <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#51" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 51</a>.] Since the ROF applies only to the MA (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">A9.2</a>), the owner must announce before he fires that he is using the MA if he wishes to possibly retain a multiple ROF. An Armor/Passenger leader may direct the fire of more than one vehicular-mounted/Passenger-fired MG only if those MG are firing together as a FG.</p>
<p><a id="i"></a><span class="f_Strong">I.</span> The AAMG FP actually consists of two MG: one .50-cal HMG (MA; 4 FP) and one secondary .30-cal MMG (2 FP)—as signified by &quot;4MA&amp;2&quot; on the counter. Each MG may be Removed as this given type (i.e., as a .50-cal. or MMG respectively).<span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> See also <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#e" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note E</a>.</p>
<p><a id="j"></a><span class="f_Strong">J.</span> While inherent armament of the halftrack, the mortar can fire only at a target that lies within the halftrack's &quot;rear&quot; VCA (i.e., the VCA emanating from its rear Target Facing)—as signified by &quot;MA:RVCA only&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="k"></a><span class="f_Strong">K. </span>The AAMG may not fire at a target that lies within the VCA [EXC: during CC]—as signified by &quot;MG:NA VCA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="l"></a><span class="f_Strong">L.</span> This vehicle has Low Ground Pressure (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">D1.41</a>). Moreover, when it is bogged, one (only) CX squad (even a Prisoner—but not a Guard) on foot expending a four MF in the vehicle's Location (and declared to be assisting its unbogging) thereby allows the owning player to subtract two (one per crew/HS) from the colored dr of <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> its immediately-subsequent unbogging DR. See <a href="chh_britishnotes_chhbritishvehiclenotes.htm#84" class="topiclink">British Vehicle Note 84</a>.</p>
<p><a id="m"></a><span class="f_Strong">M. </span>The mortar's range is 3-75 and can be Removed dm (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>). While Removed, its ROF, B#, and all other specifications conform to that of the U.S. Ml 81mm MTR counter, and the halftrack retains an Inherent Driver.</p>
<p><a id="n"></a><span class="f_Strong">N. </span>This vehicle was used in North Africa (Morocco/Algeria/Tunisia) at some time from 11/42 to 5/43 (within the limits of its own given Dates).</p>
<p><a id="o"></a><span class="f_Strong">O.</span> The AAMG is a .50-cal HMG if 4 or 6 FP, or a MMG if 2 FP—and may be Removed (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>) as such. If the MG is optional, its RF is 1.3 if 4 FP or 1.1 if 2 FP.</p>
<p><a id="p"></a><span class="f_Strong">P.</span> This vehicle was used by U.S. forces only in the PTO [EXC: if &quot;}&quot; appears, it was not used in the PTO by U.S. forces].</p>
<p><a id="q"></a><span class="f_Strong">Q.</span> The AAMG FP actually consists of three MG; one .50-cal HMG (MA; 6 FP) and two secondary .30-cal MMG (4 FP each)—as signified by &quot;MA: 12.7&quot; and &quot;6MA&amp;4&amp;4&quot; on the counter. These MG may fire together as a FG or at separate targets (as per <a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.5" class="topiclink">D3.5</a>). In all other respects they are treated as normal AAMG. See <a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#h" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note H</a>.</p>
<p><a id="r"></a><span class="f_Strong">R.</span> This AFV had a very fast and accurate turret traverse, and also a better-than-normal ROF for a MA of its caliber. Therefore, this AFV is allowed the possibility of Multiple Hits (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.8" class="topiclink">C3.8</a>) even though its MA is &gt; 40mm. Moreover, in a Gun Duel (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.2401" class="topiclink">C2.2401</a>) its total Firer-based TH DRM are halved (FRD) prior to adding any Acquisition DRM. (The final total of all DRM may not be &lt; zero, and applies for Gun Duel calculations only.) These abilities are signified on the counter by the ROF ft being printed on a white background.</p>
<p><a id="s"></a><span class="f_Strong">S. </span>Equipped with smoke pots (as signified by &quot;sP#&quot; on the counter) instead of a smoke mortar. See <a href="chd_chd13.htm" class="topiclink">D13</a> for usage. A crew must be CE in order to attempt sP usage.</p>
<p><a id="t"></a><span class="f_Strong">T.</span> The Bog DRM for ground specified as &quot;soft, mud, or snow-covered&quot; (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.21" class="topiclink">D8.21</a>) does not apply to an LVT.</p>
<p><a id="u"></a><span class="f_Strong">U.</span> Gunshield yields a +3 DRM against incoming fire through the AFV's front Target Facing instead of the normal +2 DRM for CE status. This is signified by &quot;CE:+3F&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="v"></a><span class="f_Strong">V.</span> Even though the CMG (or IFE, for the M16 MGMC) FP actually comprises more than one MG, it is treated as a single weapon for malfunction/repair purposes. Neither the MA nor CMG may be Scrounged or Removed—as signified by &quot;CMG [or MA] Rmvl NA&quot; on the counter. Neither the MA nor CMG may fire at a target that lies within the VCA and is also at the same or a lower level than the firer [EXC: during CC]. This is indicated on the counter by &quot;VCA ≤ level NA&quot;.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">[US Multi-Applicable Note V]: Can such a weapon (i.e., one that cannot fire in the VCA at the same level) attack in OVR?</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">A. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No.&nbsp;</span><span class="f_Highlight">[errata notes]</span></p>
<p><a id="w"></a><span class="f_Strong">W.</span> Reverse movement costs this vehicle four times its normal hex entry cost—as signified by &quot;REVx4&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p> <a id="x"></a><span class="f_Strong">X.</span> Any optional MG are available 7/44-45, with 1.1 RF. The BMG can fire while the vehicle is HD—as signified by &quot;BMG HD FP ok&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p> <a id="y"></a><span class="f_Strong">Y. </span>If the scenario date is after 7/25/44, and if SSR so specifies, this AFV is equipped with the Culin hedgerow device. For a DYO scenario set after this date the player may, if he wishes to use the Culin device, make a dr to determine its availability: ≤ 2 means all eligible LT, MT, TD, and SPA are so equipped: 3-4 means only eligible LT and MT are so equipped; ≥ 5 means no AFV are so equipped. One dr determines availability for all eligible AFV purchased for the player's OB. The BPV cost of the optional Culin device is five points per AFV having it.</p>
<p><a id="z"></a><span class="f_Strong">Z.</span> This vehicle starts each scenario carrying one BAZ of the latest model (signified by &quot;BAZ&quot; on the counter), which does apply to the vehicle's PP capacity (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>) when it takes counter form. (Thus it must remain inherent if the vehicle currently has no unused PP capacity.) In a single Player Turn the inherent crew may fire either the vehicle's normal armament or the BAZ (as per <a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.8" class="topiclink">C13.8-.81</a>). Otherwise, the BAZ may only be Removed (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.631" class="topiclink">D6.631</a>) by the crew or a Passenger (who can claim possession of it automatically), or Scrounged (<a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">D10.5</a>). These principles also apply to the inherent SW in the German SPW 251/10.</p>
<p><a id="aa"></a><span class="f_Strong">AA.</span> MA and CMG (if so equipped) have AA capability—signified by &quot;MA:AA&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="bb"></a><span class="f_Strong">BB.</span> WP7 and s5 become available in June 1944—as signified by the superscript &quot;<span class="f_Exponent">J4+</span>&quot; on the counter.</p>
<p><a id="cc"></a><span class="f_Strong">CC.</span> The vehicle if armed, has an Inherent crew and thus has a CS# instead of a cs# (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>).</p>
