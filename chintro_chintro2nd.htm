<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">INTRODUCTION TO THE 2ND EDITION</span></h1>
<p>This 2nd edition of Advanced Squad Leader Rules (ASL Rules 2nd edition) owes its existence to the fact that, fifteen years after the initial publication of the ASL Rules, the ASL hobby is still thriving, bigger and better than ever. Once the 1st edition was out of print, the 2nd edition became a necessity if the ASL hobby was going to continue to reach new players. The question then became what to change; merely reprinting the 1st edition was out of the question. In the past fifteen years, hundreds of clarifying answers and errata had been published, and numerous replacement pages had been issued. Much of this has been incorporated into the 2nd edition. Our intent has been to change the ASL Rules as little as possible, while making them clearer and cleaner. ASL works well and has stood the test of time. All ASL scenarios and campaign games will play the same with either 1st edition or 2nd edition rules. The only consequential new changes we are making concern the rules involving Wall Advantage and Bocage, which, despite one previous rewrite, still were unclear for too many players. We hope we have corrected that now.</p>
<p>Since publication of the 1st edition, several important chapters have been added to the ASL Rules by various modules, along with the complete orders of battle for the Americans, British, Italians, Japanese, Chinese, Marines and Early War U.S. forces, French, and Allied Minors. (The publication of Armies of Oblivion by 2001 will provide the Axis Minor guns and vehicles, and update their infantry orders of battle, essentially completing the core system.) The Chapter E Miscellaneous rules came in Yanks, the Chapter F North Africa rules in West of Alamein, and the Chapter G Pacific Theater rules were split between Code of Bushido and Gung Ho! The Historical ASL modules Red Barricades, Kampfgruppe Peiper, Pegasus Bridge, Blood Reef: Tarawa, and A Bridge Too Far each has its own chapter. Solitaire rules came in the Solitaire module. Most of these rules are not contained in the 2nd edition. Rather, they come the way they always have, as part of the module to which they apply. We have, however, included them in the Table of Contents.</p>
<p>Compared to the 1st edition, several significant additions are included in the 2nd edition. Foremost among these are the Chapter E Miscellaneous rules from Yanks. The Miscellaneous rules open up so many scenario possibilities that we could not resist including them in the basic rules set. With the inclusion of Chapter E in the basic rules, ownership of Yanks is no longer a prerequisite for many scenarios that utilize rules from Chapter E.</p>
<p>The Chapter K Squad Leader Training Manual is also included, both the first six days originally published in Paratrooper as well as Day 7 from Pegasus Bridge and Day 8 from ASL Journal Issue 2. The detailed, easy-to-understand explanation of the basic infantry and ordnance rules in Chapter K is a boon both to the new player, and to anyone trying either to refresh their skills or just gain a better insight into how these rules work. Also included are the Night (E1.) aid from Pegasus Bridge, the Offboard Artillery Player Aid from Action Pack #1, and the Overrun Flowchart from Action Pack #2. These acclaimed playing aids help take the mystery out of the rules for night, OBA, and Infantry vs AFV combat, sections that even experienced players stumble over sometimes. Included also as an optional rule is the Incremental Infantry Fire Table (IIFT) originally published in ASL Annual '89 and reprinted (along with its accompanying article &quot;One-Half FP Table&quot;) in Classic ASL. We prefer the classic structure of the official IFT, but do not want to ignore the following that the IIFT has gathered over the years.</p>
<p>Newly included also are the Chapter H vehicle notes for several of the German and Russian vehicles that were not included in Beyond Valor. Various rules in Chapters F and G and Chapter O (Red Barricades) modified the basic rules that went before; those changes are included in the 2nd edition rules. Similarly, some material in Chapter E has been moved to the DYO section of Chapter H. The Index has been significantly expanded and updated to include all the ASL Rules. Do not be surprised if the Index or Chapter H refers to a rules chapter that is not included here. Those other chapters open up whole new vistas for the ASL player, but they are not required to play the majority of ASL scenarios.</p>
<p>Much has changed since ASL was introduced 15 years ago. Back then Squad Leader was only nine years old, but the follow-on gamettes had already boxed that system into a corner. Advanced Squad Leader was necessary if the Squad Leader system was going to progress. Many players of the prior system were upset that those games were now superseded, with only the boards being usable in ASL. Others were disappointed that programmed instructions were not available for ASL. ASL did require both a considerable amount of money to acquire and a considerable amount of time to learn, but the past 15 years have shown that this was money and time well spent. The foundation laid in ASL was strong, well thought out, and flexible. The fact that we are printing this 2nd edition is a tribute to the elegance of John Hill's original Squad Leader design and to the hard work that Don Greenwood, Bob McNamara, and Charlie Kibler put into developing Squad Leader into ASL, and then building on that base. Those founders (and the company they worked for) are no longer involved in developing and producing ASL, but the system they built lives on.</p>
<p>In light of the many changes in the past 15 years, it is no wonder that much of what was discussed in the Introduction to the 1st edition is no longer relevant. (Much of that first introduction is still applicable, however, which is why we include it.) Original Squad Leader is out of print and cannot be considered a prerequisite for ASL. A simpler way of getting into ASL is needed, however, and we are devoting significant time and energy to developing an introductory ASL product that will be fun to play on its own and help ease players into the joys of ASL. Errata coupons are no longer included in the 2nd edition. After the two original errata coupons were redeemed for errata pages, subsequent replacement pages were all provided in subsequent modules. (Those first two sets of replacement pages for the 1st edition are available on our web site, as are all the published Q&amp;A and Errata for the 1st edition). All those replacement pages are of course incorporated in the 2nd edition. We haven't decided exactly how to disseminate any replacement pages for the 2nd edition, but Q&amp;A/Errata will be available both on our web site and in the ASL Journal (the successor to the ASL Annual).</p>
<p>Additionally, time has shown that the binder ring reinforcements suggested in the earlier Introduction are not the best way to preserve individual pages against frequent use. Polyurethane page protectors seem to be the most popular method. Finally, the chapter on postal play promised in that first Introduction never happened. Nor will it happen. Postal play went the way of the carrier pigeon with the advent of readily available e-mail. Now with accessible software supporting play over the Internet, even play-by-email is passe. Who knows what the future will bring? Don't expect a chapter in this area until things settle down, if they ever do.</p>
<p>With the publication of the ASL Rules 2nd edition, the rules just got a little cleaner and clearer. The future of ASL just got a little brighter now that the Rulebook is again available. Armies of Oblivion will come out in the next year, completing the core system by adding the Axis Minor guns and vehicles and updating their infantry orders of battle. An introductory version of ASL, including the complete ASL Rules on CD-ROM, is in the offing. In the meantime, work continues on various Historical ASL modules, historical studies, Action Packs, and Journals. We are thrilled to be bringing you all this. We look forward to many more years of ASL fulfillment.</p>
