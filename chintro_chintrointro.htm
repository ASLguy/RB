<p>ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER (hereafter referred to as ASL) is somewhat of a misnomer; the connotation of &quot;Advanced&quot; suggesting that which is more difficult. While it is true that ASL in all its depth may well be more detailed in many respects than the original basic game, it is our belief that it is far simpler in application than the whole of all its predecessor's parts. To the purist, ASL should play far more smoothly than even basic SQUAD LEADER. For ASL is more than just a compilation of that which has gone before (although reorganization plays a significant role in the greater playability of the game). Rather, ASL is a new game forged from combat trials of nine years of constant evolution as simulation gaming's widely acknowledged leader in its field. Veteran squad leaders will find that the system itself has changed in myriad ways and that rules and consequent tactics employed countless times in the past may no longer apply. ASL will require careful scrutiny by veteran and novice players alike; those expecting to use it merely as a handy reference book to a system already learned will be surprised by the extent of inherent change. ASL is a new game complete unto itself and entirely separate from its predecessors. Do not blend old and new rules. When you play ASL you should use only that which is included herein.</p>
<p>We have tried to keep to a minimum the vast amount of verbiage required to thoroughly cover such an enormous system by liberal use of abbreviations and elimination of such common caveats as &quot;unless specified otherwise&quot;. Readers should check the Glossary for the meaning of any unfamiliar term or phrase (the Glossary always defines/references any abbreviated or capitalized term) and keep in mind that any SSR always takes precedence over the game system. References to the Designer's Notes found at the end of each chapter are made in the form of footnotes to applicable rules. In this way, the historical relevance or design intent of a rule can be given in considerable detail without interference with the presentation of the rules themselves. Players should find it helpful in learning the game to refer to these Designer's Notes as they come to them. Thereafter, they need rarely be consulted.</p>
<p>Although we have spared no expense in illustrating these rules, certain practical limitations were adhered to. The player should be alert from the outset that all illustrations posed against the background of the full-color map-board lack the red and white symbology actually provided on many of the vehicle counters. Therefore, most vehicle counters depicted thusly will appear somewhat different from the actual counters but are still considered to represent the counters provided in the game system without variation.</p>
<p>ASL does not bear the burden of many of the initial design errors that plagued SQUAD LEADER and its progeny. Many cumbersome concepts of the original game have been removed to allow for a more detailed, yet simpler, handling of combat at this level. This, in turn, has allowed the deletion of entire rule sections whose main contribution to the old system was measured in terms of complexity and increased playing time. The scope of the game system has been narrowed to more manageable proportions, and one more in keeping with a game on this scale. Therefore, if a distantly recalled rule isn't found herein, it hasn't been forgotten, it has been removed! While this will doubtless cause consternation to grognards who find their favorite bit of rules trivia removed from play, the end result is that ASL plays smoother and is on a level more accessible to the majority of players.</p>
<p>Concentrate on what the rules do allow; not on what they don't specifically prohibit. For example, if a rule states that a MMC can perform a particular action, then only that unit type can perform it-don't think that several SMC can do it simply because the rules don't list that type as being unable to do it. Play by what the rules specifically allow or disallow, not by what they don't specifically prohibit. For example, rule C13.8 prohibits bazooka fire at a target two or more levels higher in an adjacent hex. The rules say nothing about firing a bazooka at a lower elevation target or at a target two or more levels higher in a non-adjacent hex; therefore such fire is allowed.</p>
<p>ASL is still a bit much for the uninitiated. Without the comforts of Programmed Instruction, the wealth of detail is likely to be too much for the novice. ASL assumes at least a working knowledge of the game system by the reader, so possession and mastery of basic SQUAD LEADER should be considered a prerequisite. However, for those who have ignored the warnings on the box and purchased ASL without first having played SQUAD LEADER, a special chapter will eventually be included to help the uninitiated through what must seem to them a maze of technical rules with a humorous, easy reading approach. If you find yourself overwhelmed by ASL, wait for the SQUAD LEADER TRAINING MANUAL Chapter to get a firmer grasp on the basic fundamentals of the game system, or purchase the basic SQUAD LEADER game and benefit from its Programmed Instruction approach.</p>
<p>ASL comes in only two flavors: a complete basic system, and optional rules which can be incorporated into the former by mutual consent. The list of Optional rules in the Index should be checked and agreed upon before choosing sides in any scenario. It should also be pointed out that ASL is not necessarily compatible with previously published scenarios. Although you may well be able to play such scenarios with ASL, we make no claims as to play balance, design validity, or completeness of such attempts. ASL is a distinct game in its own right and our design time was judged better spent with scenarios designed and playtested exclusively for this system. Therefore, when purchasing additional scenarios or modules for use with the ASL system, the buyer would do well to look for the distinctive ASL logo on the product to be sure that it has been designed and playtested for use with ASL rules and components.</p>
<p>ASL incorporates an update and improvement of no less than four major previously published games and several new ones in one package. Future additions to the system (such as Japanese ASL) will also be accommodated in this binder format as simple chapter additions or changes to the pages already present. Initially, we strove to include as many of the original components of the SQUAD LEADER series as possible to reduce the cost of the new game system to the established player. However, as development progressed and the game system continued to improve on its old foundations, it became increasingly obvious that nearly all the original counters had to be replaced. To attempt anything less would have been to resort to the type of &quot;patch job&quot; mentality that necessitated the need for ASL in the first place. It also would have been a constant source of confusion to players who had to face ordering and separating defunct counters from valid ones. Therefore, we decided to establish a firm foundation for ASL with an entirely new set of counters specially designed for the innovations of the new system. The only previously published components completely usable in ASL are the mapboards which can be purchased separately by mail. However, many old counters (such as the Target Acquisition counters) can be used unchanged in ASL and others (such as the squad counters) can be pressed into service for large DYO scenarios with only minor inconvenience. Players are urged to make ASL Module #1 BEYOND VALOR their first acquisition as it contains all the updated counters for two opposing nationalities as well as the informational counters needed to play the ASL game system. Those not wishing to purchase this module may mail-order the individual counter sheets therein as befits their own needs. A reduced illustration (front and back) of all such components is included herein.</p>
<p>The looseleaf binder format is a first for our company and acknowledges the ills of a constantly evolving system. Although we would like to say that this is the final word, experience has taught us that perfection is an elusive target and almost impossible on a scale this large. However, players should find it easy to augment any additions to ASL by posting them to the binder as new modules become available. Errata and changes, the inevitable miscreants of a system as rich in detail as this, may be cleanly incorporated into the binder by simply replacing obsolete pages with new ones containing both the old rules and the changes highlighted with a gray screen. Such modifications will be made available by mail at the specified date in exchange for the Registration coupon located herein as per the instructions printed thereon. Nevertheless, those anticipating frequent play would do well to reinforce the individual pages with binder ring supports which are available in most stationery stores.</p>
<p>Although ASL is not designed with postal play in mind, we have noticed the efforts of SQUAD LEADER enthusiasts in the past who have attempted to play it by mail. We still don't advocate postal play of ASL; the game system has too many phases to make the game easily played in that medium. However, for those so inclined, we will eventually provide a chapter on postal play suggestions so that all interested parties will at least have a common background when attempting to do battle through the mail. You will also find inside a chapter entitled DELUXE ASL which provides the necessary rule modifications (actually simplifications) for playing ASL on a mapboard scale roughly 2.5 times the standard size. DELUXE ASL allows the use of panoramic miniature figures with its 2.2&quot; hexes and, more importantly, it all but eliminates stacking and counter facing difficulties, thereby greatly increasing playability. DELUXE ASL mapboards are sold in boxed modules containing four 11&quot; X 27&quot; mounted, geomorphic boards and a pad of 10 specially designed scenarios.</p>
<p>By simplifying the game system and making it more accessible, we expect to issue new mapboards, scenarios, and a host of other accessories in far less time than in years past. For those who take the time to learn ASL, a lifetime of rich gaming experiences lies ahead. We have spared no expense in our attempt to make ASL the definitive tactical WW2 combat system.</p>
