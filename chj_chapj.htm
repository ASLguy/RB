<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1. &nbsp;MINIATURES:</span> Deluxe ASL easily accommodates the use of l/285th scale miniature figures. MMC figures can be stacked on top of SW/Guns to show possession and laid prone when broken.</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><span class="f_Strong">2. CONVERTING ASL RULES TO DELUXE ASL</span></p>
<p><a id="2.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.1 STACKING:</span> Almost no ASL rules are actually changed in Deluxe ASL; most are only reworded to account for the absence of stacking in the latter. The only stacking in Deluxe ASL is that necessary to show possession; i.e. a MG counter is stacked on a squad to show that the squad possesses it—otherwise they are merely occupying the same Location. Similarly, a Passenger stacks on a vehicle to show that it is on the vehicle, and a leader stacks on a floor level counter or beneath a Sewer counter to show which Location it occupies within its current hex. Otherwise, it is assumed to be at ground level.</p>
<p><a id="2.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.11 &nbsp;RANDOM SELECTION:</span> Rather than matching the lightest colored dr to the top unit in a stack (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">A.9</a>), the lightest dr is now said to affect the leftmost unit of the player in the Location, the darkest dr the rightmost, etc. Be sure to align applicable counters in an obvious left-to-right fashion or specify colors before making a Random Selection DR.</p>
<p><a id="2.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.12 POSSESSION:</span> Stacking is still necessary to show possession of a Gun/SW (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.43" class="topiclink">A4.43</a>). Rather than being the bottom counter of a stack, an unpossessed SW/Gun is simply left unattended in the hex—i.e., not part of any stack. A Gun in a stack is possessed by the Infantry unit in that stack regardless of which unit is on top. This allows the player to mark SW which have used their First Fire capability by placing a First Fire counter on them, while stacking the unit which has not yet used its own inherent FP on top of them—a choice which has to be left to memory alone in ASL (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.33" class="topiclink">A7.33</a>).</p>
<p><a id="2.13"></a><img src="flame.gif" width="62" height="63" alt="FLAME" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.13 FLAME</span>: A Flame which has been Hampered (<a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.71" class="topiclink">B24.721</a>) is placed beneath a PIN counter; otherwise a Flame is merely placed elsewhere in the hex for possible conversion to a Blaze during the AFPh.</p>
<p><a id="2.14"></a><img src="wire.gif" width="74" height="73" alt="WIRE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.14 WIRE:</span> Units which have successfully moved beneath a Wire counter (<a href="chb_chb26.htm#26.4" class="topiclink">B26.4</a>) should be placed in the same hex but not actually beneath the Wire counter. Units which have yet to move beneath the Wire must remain stacked on top of it. Multiple Wire counters may be used (all representing just one Wire counter) to prevent large stacks on a single wire counter if the counter mix permits.</p>
<p><a id="2.15"></a><img src="hmfile_hash_dfc64d5f.gif" width="72" height="72" alt="1S FOXHOLE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.15 ENTRENCHMENTS:</span> Units inside an entrenchment are stacked on the entrenchment counter; units not in the entrenchment are placed elsewhere in the hex (<a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.1" class="topiclink">B27.1</a>). To avoid stacking, treat all 2S and 3S foxhole counters as 1S foxholes and allow placement of multiple entrenchment counters in the same hex to accommodate multiple occupying units (counter mix permitting).</p>
<p><a id="2.16"></a><img src="pillbox135.gif" width="74" height="76" alt="PILLBOX135" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.16 PILLBOX:</span> Units in a pillbox are stacked on top of the pillbox (<a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.2" class="topiclink">B30.12</a>); units outside a pillbox are placed elsewhere in the hex. More than one pillbox may set up in the same hex provided each has a different CA.</p>
<p><a id="2.17"></a><img src="britconceal.gif" width="60" height="59" alt="BRITCONCEAL" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.17 CONCEALMENT:</span> One &quot;?&quot; counter may still conceal all units in the same Location. Units may be stacked at start to accommodate concealment and then later separated, each under its own &quot;?&quot; counter.</p>
<p><a id="2.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.2 PLACEMENT:</span> There is sufficient room in each hex so that the position of a counter in the hex relative to its hexsides can impart information making some information counters unnecessary.</p>
<p><a id="2.21"></a><img src="ca.gif" width="63" height="62" alt="CA" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.21 FIELD OF FIRE:</span> Once a MG/Gun in woods, rubble, or building terrain has fired and thus limited its Field of Fire (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">A9.21</a> &amp; <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.11" class="topiclink">C5.11</a>) for the remainder of that phase, it should be placed in the hex so that it actually touches the hexspine that is the base for its CA rather than placing a CA counter. Return all such MG/Guns to the interior of the hex at the end of that phase.</p>
<p><a id="2.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.22 CA:</span> Guns must still be placed in the hex with their barrels pointing towards a hexspine to define their current CA, but should be placed approximately ¼&quot; away from the hexspine so as not to be confused with Guns having set Fields of Fire.</p>
<p><a id="2.23"></a><img src="resid4.gif" width="59" height="60" alt="RESID4" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.23 RESIDUAL FP:</span> Fire at a unit using Bypass leaves Residual FP only on that particular hexside. The Residual FP counter is left on, but inside, the actual hexside traversed and affects only units moving along that particular hexside or through the hex obstacle without using Bypass.</p>
<p><a id="2.3"></a><img src="cc.gif" width="58" height="62" alt="CC" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.3 CC:</span> Units do not have to be stacked with enemy units to engage in CC (<a href="cha_cha11.htm" class="topiclink">A11</a>), they merely have to occupy the same Location. However, if actually stacked with enemy units, Hand-to-Hand CC rules apply. This is one of the few rules which varies from that of ASL and it applies only to Infantry/Cavalry vs Infantry/Cavalry situations.</p>
<p><a id="2.31"></a><img src="hthmelee.gif" width="60" height="62" alt="HTHMELEE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.31 HAND-TO-HAND CC:</span> Hand-to-Hand CC can be declared only by the ATTACKER and only if his involved unit(s) has not been Ambushed (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">A11.4</a>) this turn, but once declared affects all units of both sides as long as that Melee exists in that Location. When Hand-to-Hand CC is declared in a Location, all Infantry/Cavalry in that Location must be physically stacked together, but attack/defend normally. Any vehicle/PRC in the same Location can attack/defend in the same CC but uses the black Kill Numbers rather than the red ones. Hand-to-Hand CC uses the red Kill Numbers on the CCT. A berserk ATTACKER must [EXC: if Ambushed] declare Hand-to-Hand CC vs an Infantry/Cavalry defender. Hand-to-Hand CC cannot be declared by or vs vehicles/pillbox-occupants.</p>
<p><a id="2.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.4 SINGLE-STORY HOUSES:</span> Any building depiction not containing a hex center dot or stairwell symbol is considered a level one obstacle to LOS regardless of the height of other building depictions in the same hex.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Board aI1 contains a level 2½ building obstacle, but any LOS through the smaller outbuilding in all (which does not also cross the main building depiction) has to deal only with a level 1 obstacle.</span></p>
<p><a id="2.5"></a><img src="ffe1blue.gif" width="73" height="73" alt="FFE1BLUE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.5 BOMBARDMENT:</span> In Deluxe ASL, Bombardment rules (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.81" class="topiclink">C1.81</a>) are altered as follows: the potentially affected area includes all the hexes of any four contiguous Deluxe ASL map-boards. The firer makes three dr per board and treats any 6 dr as No Effect.</p>
<p><a id="2.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.6 AFV CARDS:</span> AFV cards aid players in keeping battlefield inventory of the varied weapon systems of each individual AFV in his command. Each card is presented with an enlarged line drawing of the AFV, nationality symbol, and full listing of that particular AFV type's characteristics, including notes and special rules. AFV cards are not a replacement for the counters, but are an accessory for their use. One AFV card allows a player to keep track of the armament, ammunition, Schuerzen, and Armor Leaders of up to six vehicles of that type. Each card is designed to provide status tracks for each variable characteristic of the AFV, but only those applicable to that AFV (e.g., optional AAMG are available on only certain AFV). Besides being a reference for the capabilities of these AFV, use of the cards allows players to dispense with placement of the pertinent status counters on the board where they add to piece density. All of the common AFV of the German, Russian, American, and British OB were previously available on AFV cards. Plans are underway for making them available again in their previous form or as downloadable PDF files from our website at <a href="http://www.multimanpublishing.com" class="weblink">www.multimanpublishing.com</a>.</p>
