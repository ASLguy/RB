<p>FALL IN! Line up with your toes touching that white line. You, get rid of that gum! You, suck in that gut! Chin up, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. Try to look a little like soldiers. Alright—at ease.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, welcome to Camp Avalon Hill. How are you this fine June morning? Fine, I trust. I am your Drill Instructor, Sergeant Stahler. You are all volunteers here for the ASL Basic Training course. This course will challenge you; it won't be any game of checkers. We will practice the basic fundamentals of combat on a game board until it becomes second nature. When—and if—you finish you will be able to command Infantry in combat. The best of you will be qualified to go on to Advanced Training where you will learn how to use every Infantry weapon, call in artillery, and even coordinate air support. You will become familiar with every fighting vehicle from a jeep to a Tiger tank. You will learn to cross rivers without paying the toll, sneak beneath city streets via sewers, climb mountains, and jump out of airplanes. But that is in the future. For now, you will learn how to vicariously survive on the gameboards of ASL in WW2, and in the process you will learn to lead Infantry, to close with and destroy the enemy. You will become the backbone of the army; you will become Squad Leaders.</p>
<p>Today you will learn how to march. Fall in on the big yellow &quot;1&quot; in your 7-4-7 uniforms in five minutes (freely translated, that means punch out the Sgt. Stahler 8-1 and 7-4-7 squad AA counters and put them in hex B8 on board 1—and prepare to follow along).</p>
<p><img src="brd1.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd1" style="border:none" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p><img src="747+8-1.gif" width="126" height="62" alt="747+8-1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Inasmuch as there are twelve of you clowns, you will be collectively referred to as squad AA and represented by that Multi-Man Counter (MMC) (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.12" class="topiclink">A1.12</a>) with the picture of three soldiers. I, on the other hand, being of much more value, am represented by this fine 8-1 marker with my name on it. This is known as a Single-Man Counter (SMC) (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.11" class="topiclink">A1.11</a>). If you pass this course—God help us—you too can aspire to such lofty status. In the meantime, note the differences and follow the progress of our respective counters on your copy of board 1. And get used to the abbreviations. We use a lot of them in ASL and you better pick up on the jargon fast, because I don't like to repeat myself. If at anytime you don't understand a term I use, look it up in the ASL <a href="index.htm" class="topiclink">index</a>.</p>
<p>At ease. Unlike your soft, civilian life, the world of a Squad Leader is divided into hexagons. Every hexagon has six hexsides, which separate it from its six adjacent hexagons. Every hexagon also has a white dot or square in the center where I am now standing, and an alphanumeric code consisting of a letter and number, as you can see behind me. We are in hex B8 of board 1, simply referred to as 1B8. By citing the board number and code (otherwise known as a grid coordinate), you can locate any position in any situation. Henceforth we will refer to hexagons as hexes.</p>
<p>YOU! Stop checking your eyelids for holes. You will learn to operate with little sleep, especially at work the day after a tough battle. Pay attention. What hex are we in? &quot; 1B8, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What are the six hexes adjacent to us? &quot;1A8, 1A9, 1B7, 1B9, 1C8, and 1C9, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That's correct, but in the future refrain from including the board number in the coordinate unless we're referring to another board or it's been a long time since we checked our position.</p>
<p>Today you will learn how to march. Units move from hex to adjacent hex, expending Movement Factors (MF) as they go. TEN-HUT! ABOUT FACE! Forward MARCH. Hup, two, three, four. We just entered hex B9, expending one MF. Column Left, MARCH. We are now in C10, having expended another MF. Column Left, MARCH. We are marching through D9, expending our third MF. You don't have to march in a straight line; in fact, you can leave a hex in any direction, regardless of how you entered it. Column Right, MARCH. E10, F10. We are now in F10. Although F10 is only a Half Hex along the edge of the board, it is treated as any other hex. Of course, if you leave the board you vanish, never to be seen again. You will be considered eliminated or Missing in Action which is worse, unless specifically ordered to exit the board (<a href="cha_cha26.htm#26.2" class="topiclink">A26.2</a>).</p>
<p>Column Left, MARCH. We are now in G10 after expending six MF. Squad, HALT! We just passed through six Open Ground hexes, expending one MF in each. That is as many MF as you can expend in one Movement Phase (MPh) even while I'm with you unless you Double Tune and/or use Road bonus. Each player has only one MPh per Game Turn. &quot;What is a turn, sir?&quot; Don't call me sir, I'm not a *!#&amp;#! officer. I am a Drill Sergeant in Uncle Sam's Army and damn proud of it. You will address me as such in the future, or not talk at all. Is that understood? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Just as SQUAD LEADER terrain is divided into hexes a Squad Leader's time is divided into Game Turns made up of two Player Turns which are subdivided into phases. One Game Turn is equal to two minutes. At the end of the MPh of your Player Turn, you halt, and any MF that you haven't yet used are lost.</p>
<p>A MMC accompanied by a leader has six MF per MPh. You receive those extra two MF only if you move with a leader as one combined stack throughout the MPh. If the leader is pinned, wounded, eliminated, or otherwise forced to drop out of the stack, those two leader bonus MF are forfeit—although MF already expended cannot be lost. A SMC by himself also has six MF, but a MMC such as you maggots—without a leader—has only four MF (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">A4.11</a>). Actually, Inexperienced Infantry has only three MF, but they tell me you blockheads are officer material— God help us—so we'll spare you that indignity. In fact, you have the extreme good fortune to be part of our airborne forces and will be represented throughout this training by a 7-4-7 elite squad counter. Try not to disgrace the uniform too much.</p>
<p>See those trees in front of you in hexes G9, H9 and H10? They indicate woods hexes. Naturally, the going is slower through woods. I doubt whether there are any Tarzans among you. The MF cost of a hex represents how long it takes to pass through it. It costs two MF to enter a woods hex, as you will see. Forward, MARCH. We just expended two MF to enter H9. Column Right, MARCH. We spent one MF to enter I10 for a total of three MF expended so far. Column Left, MARCH. We expended two more MF to enter J9; a total of five MF. Column Right, MARCH. We expended our sixth MF to enter K10. Squad HALT! This MPh we expended all six MF but went only four hexes, because two of those hexes were woods hexes. Left FACE. See the building two hexes away in M9? Going through a building is as slow as going through woods; it also costs two MF per hex. Let's start a new turn.</p>
<p>Forward, MARCH. L9 costs one MF, M9 costs two more, and N8 costs one MF for a total of four MF expended so far. Column Left, MARCH! N7 costs one. Column Right, MARCH! O7 also costs one MF, even though we moved along the road. Squad, HALT!</p>
<p>You will note that crossing a road or moving along a road is the same as moving through Open Ground. A road doesn't speed you up much if you are on foot If you spend your entire turn moving along a road you get an extra MF (<a href="chb_chb3.htm#3.4" class="topiclink">B3.4</a>). We will now march directly to U4 along the road. Sing out the coordinate of each hex as we enter it. Forward, MARCH. &quot;P6, Q7, R6, S6, T5, U5, U4.&quot; Squad HALT! We just marched seven hexes in one turn, because we stayed on the road the whole turn. How many hexes can a squad move along a road by itself in one turn? &quot;Five, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How many hexes can a leader move along a road by himself? &quot;Seven, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>Now that we are in U4, observe the buildings. The one on your right in V4 is wooden because it is brown. The gray buildings in front of you in U3 and to your left in T4 are stone. Both building types affect movement in the same way, but the stone buildings offer better protection when fired upon.</p>
<p><img src="lvl1.gif" width="74" height="70" alt="LVL1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Buildings also have different heights. The V4 building has only a ground level because it consists of only one hex and has no stairwell symbol (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.2" class="topiclink">B23.2</a>)—which is a white square where the center dot should be. The T4 building has both a ground and a first level because it is a multi-hex building without a stairwell symbol (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.22" class="topiclink">B23.22</a>). However, it has an inherent stairwell in each hex, which you can use to go up or down stairs. Building U3, which has a stairwell symbol, has a ground level, a first level, and a second level (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.23" class="topiclink">B23.23</a>) in this type of building. You can go up or down stairs only in a hex with a stairwell. You use a level counter to indicate the level you are on by placing it beneath your own counter. The gray side indicates first level, and the yellow side indicates second level. Going up or down stairs costs one MF for each level changed. It still costs two MF to enter a building hex, even if you are staying within the same building. When I refer to a multi-hex building such as T4 or U3,1 am naming it by using the coordinate of just one of its component hexes. S5 is part of building T4, but you'll never see it referred to as building S5-T4. It will always be called building S5 or building T4. Even though only one hex is referred to in the name, all contiguous, directly connecting building hexes are part of the same building. Therefore, the terms &quot;building&quot; and &quot;building hex&quot; are quite different. If, to win a scenario, you must control building hex U3—you need control only that hex, including all its building levels. However, if you must control building U3—you must control hex U3 plus hexes T2, U2, and V2 (and all their building levels) as well. Follow me through building T4.</p>
<p>We enter T4 at the ground level at a cost of two MF. Then we use the inherent staircase to go up to the first level, costing one more MF. Here's that gray Level 1 counter. Moving to S5 costs two more MF (and our recently acquired Level 1 counter tags along beneath us so we don't have to bother with finding a new one), bringing our total expended thus far to five, and the MPh ends when we remove our level 1 counter to go downstairs to the ground level of S5, expending a total of six MF. Of course it would be quicker to go directly from T4 to S5 on the ground level, costing only two MF, but you would miss the beautiful view from the first level.</p>
<p>Now let's head to X5. Sing out the coordinates as you go. Forward MARCH! &quot;T5, U6, V6, W6, X5.&quot; That took six MF, four for Open Ground, and two to enter X5. The next time we move, we'll use the stairwell to go upstairs. Expend one MF to reach the first level, one more to reach the second level of X5, two MF to move to W5, and two more MF to go to W4 where we again end our MPh. Now for your first exercise. You will proceed on your own from here to 1B2 in as few MF and MPh as possible. Since I have six MF per MPh, I will be waiting for you there. And don't forget to use the correct level counter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span>FALL IN! Those of you who did it in 27 MF and six MPh did well. You remembered to use the stairwell in X3 and the road bonus to move five hexes per MPh for three turns. Fall out for chow; fall in on the big yellow &quot;2&quot; on board 2 in one hour. DISMISSED.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span>TEN HUT!</p>
<p>Now you're going to get some real exercise. We'll be traversing walls, hedges, and hills. Forward MARCH! B7, one MF; B6, two MF. Column Right, MARCH. C6, one MF; D5, one MF. Squad, HALT. To review, how many hexes did we just move? &quot;Four, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How many MF did we expend to go those four hexes? &quot;Five, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What is the most MF we could expend in one MPh without using a road bonus? &quot;Six, Drill Sergeant.&quot; See, you don't have to use all of your MF, but those not used are lost. Next turn . . . see that wall in front of you? It lies along a hexside, between hexes D5 and E5. We are going right over it to E5. Help one another, give your buddy a boost. Now over the next wall to FA We just spent four MF, one for each hex and one for each wall that we went over. Stop griping, Martin. Sure we could have walked around the wall, but there will be many times when you'll have to go over them, and you have to learn how.</p>
<p>Follow me along the road. Forward, MARCH! Sing out the coordinates. &quot;E3, E2, F1, G2, H1, I2.&quot; Column Left, MARCH! &quot;I1.&quot;Squad, HALT! Well, whaddayaknow? More walls for us to practice on. Move over the wall to J1 and K2. How many MF did it cost to enter J1? 'Two, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong! &quot;Seemed like a hundred, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong, and this is no time to get tired; you are just beginning. It cost three MF; one for the wall, plus the usual two MF for entering the woods.</p>
<p>Now we will tackle a hill. This hill in front of you has three different levels, each one a shade darker than its next-lower level (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">B10.1</a>). Each hex is all at one level; the one containing the center dot. Right now we are at ground level. K3 is at level 1, K4 is at level 2, and K5 is at level 3. Moving to a higher level costs double what it would otherwise cost Move out up the hill. K3 costs two MF, K4 costs two more, and K5 also costs two MF for a total of six MF in this MPh. While you are catching your breath, enjoy the view. You can see a lot from up here, but you can be seen from all those places too. Watch out for the dark brownish-black, serrated hexsides. These are cliffs and run along the hexsides between K5 and the three bordering hexes of L4, L5 and K6. You can't cross cliff hexsides without using climbing techniques (<a href="chb_chb11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">B11.4</a>) that you won't learn in this course. For the time being, you can't climb cliffs at all.</p>
<p>Follow me downhill. Moving downhill is usually like moving on the same elevation; it costs nothing extra. K4, L4, M4. That last hex was tough; it cost four MF: two for the woods doubled to four because we were going uphill. K4 and L4 only cost one MF each because we were going downhill. Let's keep going: M5, two MF; M6, downhill for one MF; M7 downhill to woods for two MF; M8, one MF. That is six MF and ends our MPh. Now let's move directly to J9.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span>How many MF did that last MPh use? &quot;Five, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Correct. I brought you down here because I want to show you hex I9. It is unusual because it contains both woods and a building. The cost to enter hexes like this is equal to the cost to enter a woods hex plus the cost to enter a building hex; i.e., four MF (<a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.4" class="topiclink">A2.4</a>). Let's do it. Whenever you have multiple terrain types in a hex such as this, the movement cost and TEM of each is cumulative. The main exception is where you find brush and woods in the same hex; the brush is considered just an extension of the wood's undergrowth and therefore the movement cost is the same as entering a woods hex.</p>
<p><img src="hmfile_hash_cb09d5bc.gif" width="60" height="57" alt="MTR sw US" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Now I have a surprise for you; get the 60mm Mortar in the next room and bring it in here. No ... put it on top of your counter not beneath it. Possession of equipment is shown by stacking the equipment on top of the unit possessing it. &quot;Do we get to fire it, Drill Sergeant?&quot; No. You get to carry it, or, in military parlance, to portage it (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.4" class="topiclink">A4.4</a>). All MMC have an Inherent Portage Capacity (IPC) of 3. That means you may carry weapons/supplies worth up to three Portage Points (PP) at no cost to your MF allotment. If in any MPh you carry PP that exceed your IPC, your MF allotment for that MPh is decreased by one for each PP by which you exceed your IPC. This mortar and its inherent ammo boxes are worth five PP. So if you carry it out of here without me, how many MF will you have in this MPh? 'Two, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Your normal MF allotment is four and the mortar exceeds your IPC by two—leaving you with only two MF. If I move with you throughout our MPh, even if encumbered by my own portage, you still get the two MF bonus that a leader provides for a total MF allotment of four. However, as a SMC I can do even more for you. I have an IPC of one which, if I'm not using myself, can be added to any single Infantry unit with which I move in a combined stack (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.42" class="topiclink">A4.42</a>). So, if I accompany and assist you throughout our MPh, how many MF will you have? &quot;Five, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Your normal MF allotment of four, plus my leader bonus of two MF minus one MF for the one PP that is in excess of our combined IPC of four. However, I'm not feeling particularly helpful at the moment, so portage that mortar up the hill to 18 by yourself. I'm staying here.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't carry it that far, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why not? &quot;Entry of a woods hex in a higher elevation costs four MF and we only have two MF while carrying . . . er, I mean portaging, five PP. You'll have to help us.&quot; True, you can't portage it normally, but I wasn't planning on your doing it normally or helping you. An Infantry unit with at least one MF left after deducting all excess PP costs may declare a Minimum Move (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.134" class="topiclink">A4.134</a>), which allows it to move one hex even though it doesn't have the necessary MF to enter the hex normally. Of course, it's a bit strenuous—you will be both CX (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.51" class="topiclink">A4.51</a>) and pinned (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.8" class="topiclink">A7.8</a>) when you get there—but that won't prevent you from using another Minimum Move to get back down here in the next MPh. There is no need to rest until you lose the CX counter. Bring it back with you ... NOW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Welcome back. Wasn't that fun! Take a break.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, leave the mortar in the next room for the next class. &quot;What is this CX counter anyway, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Don't worry, I intend to show you soon. Its effects aren't permanent. You have already lost yours during the Game Turn you were on break. But, now I want you to go to hex T6 on your own in as few turns as possible. Remember that you have only four MF by yourselves. I'll be waiting for you there.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> FALL IN! You should have made it in exactly four MPh, possibly ending turns at K8 or K9, N8 and Q7. You essentially lost a MF in K8 or K9 because you had only one MF remaining before the end of your MPh, and since the next hex in your path (L7 or L8) cost two MF you had to forfeit your fourth MF and start fresh in the next MPh. This lost MF cannot be accumulated for use in a later turn.</p>
<p>Look down at the base of the cliff in U7. The ground down there is littered with shellholes. Shellholes slow down most vehicles, but Infantry on foot has a choice (<a href="chb_chb2.htm#2.4" class="topiclink">B2.4</a>). We can either walk around the shellholes for one MF and treat them as Open Ground, or we can use the shellholes as cover and expend two MF. Follow me to T7, calling out the coordinates. &quot;S7, R6, R7, S8, T7.&quot; Squad, HALT! That took five MF. Now let's move to U7 expending two MF, and over the wall to U8, for three more MF ending our MPh. Now, over the wall to V8 for three MF, and over the other wall and into the shellholes in V7 for three more MF. All right, you're wearing out my shellholes and my patience. March along the road to U2. &quot;U7—one MF, U6—one MF, V5, V4, V3, U3, U2.&quot; Since we avoided the shellholes by calling out a MF expenditure of only one as we reached them, the hex was treated as Open Ground (<a href="chb_chb2.htm#2.4" class="topiclink">B2.4</a>), and we even got the road bonus. Had we spent two MF to enter even one of the shell-hole road hexes, the road bonus would not have applied.</p>
<p>Now before you is a hedge. Like a wall, it runs along one or more hex-sides; this one between T1, U2, U1, and V1. You can distinguish it from a wall by its color.</p>
<p>The cost is the same as a wall. We are going to move to V1 the hard way, via U1. Forward, MARCH! U1 costs three MF, one for the hedge and two for going uphill (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">B9.4</a>); V1 costs two more MF, one for the hedge and one for the hex. Now follow me to S2. U2, one MF; T1, three MF; S2, one MF. Now go to BB5 on your own in as few MPh as possible. I will wait for you there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> It should have taken you three MPh: to X1 along the road, then Y2, Z2 uphill to AA3, and BBS, BB4, then uphill again to BBS. Take a short break and fall in on the big yellow 4 on board 4 in five minutes. DISMISSED.</p>
<p><img src="brd4.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd4" style="border:none" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Fall In! Board 4 consists of relatively open, flat countryside. Forward, MARCH! C8, D7, E7, F6. Column Right, MARCH. G7, H7. Squad, HALT! You see grain hexes on three sides of us in hexes G8, I7 and I8.</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask a question, Drill Sergeant?&quot;</p>
<p>Certainly. The only dumb question is the one that isn't asked.</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of crops grow in a grain hex?&quot;</p>
<p>What a dumb question! It can be anything; corn, wheat, barley, Cheerios. They're all treated the same. Think of it as generic grain fields. Does anyone know the MF cost of a grain hex? One is the cost when the grain is out of season, usually from October to March (<a href="chb_chb15.htm#15.6" class="topiclink">B15.6</a>). In April and May the plowed fields slow you down, and from June to September the crops themselves impede movement. Can anyone guess what the movement cost is? &quot;Two MF, Drill Sergeant?&quot; No, too high. &quot;1½ MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>Exactly—except from October through March, when neither the grain nor the plowed fields exist (<a href="chb_chb15.htm#15.6" class="topiclink">B15.6</a>). However, since it's June, you must have the full amount of MF to enter a grain hex. If you only have one MF, you have to wait until next turn (or your Advance Phase . . . but we'll get to that much later). Let's march through the grain field. Don't worry about the local farmers; this is government land and it's grown just to be trampled. Your tax dollars at work.</p>
<p>I7, 1½ MF; J6, 1½ MF; K6, 1½ MF; K5, 1½ MF. Squad, HALT! These six MF end our MPh. Now I want you to head to FF5 by yourselves, but not by the quickest route this time. Enter only hexes with a coordinate of 5; for example, L5, M5, N5 is your first MPh. Get moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> It should have taken you eight MPh with a lot of wasted MF along the way. Those who took more or less, try it again. The rest of you, take a short break and fall in on the big '3' on board 3. DISMISSED.</p>
<p><img src="brd3.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd3" style="border:none" /></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Fall IN! Board 3 has only terrain that we have already seen, but before moving on to board 24 where you will see new terrain types, we are going to review what you've learned so far. What hex are we in now? &quot;3B8, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How many MF does it take to get to E3, which is the peak of hill 547? &quot;Ten MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. Taking the shortest route in MPh as well as MF, I want you to go to E3, then to I7, and then proceed to the second level of N1. Then go to level 1 of R6, before proceeding to W6, and DD2 at the top of hill 498 where I will meet you. Move out.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span>You should have expended the following MF, and taken the following number of MPh:</p>
<p>B8 to E3: 10 MF, 3 MPh</p>
<p>E3 to I7: 8 MF, 2 MPh</p>
<p>I7 to N1 level 2: 12 MF, 3 MPh</p>
<p>N1 to R6, level 1: 17 MF, 4 MPh (using the road bonus between N4 &amp; Q8)</p>
<p>R6 to W6: 8 MF, 2 MPh</p>
<p>W6 to DD2: 11 MF, 3 MPh</p>
<p>Anyone who got all of those correct has done very well. There may be hope for you yet Take five and fall in on the big 24 on board 24. DISMISSED .</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p>At ease. Board 24 has a lot of terrain you haven't seen before, at least not in this course. I suspect that most of you have seen brush, gullies, and orchards, but rarely from a Squad Leader's perspective. Ahead of you in C8 is a valley. We are standing at ground level, or level 0. The bulk of the valley is one level below us, or at level -1. The gully hexes in the valley are at level -2. Behind you, in hexes B9, C10 and D9 is a gully. It is a relatively narrow slit in the ground which is referred to in ASL as a Depression. It is slow going, but usually allows you to move about out of sight of the enemy. The gully is one level below the surrounding terrain. What is the elevation of the gully behind you? &quot;-1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Very good. Now let's do some marching INTO the gully.</p>
<p>TEN-HUT! About FACE. Forward, MARCH! Entering INTO C10 costs us two MF. Column Left, MARCH! Staying IN the gully, D9 also costs two MF. Column Left, MARCH! We are descending into the valley IN the gully INTO hex D8 for another two MF. Squad, HALT! That ends our MPh. The cliff to our right prevents us from exiting the gully to E9. Follow me IN the gully. E8 costs two MF. Here again, cliffs block us from E9. There is also a cliff IN our gully hex which prevents us from moving directly to D7 unless we climb. Gully cliffs look somewhat different from hill cliff hexsides, but the effects are the same. Continue IN the gully to E7. There are more cliffs to our left. We can exit E7 along the gully in either direction, but what is our only choice if we want to leave the gully? &quot;E6, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What do you think you are—a mountain goat? Guess again. &quot;F7, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Nice guess. Ahead of us in F6 is a stone bridge over the gully. We are continuing IN the gully to F6 for two more MF which will end our current MPh. We can leave this gully hex by any adjacent hex, but we cannot move directly to the bridge without climbing. We must first leave the gully and enter the bridge along the road up there.</p>
<p>Follow me IN the gully. G6, two MF; H5, two MF. Squad, HALT! From here we can follow the gully either to the right to I6, or to the left to H4. I6 is a combination gully-woods hex. It costs two MF for the gully plus two more for the woods, for a total of four MF. H4 also costs four MF since brush costs two MF. To leave a gully and enter a non-gully we have to enter higher ground, which is just like going to a higher level hill hex as far as MF are concerned. How much does it cost to enter I5 from IN H5? &quot;Two MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why? &quot;It normally costs one MF since it is Open Ground, but it is doubled since we are going uphill.&quot; Outstanding. What is the cost to enter I6 from H5? &quot;Four MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="crest.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="CREST" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />IN most Depression hexes such as this, you can move/advance into what is called Crest status (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.9" class="topiclink">B20.9</a>) by expending two MF (or using your Advance capability). Crest status leaves you clinging to the edge of the Depression in a Depression hex at an elevation one level higher than when IN the Depression itself, and is indicated by placement above a Crest counter. However, you are always considered on one side or the other of the Depression—not both—as indicated by placement of the Crest counter so that the solid portion of the hexside depiction on the counter corresponds with the three hexsides you can directly traverse. A Crest counter must be placed so that the middle of its three hexsides does not align with a Depression hexside. Therefore, here in H5, Crest counters can be placed only on the H5-I5, H5-H6, and H5-G5 hexsides and have no effect whatever on the other hexsides. Back in G6, Crest counters can affect either the G6-G7 &amp; G6-H6 hexsides, or the G6-G5 &amp; G6-F5 hexsides. You can leave Crest status in the Depression across any of these actual Crest hexsides by expending an extra MF (or advancing normally). The only way to traverse one of the other hexsides from Crest status in the same or a different hex is to first return to the bottom of the Depression at a cost of two MF (or your Advance Phase capability). You can also enter Crest status in a Depression hex while entering the hex from a non-Depression hex by expending one less MF than the normal cost to enter that hex (or advancing into it), but the Crest counter must be placed so that the middle of the three hexsides it could conceivably cover coincide with the hexside actually crossed. Let's assume we're in Crest status here along the H5-I5 hex-side. How many MF would it cost to move to I5? &quot;Two MF, Drill Sergeant; one to leave Crest status along the Crest hexside and one to enter I5.&quot; Good. Since you were already at the same elevation as I5 while in Crest status, there was no need to double the entrance cost of I5 due to entering a higher elevation. How much to enter G6? &quot;Four MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why? &quot;Because we have to pay two MF to exit Crest status INTO the -2 level of H5 before entering G6.&quot; H6? &quot;Four MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding. Remember, Crest status can never be gained in a Depression containing a ford or bridge, nor along a hexside of that Depression which is also a cliff or a Depression hexside (i.e. a hexside through which the Depression is drawn). &quot;Drill Sergeant, is entering Crest status the equivalent of changing Locations in the same hex?&quot; Not quite. Crest status is still considered to be the same Location as the bottom of the Depression because, if a firer has a LOS to both, his fire can affect units both in Crest status and IN the Depression. However, for purposes of leadership and SW Possession, Transfer, and Recovery (only), each Crest counter is treated as a separate Location from the Depression and any other Crest counters therein. Now, let's move on to I6.</p>
<p>While we take a short rest IN I6, let's look around, Even though we are IN a gully, we can still see the terrain in ADJACENT hexes. To our right in I7 is a brush hex. It costs the same as woods to move through, but it offers much less protection in terms of stopping a bullet. You can see farther through brush than you can through woods (<a href="chb_chb12.htm#12.2" class="topiclink">B12.2</a>).</p>
<p>Follow me as we head through the brush to the road. I7, four MF; H7, one MF; G7, one MF ending our MPh; F6, one MF. Squad, HALT! We are now on the bridge that we were beneath IN the gully. The only way to enter or leave a bridge is across one of the two road hexsides. What are the only two hexes that we can enter from F6? &quot;E6 and G7, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding. Let's keep going across the bridge to E6, one MF; D5, one MF; C5, two MF (remember that we just went uphill, doubling the normal entry cost of the hex); C4, one MF; and C3, one MF—for a total of six MF which ends our MPh. Squad, HALT! Look over to D2. The ground dips and comes back up on the hexside between D2 and D3. The MF cost for such Abrupt Elevation terrain (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">B10.51</a>) is one MF to go down, plus the usual two MF to go uphill, for a total of three MF. Do it. D2, three MF; E2, one MF; F1, two MF. This ends our MPh since we just expended six MF. Let's continue on through the brush—G1, two MF. Squad, HALT!</p>
<p>Look down into H1. It is a crag hex full of rocks, boulders, and other debris (<a href="chb_chb17.htm" class="topiclink">B17</a>). It offers some protection but it slows you down to the tune of two MF per hex. Follow me into the valley again. H1, two MF; H2, two MF. Squad, HALT! From here we can continue IN the gully to D for two MF, or leave the gully by moving to G3 (two MF), or H1 (four MF), but not to I2 because of the cliff hexside. We can move to G2, but that involves going uphill two levels: leaving the gully for two MF plus (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">B10.51</a>) leaving the valley for two more MF. Instead, we are moving directly to H3 for four MF; two to exit the gully while moving to the level -1 valley plus (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">B10.51</a>) two more MF to enter the level -2 gully in H3. We will now continue IN the gully to H4 which is a brush-gully hex. How much will it cost to enter INTO H4? &quot;Four MF, Drill Sergeant&quot; Why? &quot;Two MF for the brush and two more for the gully.&quot; Outstanding. Let's get moving. H4, four MF; H5, two MF. Squad, HALT! We have been here before. This time let's leave the gully and follow the road. H6, two MF; H7, one MF; I8, one MF; J7, one MF; K7, one MF. Squad, HALT!</p>
<p>To our right is an orchard in L7. This costs one MF to enter, the same as Open Ground, but it offers a little more protection. Beyond it we will take a path through the woods and visit a small pond. &quot;What kind of trees are in an orchard, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Fruit salad, soldier. No, they look pretty young. I guess that makes them ours; infant trees. Forward, MARCH! L7, one MF; M8, one MF. Column Right, MARCH. L8, only one MF since it is a path; K9, one MF. Column Left, MARCH! L9, two MF. Squad, HALT! That is a pond on the hexside between us and M9. Unless you own a paddleboat concession on this pond, you cannot cross it. If you want to go to M9 from L9, you have to go the long way via either L8 or M10.</p>
<p>No swimming today! We'll skirt the pond and head toward town. Follow me up out of the valley to M10, four MF; M9, two MF; continuing directly into another MPh—M8, one MF; M7, one MF; N6, one MF; O7, one MF; P6, one MF; Q7, one MF. Squad, HALT! On your left in Q6 is a lumberyard (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.211" class="topiclink">B23.211</a>). It is equivalent to a single story wooden building. What is its MF cost? &quot;Two MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Cross the lumberyard to the road on the other side. Q6, two MF; Q5, two MF, Q4, two MF crossing the hedge. Column Right, and head out along the road: R3, S4, T3. Squad, HALT! On your right is a new type of building. From what we know of buildings, what can you tell me about it?</p>
<p>&quot;It is stone because it is gray, has a stairwell in each hex, and has three levels in each hex.&quot; Correct, but it is also a split level building (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.72" class="topiclink">B23.72</a>). Level 1 in U4 connects to the ground level of V3, and Level 2 in U4 connects with Level 1 in V3. The ground level of U4 doesn't connect with any part of V3 and you cannot move from Level 2 of V3 directly to U4. Let's enter the building. U4, ground level, costs two MF; up to the first level of U4, one MF; over to the ground Level of V3, two MF; leave the building and use the path to enter W4, one MF. Follow the path: W5, W6, V6, W7, W8, X8 for a total of six MF. That would have cost 12 MF without the path. A path aids movement through brush just as it does through woods. Follow me through the orchard in X9, one MF; to Y10, one MF.</p>
<p>That concludes our training on board 24 for today. You should now be able to handle any terrain you encounter in PARATROOPER, but to be sure we'll practice with a few exercises. How many MF does a squad have in one MPh? &quot;Four, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Move along the diagonal Hex Grain from Y10 to G1. Keep track of the number of MPh that it takes and the total MF cost. Take off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> It should have taken you exactly 32 MF and nine MPh. Now take the same route back to Y10.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> It should have taken you eight turns and 29 MF. Movement costs between hexes are not always reciprocal. Now move from Y10 to the road intersection at Y2, staying on hex row Y all the way.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> This was an easy exercise. Who got 12 MF and three MPh? All of you? Outstanding. Maybe there's hope for you yet. Move along the diagonal Hex Grain from Y2 to I10.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span>That should have taken eight MPh and cost 27 MF. If it took you 26 MF you probably forgot to descend a level in U4, because you were at Level 0 when you entered it from ground Level of V3 and still had to descend a level to -1 in the valley. You have passed your first test, but it was an easy one. Now, we'll do it again—but like soldiers instead of raw recruits. Report to 1B8.</p>

So far you clowns have barely worked up a sweat. Well, that is about to change. At ease. Has it ever occurred to any of you that if you can move four hexes strolling along by yourselves and six hexes when you pick up the pace due to my encouragement, how much ground you can cover if we actually run? Well, in the military we call that Double Time (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.5" class="topiclink">A4.5</a>) and you're about to find out all about it first hand. Right FACE. Forward, MARCH! Double TIME. Sing out the total MF expended as we go. C8, one MF; D7, two MF; E7, three MF; Column Right, MARCH! F7, four MF; G8 five MF; H8, six MF; I9, seven MF, Column Left, MARCH! J8, eight MF; Squad, HALT! Ah—an invigorating little jaunt. Now, how many MF do you have in Double Time, Nixon? &quot;Gasp—eight, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Correct, but only if accompanied by a leader or you become a SMC yourself. Double Time just increases your normal MF allotment by two, and only if you're not broken, wounded, or CX. Unfortunately, it reduces your IPC by one, but that's no concern to us today. &quot;What is CX, Drill Sergeant?&quot; It is that white counter you've been lugging on your collective backs ever since I declared Double Time. It stands for Counter Exhaustion (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.51" class="topiclink">A4.51</a>), which, judging from the way you're all wheezing, appears pretty accurate. We'll have to cart that counter with us everywhere we go until we fire in our next Prep Fire Phase (PFPh), or break, or begin to move in our next MPh, or end our next MPh—whichever comes first. Basically, this means that we're prevented from Double Timing during any two consecutive turns so—while we can keep moving—we can catch our breath and you track stars won't have a heart attack. Of course, other arduous tasks, such as advancing into difficult terrain (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.72" class="topiclink">A4.72</a>) or taking a Minimum Move (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.134" class="topiclink">A4.134</a>), can also cause CX and prevent Double Timing in the next Game Turn. &quot;Can we CX through more difficult terrain such as brush or woods, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Sure, I'll show you before we're done. Now, how many MF can we expend next MPh? &quot;Only six, Drill Sergeant, because we're still CX.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't look so pleased about it, trainee. Being CX can give you a real problem in combat. You'll have to add a +1 Dice Roll Modifier (DRM) to any attack you make and your opponent will qualify for a -1 DRM against you in Close Combat. I doubt whether you'll be smiling then. In general, you want to avoid being CX for a lot of reasons best explained in your advanced training, but there are times when CX status will be necessary. Okay, a turn has passed while we've been talking. Notice your CX counter is gone. Is there any way we can move more than eight MF during our next MPh—short of hauling you out of here in a truck? &quot;No way, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Sure there is—if we stick to the road we'll still earn the road MF bonus. I'll prove it to you. Follow me toward V4. Forward, MARCH! Double TIME.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Squad, HALT! Where are we trainee and how many MF did we use? &quot;Gasp, S6, gasp, 9 MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; See? Nothing to it. Okay, take a two-minute break to catch your breath and get rid of this CX counter. What if we were to start marching and had expended MF before I ordered Double Time again? &quot;The Inspector General would have to conduct an investigation into why all of your trainees died in the field.&quot; No, wimp! Assume you were no longer CX. &quot;You couldn't do it anyway because Double Time has to be declared at the start of a unit's MPh.&quot; That used to be right, but the brass has rewritten the book on this one. Now a unit can declare Double Time anytime during its MPh—but if it waits until after it has expended MF to do so—it gets only a one MF bonus and all the normal CX penalties apply. &quot;Why would anyone ever undergo those CX penalties for just one MF, Drill Sergeant?&quot; I'm glad you asked that. Follow me . . . Route Step—T5, one MF; U6, two MF; V6 three MF; W7, four MF, X6, five MF. RAT-A-TAT-TAT. We're under fire from a Machine Gun (MG) in Z6—what should we do? &quot;Declare Double Time Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. That gives us one extra MF, which is all we need to pay the two MF cost of entry into X5 where we'll be under cover instead of out in the open. All of a sudden being CX ain't so bad, eh? Don't worry, that was simulated fire—well over our heads—but in combat you won't have that luxury. Suffice it to say that you should know how and when to Double Time.</p>
<p>There is another way to get where you're going faster without expending so much energy—although it's more dangerous. Up until now when we've entered building/woods hexes we've done so rather carefully— going from room to room or actually moving through the woods. However, if you declare Bypass Movement (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">A4.3</a>) when you enter such a hex, you can move around the building/woods depiction at a cost of one MF rather than two MF for actually moving through the obstacle. This MF cost assumes, of course, the other terrain in that hex along the hex-sides in question is Open Ground, with no other applicable costs of entry into that hex. You are able to traverse the hex more quickly because you are skirting the obstacle rather than moving through it. &quot;What's the catch, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Ah yes, there's always a catch isn't there? In fact, there are several of them. You can only use Bypass in buildings/woods hexes and not in all of those, depending on the direction you wish to move and the availability of non-obstructed hexsides in those hexes. For instance, there is no way we can enter X4 with Bypass because it is an Interior Building Hex completely enclosed by building hexsides. We can use Bypass to enter W5 along the W5-W6 hexside because this hexside is not blocked by a building depiction. At this point we will be at the intersection (or vertex) of hexes W5, W6, and V5 at a cost of one MF. Let's do it. From here we can continue on into any of those three hexes at normal MF expenditures, or continue Bypass in W5 along the W5-V5 hexside at no additional cost. The latter will leave us at the W5-V4-V5 vertex from where we can next move into any of these three hexes at normal cost. Let's move to the W5-V4-V5 vertex as part of the same Bypass expenditure. .. how many MF have we used so far in this MPh? &quot;One MF, Drill Sergeant.&quot; So, as you can see, whenever you use Bypass you are at a vertex, which limits your next move to the three hexes of that vertex rather than having the more numerous options available to a unit considered at a hex center dot. &quot;Can we continue Bypass in W5 along the W5-V4 hexside, Drill Sergeant?&quot; We could if the W5-W4-V4 vertex were not obstructed by the building (which is a real close call on my map-board), but it wouldn't be wise anyway. Such continued Bypass to a third contiguous hexside will cost an additional MF. We would have been better off just using normal movement to enter W5 at the same two MF cost. &quot;Can we continue to use Bypass to enter V4 or V5, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Sure, provided that the first hexside Bypassed in those hexes is part of our current vertex. Also, remember that you can never use your last MF for Bypass; i.e., you cannot willingly end your MPh using Bypass. Even if you are forced by enemy fire to end your MPh in Bypass, you are considered to return to the hex center after all Defensive First Fire against you is resolved (A4.32-.33). So, unless we are broken or pinned, we can't end our MPh here at this vertex. If I want to end the MPh here without entering another hex, what must I do? &quot;Voluntarily break, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Been skipping ahead in the manuals, haven't you, Sylvester? No, you can only voluntarily break in the Rout Phase (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.41" class="topiclink">A10.41</a>), but next time I need a self-inflicted wound I'll keep you in mind. The answer is hardly so devious. &quot;Pay two additional MF to enter the hex we are already in, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Correct—but keep in mind that you are moving from a vertex to a hex center. Let's go inside W5. Squad, HALT! How many MF did we use in that MPh? &quot;Three MF, Drill Sergeant, but why would we ever want to use three MF to go one hex that we can normally enter for two MF?&quot; Do I have to run you past another hidden MG? No? Good, because I think some of you soiled your pants the first time. Let's suppose that when we turned that corner to enter the W5-V4-V5 vertex, a previously hidden MG in T4 opened up on us. It fails to affect us, but keeps its Multiple Rate of Fire (ROF). We can't end our MPh while using Bypass so we have to move somewhere. Don't you think it would behoove us to pay the extra two MF to regain the +3 Terrain Effects Modifier (TEM) of the stone building here in W5? The unexpected frequently occurs in combat and you've got to learn to deal with it.</p>
<p>And that, boys and girls, is the real danger of Bypass. While using it, you don't get the benefit of the woods/building TEM of the hex you occupy and you are also usually subject to an automatic -2 DRM for Non-Assault Movement in Open Ground (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.34" class="topiclink">A4.34</a>) if a firer has a Line of Sight (LOS) to you. In short, you are extremely vulnerable to enemy fire while in Bypass. Not only is the fire more lethal but Bypass can increase the opportunities for such fire because the firer has a choice of potential LOS checks to any of the vertices occupied in that hex, or to the hex center dot across any hexside you traversed. While it is true that Bypass can be used to advantage to avoid the LOS of a Known enemy, it is extremely dangerous to use in the proximity of a suspected, hidden enemy. An example is in order. Let's go over to the intersection in W2 and start our next turn from there. An enemy unit and a MG is in Z1. We certainly don't want to fight them from out here in the open so we must move. If we enter X2 normally at a cost of two MF, the MG can fire at us—conceivably twice if it maintains its Multiple ROF. However, if we declare Bypass along the X2-W3 hexside, the MG has no LOS to either vertex we'll traverse (X2-W2-W3 and X2-X3-W3) and cannot fire at us. Suppose however, that once we declare this Bypass move, a hidden enemy in T4 shows itself to fire on us? We'd be in sad shape because instead of the +3 TEM of the building we'd be subject to a -2 DRM for non-Assault Movement in Open Ground. The moral is that Bypass is a handy way to increase movement capability and can even be used to avoid enemy LOS upon occasion, but is mighty dangerous if you use it where an enemy can see you. Enough lecture. Where are we? &quot;X2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong. &quot;X2-X3-W3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Having used Bypass we are not in a hex but in a vertex of that hex. &quot;But we are also equidistant from the W3 and X3 center dots, Drill Sergeant.&quot; True, but every vertex position occupies a portion of one hex—the first hex referred to in its vertex coordinate (<a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.2" class="topiclink">A2.2</a>). We can't end our MPh here— let's go inside in X3 (two MF), and up two flights of stairs (two MF), and—oops, Double TIME into W4 (two MF). Put that CX counter on. Squad, HALT!</p>
<p>Where are we, trainee? &quot;W4, second level, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Looks familiar doesn't it? This was the starting point of your first exercise. It took you six turns to reach B2 from here. Now that you know how to Double Time and use Bypass you should better that time considerably. I'll see you there.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Still six turns, although the last one used only one MF. The distance and MF expenditure (27) were the same, but your ability to Double Time twice got you here sooner. Bypass didn't help you any because the road bonus and a relatively straight route made it unnecessary to leave the road. Had you not started out already CX from the previous MPh you could have used Double Time in the first MPh, which would have gotten you onto the road for Turn 2 and consequently an extra hex traversed due to road bonus. That would have gotten you to B2 in exactly five MPh. As it was, you had to end each MPh in X3 (ground level), R2, M1, F2, and C3.</p>
<p>Now that you've seen how to increase MF at the expense of vulnerability, let's see how we can do the opposite—decrease our vulnerability by sacrificing movement. Let's go over to the woods in C3. Assume we want to cross the street into the building in E4, but are afraid of being fired on in Open Ground while out in the street. We can declare a Dash (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.63" class="topiclink">A4.63</a>), provided we have enough MF to normally traverse the terrain and have not yet expended any MF in this turn. We can Dash from a non-Open Ground hex (such as C3) into the street (D3), and then directly into a non-Open Ground hex (E4) on the other side of the street, where we end our MPh. We give up some of our normal movement capability but get across the street to a position with a good TEM. If fired on while out in the street in D3, those firers who can shoot at us must halve their firepower due to the sudden way in which we cross the street, although the negative DRM for multi-hex movement in an Open Ground hex can still apply.</p>
<p>That's enough for today. Tomorrow, we'll visit the LOS Course in 1Z5. Squad, DISMISSED.</p>
