<p>At ease. Welcome to LOS Range 1Z5. Today you will learn about LOS (<a href="cha_cha6.htm" class="topiclink">A6</a>). Your LOS determines what you can and cannot see. This is important because it determines what you can and cannot fire at. If you can't see it, you can't fire at it. More importantly, it can't fire at you.</p>
<p>The basic principle of LOS is that you can see it, and it can see you, if there is no obstacle in the way. But there are plenty of things that can be in the way; buildings, woods, hills, etc. Look up the road along the Z Hex Grain. We are in Z5. What other hexes can you see? &quot;Z4, Z3, Z2, and Z1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. That's easy. You can see the wooden building in Z1, and fire into it, but you can't see the woods past it, because the building blocks your LOS. Similarly, you can look down the other roads to CC7 and V7, but you can't see beyond them to the center of DD7 or U8.</p>
<p>You can all see the building in Y5; it is in an adjacent hex. What other hexes of that building can you see? Obviously, you can't see X2, X3, X4, W4, or W5, but how about Y3, Y4, and X5? This is where the white dots in the center of each hex take center stage. To determine if there is a LOS between two hexes, stretch a thread between their respective center dots. If the thread crosses an obstacle depiction with the obstacle visible on both sides of the thread, that LOS is blocked. An obstacle in either of the hexes in question doesn't count (unless tracing fire to/from vertices of the same hex). Only obstacles between the respective firing and target hexes block LOS. Now you see that you have a LOS to X5 and Y4, but the building in Y4 blocks LOS to Y3. Only the actual depiction of a building/woods blocks LOS, not its entire hex.</p>
<p>You can see Z6. What other hexes of that building can you see also? &quot;Y7 and AA7, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why can't you see Z7? &quot;The building in Z6 blocks LOS, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. Can you see BB7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The building in AA7 blocks the LOS. Can you see CC8? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right again, even though the LOS passes through AA7, it doesn't pass through the building itself. Can you see AA3? &quot;I'm not sure, Drill Sergeant.&quot; This is a close one. The LOS barely cuts the corner of the building in AA4, but because the building is not visible on both sides of the thread the LOS is not blocked (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">A6.1</a>) . You can't see Y2, but Y1 is in clear view. Can you see FF5? Come on, don't take all day! Any LOS along an Alternate Hex Grain is easy—you just sight along the hexspines. You better learn to recognize the easy ones because in combat you can't afford to be wrong—the thread stays in your pocket until the fire is irrevocably declared. &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's go into a building. Enter Y8. It has a white square instead of a hex center dot, which makes it a stairwell hex. How high is this building? &quot;Two levels, although the building is a 2½ Level obstacle, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why? &quot;Because it has a stairwell, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What level are we on? &quot;Ground Level, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What other levels does the building have? First and Second, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. You were paying attention yesterday. Looking up the stairwell, you have LOS only to the level directly above, the first level in our case. You can't see a unit on level 2 of our hex, because level 1 blocks LOS. You can see hexes Y7 and Z7, because they are adjacent, but only the ground level. Levels 1 and 2 in those hexes are out of your LOS. You can't see Z6 and AA7 at all, because they are blocked by the intervening rooms of Y7 and Z7. Looking out of the building, you can see X7 but not beyond it along this Hex Grain and at this elevation. You can see through the X7 hex—to W5 for instance, because your LOS does not cross the building depiction.</p>
<p><img src="lvl1.gif" width="74" height="70" alt="LVL1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Now go up the steps to level 1. Yes, climb onto that gray level 1 counter (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.421" class="topiclink">B23.421</a>)—it helps you visualize where you are. You can now see both up and down the stairwell to all levels in this hex—other than the rooftop, which doesn't concern us at this stage of your training. You can also see level 1 of hexes Y7 and Z7, but not the ground or second levels of those hexes. You still can't see Z6 or AA7 at all, but you can now see past X7! When you or your target are higher than ground level, the height of obstacles becomes important. Small, one hex buildings that only have a ground Level (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.21" class="topiclink">B23.21</a>) are one-level obstacles. This means that they block all ground level LOS, but units on level 1 or above can see past them to Locations that are also at level 1 or above.</p>
<p><img src="lvl2.gif" width="72" height="72" alt="lvl2" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />You can see past the obstacle in X7 to the first level of hexes T4, S5, Q6, and even N3 among others. You can't see past S5 at this level, because that is a larger, two story house (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.22" class="topiclink">B23.22</a>). Multi-hex buildings without stairwells, which have both a ground and first level, are l½ levels high. You have to be at level 2 or higher to see past them. They block both ground level and level 1 LOS. Move up the stairs to level 2. Jump onto that yellow level 2 counter.</p>
<p>Now you have an excellent view. You can see not only past X7, but you can also see past S5 to the second Level of Q4. You can't see past Q4 because that is part of a multi-story building (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.23" class="topiclink">B23.23</a>). A building with one or more printed stairwells has a ground level, first level, and a second level, and it is 2½ levels high. You must be higher than second level—on a third level hill, for example—to see past it.</p>
<p>Since we are at level 2, we can see past level 1/level 1½ obstacles to the ground level. The obstacle still blocks our LOS to the ground-level hex right behind it. Think of it as a one-hex shadow behind a one-level obstacle. A hex in the shadow of an obstacle is called a Blind Hex (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">A6.4</a>). Looking past X7, we cannot see W7 since it is directly behind X7. We can see V6, U6, T5 and both levels of S5. We can't see R4, because that is a Bund Hex due to the building in S5.</p>
<p>One thing about shadows; they get longer as the distance to the obstacle increases. Put another way, the farther away an obstacle is, the longer shadow it has, and the more Blind Hexes it creates. To be exact, an Obstacle has one more Blind Hex for every five hexes between the viewer and the obstacle (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.41" class="topiclink">A6.41</a>). How far away is S5 from us? &quot;Six hexes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How many multiples of five hexes is that? Between one and two, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, but in this case you discard fractions. It is one full multiple of five hexes, and it extends the shadow by how many hexes? &quot;One, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That gives it two Blind Hexes. Can you see the ground level of Q4? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What about the first level of Q4? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong. A one level obstacle, or a l½ level obstacle in this case, never blocks LOS between a second level hex and a first level hex.</p>
<p>Let's look out another window. Can you see DD10? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; CC10? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; BB9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why not? &quot;It's in the Blind Hex formed by the 1½ level building in AA9.&quot; Outstanding. Let's go back to our previous window and look toward U8. Can you see past it to S8? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. U8 is a l½-Level obstacle four hexes away and therefore creates only a one-hex shadow. Can you see Q8? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Q8 is &quot;behind&quot; building hex R7 but because our LOS does not cross that building obstacle—it casts no shadow for us. Can you see O8? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant, it's blocked by the building in P7 and P8.&quot; Correct. How about M8? &quot;I'm not sure, Drill Sergeant.&quot; You can't see M8 because the building in O8, which is ten hexes away, casts three Blind Hexes. M8 is blocked by the building in O8, even though you can't see the ground level of O8 because it is blocked by the building in P7/P8. Can you see K8? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How many Bund Hexes does it create behind it? &quot;Three, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why can't you see E8? &quot;It is blocked by the woods in I8, which is 16 hexes away, and creates four Blind Hexes.&quot; Back downstairs and into the truck. We're due at LOS Course 4FF5 in 20 minutes.</p>
<p><img src="brd4.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd4" style="border:none" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p>At ease. We are at the intersection of three roads. One leads off the board, another is lined with hedges and leads to a wooden building, and the third runs toward a stone building. You can see the wooden building in Y9 as well as all the road hexes leading to it. Can you see beyond Y9 to X9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The building blocks LOS. Similarly, you can't see beyond X1 to W1.</p>
<p><img src="foxhole.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="FOXHOLE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Hedges and walls have exactly the same effect on LOS, but they are different than woods and buildings because they are half-level obstacles (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.21" class="topiclink">A6.21</a>). Hedges and walls only block LOS between hexes on the same level as the hedge or wall, and then only if neither the target nor the firing hex is adjacent to the hedge or wall. For example, you can see past the hedge on the FF5-FF6 hexside all the way to FF10, and anyone in those hexes can see you too. You can also see along the EE6-FF6 hexside to EE7, DD8, and CC10. You can see to DD5 because the DD5-EE6 hedge forms a hexside of DD5. However, hedges block your LOS to CC5 and CC6, because they are neither part of your hex nor the hexes that you are trying to see. Can you see DD7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant, it's blocked by the EE6-EE7 hedge hexside.&quot; Correct. You should also keep in mind that units in Crest status or in an entrenchment cannot see past a wall/hedge hexside in their hex and at their elevation to a same level target (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>).</p>
<p>Now head down the road and cross the hedge to Z7. Look toward BB10. Can you see it? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No, you only think you see it. The hedge on the AA8-AA9 hexside blocks LOS. All walls and hedges are considered to extend to the very end of their hexsides (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.1" class="topiclink">B9.1</a>). The LOS touches the end of the hexside, because it runs through the vertex where hexes Z8, AA8 and AA9 meet. This is enough to block LOS.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can sight along a hexside such as Y7-Y8 to see X7 and beyond (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">B9.2</a>). You can even see DD7 from here, because the AA7-AA8 hexside is adjacent to your hex, and the CC7-CC8 hexside is adjacent to DD7. If you fired at DD7, the target would get a TEM of +1 because of the CC7-CC8 hedge. If it fired at you, you would get a TEM of +1 because of the AA7-AA8 hexside. The same is true if you fired at—or were fired at from—X7, due to the Y7-Y8 hexsides.</p>
<p>Can you see CCS? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; BBS? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; AA9? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Would a target in AA9 get the hedge TEM? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant&quot; Right, for the same reason that you are prevented from seeing BB10, the LOS clips the end of the hexside. Can you see BB9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; DD9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; EE7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Okay, you chowderheads are getting the hang of hedges.</p>
<p>Now, at the risk of confusing you, I'm going to touch upon how hedges differ from bocage. Bocage is a tall hedge grown atop an earthen mound and replaces hedges/walls when specified by SSR. Bocage is a level 1 obstacle—not a half-level obstacle—and has a TEM of +2—not +1 like a hedge. You cannot see down the length of a bocage hexspine as you can with a hedge and you must have Wall Advantage to fire through it to a non-adjacent hex. It costs two extra MF to cross a bocage hexside—not just the one extra MF of a hedge. Perhaps most importantly, a unit in a bocage hex which can't be seen by an unbroken enemy except through a bocage hex-side can grow a &quot;?&quot; counter at the end of its Player Turn. If you find yourself in a bocage scenario, I'd advise getting acquainted with <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.5" class="topiclink">B9.5</a> real quick.</p>
<p>Let's check out the grain field now. While it Hinders your fire, you can still see through grain hexes. You can see V7, T7 and R7. What is the DRM for firing at a unit in R7? &quot;+4, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, +1 for the woods and +3 for the three grain hexes. Even though that's a lot of Hindrance, you can still see R7. The maximum allowable Hindrance DRM for any one shot is +5; beyond that, the target is considered out of your LOS (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.10" class="topiclink">B.10</a>).</p>
<p>Now head to the biggest building on this board—P6. Board 4 is very flat. In fact, this building contains the only Locations above ground level on board 4. Before we go upstairs, let's look around from the ground level. What other buildings can you see from here? &quot;P8, CC6, S2 and P1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. You have to look through grain to see most of them. What blocks the buildings that you cannot see? &quot;Woods, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Can you see O9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant; the wall blocks the LOS.&quot; Can you see Q2? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Q1? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant, the Q2-Q3 hedge blocks the LOS.&quot; Can you see R1? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Can you see CC7? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; DD7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>Now climb the inherent stairs (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.22" class="topiclink">B23.22</a>) to the first level of P6. Hop onto that gray Level 1 counter. From up here, you still can't see past the woods which are Level 1 obstacles. How high do you have to be to see over woods? &quot;Level 2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Correct Woods and buildings still block your LOS, but you can easily see over grain, walls and hedges. Grain offers no Hindrance to your view from up here. For example, you can now fire at P1 or Y6 with no Hindrance DRM. You can see right over the grain. &quot;But Drill Sergeant, we're only a 7-4-7 and Y6 is nine hexes away. We can't even use Long Range Fire against it.&quot; Very good, Cantatore, but I was speaking generally—hoping that someday you might be entrusted with a MG. Besides, you can still see it—even if you can't hit it with your FP.</p>
<p>Can you see O9? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right—and there is no TEM or Hindrance for fire into O9 from here. What about O5? &quot;We can see it, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Of course you can, but it still gets the wall TEM of +2. Can you see Q2? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Q1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; R1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; And CC7 and DD7 too. You can see much more from up here, but you can be seen from many more places too. When you have an elevation advantage you are more dangerous to your enemy, but you are also a better target yourself. Whatever you can see, can see you too. Fall in on the hilltop on 2M5 in ten minutes. Squad, DISMISSED.</p>
<p><img src="brd2.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd2" style="border:none" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p>At ease. Here on 2M5 we are on a third-level hill hex. From here we can see all the other third-level hill hexes on board 2. An obstacle has to be higher than a particular level to block LOS between that level's hexes. Below us are woods in M4. Woods are a one-level obstacle, so woods on level 2 hexes are level 3 obstacles. From 2M5, you can't see past these woods to a lower level hex. Other level 3 hexes also block LOS to lower levels. From 2M5, you can't see O6 or any other hexes in that direction because of the plateau effect of N5—another third-level hex. Similarly, you can't see M3, M2, or M1 because of the third-level woods in M4. Of course, you can see both M4 and N5 with no problem.</p>
<p>You can see directly downhill to lower hexes. You can see all the level-two hexes from N4 to R2. You can see L4, K4, J3 and the woods in I3. You can also see ground-level hexes J2 and I2 among others. Hills have a much gentler slope than buildings and woodlines, and so don't create Blind Hexes unless they are five or more hexes away (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.23" class="topiclink">B10.23</a>). However, elevation advantage over an obstacle can reduce the number of Blind Hexes by one for each level of elevation advantage that is more than the one level needed to see over the obstacle in the first place (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.42" class="topiclink">A6.42</a>). In the case of non-Cliff Crest Line obstacles (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">B10.11</a>), Blind Hexes can be eliminated altogether by sufficient elevation advantage—but with other obstacles a minimum shadow of one Blind Hex is always left, regardless of the amount of elevation advantage.</p>
<p>For example, you can see K6 and K8, but the J8 and K9 Crest Lines are five hexes away and create one Blind Hex. However, we are on level 3 and the obstacles are only level 1 Crest Lines, so our extra elevation advantage negates the Blind Hex and we can see J9 after all. Now look at the level 2 hill hex F7. Since it is seven hexes away, it has a Blind Hex for every elevation drop behind it. It is only one level below us so we don't negate any Blind Hexes by elevation advantage. E8 is one hex behind F7 and one level lower which takes it out of our LOS. D8 is two hexes behind F7 and two hexes lower, so it too is in the shadow of F7; if we could see it, it would create just one Blind Hex since it is nine hexes away but we have a two-level elevation advantage over it. C9 is beyond the shadow of F7, and we could see it if there were no woods obstacle in D8. C9 is also ten hexes away, which extends its shadow to three hexes, but our elevation advantage reduces the shadow to two so we still can't see B9 or A10.</p>
<p>Woods on a level 1 hill become level 2 obstacles—even that portion of the woods depiction which may be growing on what appears to be a ground level portion of the hill hex (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">B10.1</a>). Being on level 3, we can still see over them, but they create a Blind Hex nonetheless. You can see M6 and M7, but the woods in M7 cast a shadow. You cannot see M8 because it is one hex behind the woods and one level below the elevation of the woods; and M9 is not visible because it is two hexes behind the woods and two levels below the elevation of the woods (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.43" class="topiclink">A6.43</a>). The ground level building in M9 still has its one hex shadow, so you can't see M10, either. Unlike shadows cast by hills, woods/buildings never lose their one-hex shadow regardless of your elevation advantage.</p>
<p>Can you see the woods in I3? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. We established that earlier. Can you see H2? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; G2? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; F1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. It is two levels below the woods in I3, but it is three hexes behind it. Can you see E1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Let's try a different direction. Can you see J6? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; I7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; H7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right— and even if there were no woods in I7, the woods in J6 would block LOS to H7 because H7 is at ground level and the woods in H7 are only a level 1 obstacle (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.43" class="topiclink">A6.43</a>). Can you see G8? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wake up! Yes you can! G8 is level 1, and is two hexes beyond I7—but only one level below the obstacle so I7 doesn't block it either. G8 is in plain view as you will doubtless find out the day someone shoots you from there. Can you see F8? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; E9? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. You remembered our extra elevation advantage over F8, which negates the</p>
<p>Crest Line's Blind Hex. D9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; C10? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding. The distance to E9 and our extra elevation advantage over E9 cancel each other out, so it has only a one-hex shadow.</p>
<p>Now look along the N4-R2 Hex Grain. You can see the second level hexes from N4 to R2. R2 ends in a cliff which has a LOS shadow as if it were a building. There is a two-level drop from the cliff to S2, and R2 is five hexes away, so the cliff has a three hex shadow. Can you see S2? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; T1? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; U1? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong. Two out of three isn't good enough in combat. U1 is level 1 which reduces the shadow to it by one hex. Looking at it another way U1 is one level below the obstacle, R2, and three hexes away. The distance of the obstacle from the viewer—five hexes—increases the shadow by one hex; in addition, there is a one-hex shadow due to the net elevation change of one level between R2 and U1. Thus the shadow of R2 is two hexes in length—but U1 is three hexes from the obstacle, which makes it visible to you. Of course, if a cliff is part of your hexside, it doesn't block your LOS to a lower Location; you can see right over the cliffs on the M5/L4 and the M5/L5 hexsides.</p>
<p>To practice LOS techniques, you are going to repeat the same exercise from a number of different vantage points. From a particular hex, look along the Hex Grain in all six directions and list the hexes that are in your LOS. To start with, go to J4 and look around. What do you see? I'll give you five minutes to write it down.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;In the six directions you should have seen: J3, J2, J1; K4, L3, P1, Q1, R0; K5; J5, J6, J8, J9; I5, H5, G6, F6, E7, D7, A9; I4, H3, G3, F2, D1. Anybody have any problems?</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't we see O2, Drill Sergeant?&quot; O2 is at level 0 and is two hexes behind the level 2 woods obstacle in M3. You are at level 3 so you don't have any extra elevation advantage to reduce the woods' shadow.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can we see A9, Drill Sergeant?&quot; C8 is seven hexes away from us—increasing its shadow by one, but it is also two levels below us—decreasing its shadow by one.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't we see E2, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Even though we have a two-level elevation advantage over the woods in F2, woods—like buildings and cliffs—always create at least one Blind Hex, which in this case is E2.</p>
<p>Now, what can you see along the Hex Grains from Q6?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;From Q6 you can see: Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1; R5, S5, U4, W3, X2, Y2, Z1; R6, S7, V8, Z10; Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10; P6, O7, N7, M8, L8; P5, O5. Any questions?</p>
<p>&quot;Why can we see Q3? Doesn't the woods block LOS?&quot; The woods are a level 2 obstacle, but Q3 is at level 2 also. The woods must be higher than Q3 to block LOS. Blind Hexes can only exist if we are at least as high as an obstacle that is itself higher than the hex we are looking at.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can we see Q1, Drill Sergeant?&quot; The only obstacle in question is the hill Crest Line in Q2 which has no shadow since it is within four hexes of us. Crest Lines, unlike other obstacles, can have their shadow reduced to 0 by elevation advantage.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can we see W3, Drill Sergeant?&quot; W3 is only one level below U4, but two hexes away. &quot;How about Y2, Drill Sergeant? X2 is five or more hexes away. Doesn't it create a Blind Hex?&quot; The Crest Line in X2 has one Blind Hex because of distance away from us, but we have a two-level elevation advantage over it which reduces its shadow back to 0. Similarly, our extra elevation advantage cancels X9's being a Blind Hex due to distance, so we are able to see Z10.</p>
<p>Now try the view from U4. It is only a level 2 hex, but see what you can see along the Hex Grains.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You should have seen: U3, U2, U1; V3, W3, X2, Y2, Z1; V4, W5, Y6, Z6, CCS; U5, U7, U8, U9; T4, S5, R5, Q6; T3, S3, R2. Any questions?</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn't the wall block LOS to U9, Drill Sergeant?&quot; No, a wall blocks LOS traced on the same level only. If you are above the wall it has no effect on LOS. Now try Y6 and check out the LOS along all Hex Grains.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;From here you can see: Y5, Y4; Z5, AA5; Z6, CCS; Y7; X6, W7, U8, T8, P10; X5, W5, U4, R2. Any questions?</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't we see Q10, Drill Sergeant?&quot; The woods in S9 creates two Blind Hexes because it is six hexes away and we only have a one-level elevation advantage. Push on to F7 and repeat the exercise.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You should see: F6, F5, F4, F3; G7, H6, J5, K5; G8, H8, L10; F8, F9, F10; E8, D8, A10; E7, D6, C6, B5, A5. No questions? Outstanding. Let's try a couple from ground level. Go to O10 and repeat the exercise.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;You are able to see: O9, O8, O5; P9, Q9, R8; P10; N10; N9, M9. When looking uphill, you can see only the first hex of each level above you; O9, O8 and O5 in this case. One more time, go to C6 and repeat the exercise.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;From here you are able to see: C5, C4; D5, E5, G4, H3; D6, E7, F7; C7; B6; B5, A5. The D5-E5 wall blocks LOS to F4, but not to hill hexes G4 and H3. E7 and F7 would not be in LOS if you are of the opinion that your LOS crosses the building obstacle in D6. I'm not, but these things have been known to vary slightly from one board to another. For our final LOS session, fall in at the stone building in 24Z9 after chow. Squad, DISMISSED.</p>
<p><img src="brd24.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd24" style="border:none" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p>At ease. Around you we have mostly familiar terrain. Can you see BB9? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; DD10? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; DD9? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That's better. The end of the wall blocks LOS. In training you get a second chance; in actual combat you might not.</p>
<p>Looking in the other direction you see an orchard in X9. It Hinders LOS in the same manner as grain except that it Hinders any LOS traced through the orchard hex—even a LOS traced along the orchard's hex-side. The LOS does not have to be drawn through the orchard symbol depiction to be affected; the entire hex is considered composed of orchard, including the hexsides. You can see through the orchard to W10, V9, V10, U10, and T9 with a Hindrance of +1. You can see past the grain field to another orchard that is in BB6. What is the total Hindrance of fire into BB6? &quot;+2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Into BBS or CC6? &quot;+3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The orchard adds its Hindrance to the Hindrance from the grain. How about CCS? &quot;+4, Drill Sergeant.&quot; DD3? &quot;+5, Drill Sergeant.&quot; DD2 or EE3? &quot;+6, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No, you don't have LOS to those hexes. You can't have a Hindrance DRM of more than +5 (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.10" class="topiclink">B.10</a>). You can't see beyond CC3-DD3-EE4 because the combined Hindrance finally builds up so that it blocks LOS.</p>
<p>Now move to the wooden building in Y9. The brush acts exactly like grain. It only Hinders LOS drawn through the brush depiction itself. You can see right through the brush to V7 and W7, but with a Hindrance of +2 in each case. You can also see U8, but with a Hindrance of +3, +2 for brush and +1 for the orchard.</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, the LOS cuts through three hexes that contain brush: X8, W8, and W9. Shouldn't there be a Hindrance of +3 for brush?&quot; The Brass has changed the wording of <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">A6.7</a>. Hexes W8 and W9 are both two hexes away so only the Hindrance in one of those two hexes apply. Now let's move out to Q4 to study more effects of orchards on LOS.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Look at the orchard in O3. Even though you can see past the tree trunks to other hexes on ground level, the leafy crowns of the trees in June block LOS to and from higher hexes as if the orchard were a woods hex (<a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.2" class="topiclink">B14.2</a>). In fact, an orchard is a lot like a woods hex without the undergrowth. Thus, you cannot see past the orchard in O3 to N2.</p>
<p>On the other side of the hedge you see a lumberyard in Q5. For LOS purposes the lumberyard is exactly like a single story building. Can you see the lumberyard in Q6? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Can you see R5? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; PS? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good.</p>
<p>Let's go to M8. The path through the woods in L8 allows us to move easily through the woods, but it doesn't do anything for vision. Can you see L8? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Can you see K9? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What types of terrain do not affect LOS, Collier? &quot;Paths, roads, shell-holes, Open Ground and Water Obstacles, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good anticipation; the pond doesn't block LOS at all. You can see directly from L8 to M10, and from M9 to L9, right over the water. Now assume that an enemy unit is in O10 using Bypass along the O10-O9 hexside. Is there a Hindrance DRM to your fire at vertex O10-N9-O9? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant; +2&quot; Wrong! A unit is always at the higher elevation when Bypassing an obstacle that is at the higher elevation of a Crest Line in its hex (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.34" class="topiclink">A4.34</a>). Therefore, your attack has no Hindrance DRM.</p>
<p>Gullies don't block LOS but they're hard to see INTO because they're so narrow. To see INTO a gully, your distance in hexes from the gully must be no greater than your elevation above the bottom of the gully (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.3" class="topiclink">A6.3</a>). I'll show you what I mean. Go to H7. You are now two hexes away from the nearest gully. The bottom of the gully is at level -2, but here in the valley our own elevation is -1, so our elevation above the gully bottom is only one. How far from a gully must we be to see INTO that gully? &quot;One hex, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Move to H6. Now you can see INTO the gully in hexes G6, H5 and I6. What's more, you can see along the gully if you can see INTO it, as long as your LOS doesn't leave the gully symbol itself (inclusive of the dark green background; <a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.2" class="topiclink">B19.2</a>). You can see not only H5, but H4 and H3 as well, but not H2. You can't see J5 either, because the woods in I6 block your LOS. Units in Crest status (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.9" class="topiclink">B20.9</a>) are considered a Level above the gully and therefore can be seen as if they were at normal Open Ground level. One more question: is there a Hindrance DRM for firing into H3? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant—because we're at a higher level than a unit IN the gully.&quot; Right. The Brass have declared that if the firer and target are at different elevations, an intervening gully-brush hex presents no Hindrance. If the unit in H3 were in Crest status, then the H4 brush would Hinder our fire at it.</p>
<p>Now enter the gully in H5. What can we see? The six adjacent hexes, as well as H3 and F6. LOS to H3 has a Hindrance of +1 due to the brush in H4, and in F6 you can see both the bridge and the gully below it. &quot;But Drill Sergeant, my LOS to H3 doesn't actually cross any brush depiction—it lies entirely within the gully symbol. Why should the brush Hinder my LOS?&quot; Observant cuss, aren't you Ellberger? The brass has declared that whenever brush or woods are depicted on both sides of a gully depiction in a gully hex they are considered part of that gully depiction.</p>
<p>Move along the gully to H3. This is one of the rare places where you cannot see INTO an adjacent hex. H2 is out of your LOS because it is also in a gully and that gully isn't directly connected to our gully hex through a shared Depression hexside. From here you can see F2, G2,I2 and J2 because they are two levels above us and only two hexes away. What other hexes can you see from here? &quot;G3, G4, H4, H5, H6, I3 and I4, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right—but remember that if we were in Crest status here, we'd be at level -1 and our LOS ability would change considerably.</p>
<p>Move back along the gully to F6. You cannot see anything on top of the bridge; the bridge blocks LOS between units on and below it (<a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">B6.2</a>). What hexes can you see? &quot;The six adjacent ones, H5, I5 and D7, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Very good. Now move to E7. The cliff along one side of the gully allows you to see adjacent hexes on top of the cliff, but nothing beyond it—regardless of height (<a href="chb_chb11.htm#11.21" class="topiclink">B11.21</a>). You can see E6, D6 and D7, but not C6. If the cliff weren't there, you would be able to see C6 since it is two levels higher and only two hexes away.</p>
<p>Now move back up the gully to D9. Even though we can see hexes D6 through D3, our LOS passes through the crags in D7. A crag Hinders LOS that passes through any portion of its hex, in the same manner as orchards (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.6" class="topiclink">B.6</a>). However, crags are not an obstacle or Hindrance to LOS from a higher Level. LOS traced to D6 has a Hindrance of +1, for example, but the LOS traced to D2 has no Hindrance at all. Let's go to K3 for another look at crags.</p>
<p>From K3 you can see I4 with a Hindrance of +1. Can you see H4? &quot;Only the Crest status Level, Drill Sergeant, since it is a gully.&quot; Can you see the woods in G5? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; With what Hindrance? &quot;+2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. What about J4? &quot;We can see it with a Hindrance of +1 due to the crag, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding. You can see G3 with a Hindrance of +1. A cliff hexside never blocks LOS sighted along it (<a href="chb_chb11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">B11.2</a>), so we can see past the J2/J3 hexside, but the crag hexside is sufficient to Hinder LOS into G3.</p>
<p>You're ready for the last LOS exercises. Start in the gully in C10. As before, list what you can see in each of the Hex Grain directions.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You should have seen the five adjacent hexes plus E9 and A9. A fellow with a magnifying glass and a picky demeanor might make a case that the LOS to D9 crosses light green prior to reaching the D9 hex center dot and therefore E9 is not in LOS. A good lawyer might win this case after a few appeals, but this sort of situation comes under the heading of House Rules (or even a LOS die roll; <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">A6.1</a>). In my games, I expect LOS to be more clearly blocked and assume that it isn't otherwise. Players should come to an understanding over just how picky they'll be before these problems develop. Now try from the woods in G5.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;You were able to see: G4, G3, G2; H4, I4, J3, K3, L2; H5, I6; G6, G7, G8, O9, G10; F5, E6, D6, C7, B7, A8; F4. Try it again from K7, and remember it is June.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;You should have seen: K6; L6, M6; L7, M8, N8, O9; K8; J7, 18, H8, G9, F9; J6.</p>
<p>&quot;Why couldn't we see P9, Drill Sergeant?&quot; An orchard in season is a one-level obstacle to LOS from a higher level. You can see through the orchard to O9 which is on the same Level as K7 and the orchard, but P9 is a level higher, so the orchard blocks LOS between K7 and P9. Now see what you can view from the woods in F2 above the valley.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You should have seen: F1, F0; G2, I1, J0; G3, H3, I4, J4, P7; F3, F4, F9, F10; E3, C4, B4, A5; E2, D1, C1, and B0. I hope you remembered that you could see over the woods in the valley to the ground Level terrain on the other side of the valley.</p>
<p>Let's review LOS from a building. See what you can see from the first level of S7. Remember that the first level of a building in a valley at level -1 is at level 0.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;You should have seen: S6, S5 (both levels); T6 (first level); T7, U8, V8, W9; S8, S10; R7, Q8, P8, M10; R6, Q6, M4 (first Level). Any questions?</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't we see S2, Drill Sergeant?&quot; S5 is a 1½-Level building, which gives it a net height of level ½. You are at level 0 so S5 blocks your LOS to anything below level 1. S2 is at level 0 so it is blocked by S5. For the same reason you can't see past M4 to J2. One last exercise: what can you see along the Hex Grains from the second level of V3, the highest point on board 24?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> From V3 you saw: V2, V1, V0; W3, X2, Y2, Z1, BB0; W4, Y5, Z5, AA6, EE8, FF8, GG9; V4; S5 (first Level), O7, N7, L8, I10, H10; U3, T2, S2, R1, Q1, P0.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't we see DD7, Drill Sergeant?&quot; The orchard in season, when seen from above, is a one-level obstacle, like a woods hex. It normally has a one-hex shadow, but since it is six hexes away it obscures two hexes. DD7 is two hexes behind it and therefore you can't see it. &quot;Is that why we can't see V10, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Exactly. &quot;Drill Sergeant, why can't we see U4? After all, it is in the adjacent hex?&quot; Actually, you can see the rooftop, but the second level is obscured by the roof. You can't see through a roof without X-ray vision and although there may be several Clark Kents among you, I don't see any Superman! &quot;Why can't we see the bottom level of S5 since we can see the first Level?&quot; U4 has a two-level drop to the ground in T4, so it has two Blind Hexes at ground level. The ground level of S5 is one of them, but the first level is only one level below the obstacle and there is only one Blind Hex at that Level, so you can see the first level of S5. &quot;Why can't we see the first level of R5?&quot; Building S5 blocks LOS to everything in R5 but the rooftop, and you can't see through the roof to the first level inside the building. Any more questions? Good. I hope none of you leave with the impression that you can only see along Hex Grains. Tomorrow you will put your LOS knowledge to work at the Rifle Ranges where you will qualify with your weapons. Report to 4C7 at 0600 with your IFT in hand. Squad DISMISSED.</p>
