<p>At ease. Previously we just took walks through the countryside, but combat is more than a Sunday School picnic. Today we start to get serious. We will learn how to use our weapons. The Firing Range runs from 4C7 to the woods in M2.</p>
<p>To fire at a target, load your rifle, remove the safety, hold the stock firmly against your shoulder, and aim at your target. Position the target squarely within your sights, take a deep breath, let it out halfway, and squeeze the dice before you roll them. Roll one white die and one colored die, and add the resulting numbers on the two dice together to obtain a Dice Roll (DR). The lower the DR, the more damage you are likely to inflict on your target.</p>
<p>Before you fire, carefully select your target. You can fire at any Location that you can see, within your weapon's range. Infantry Small Arms fire into a Location affects all enemy occupants of that Location except those to which a LOF is blocked such as being entrenched behind a wall (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>) or non-Crest units IN a Depression (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.92" class="topiclink">B20.92</a>) (unless it is Defensive First Fire, which affects only moving units), but affects friendly units only if in Melee (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.4" class="topiclink">A7.4</a>). However, you can fire at only one Location each time that you fire, unless you have a MG or an underlined range factor which qualifies you for Spraying Fire (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.34" class="topiclink">A7.34</a>, <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.5" class="topiclink">A9.5</a>).</p>
<p>Next, determine the amount of firepower (FP) that you are using against your target. This depends on your inherent FP, the range to the target, and several other factors. Now you will learn what those numbers on your uniform mean. The first number is your FP. The second number is your Normal Range, hi your case, your FP is seven and your Normal Range is four hexes. If you fire at a target in an adjacent hex, your FP is doubled due to Point Blank Fire. How much FP would you have against a target in D6? &quot;14, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. You use your normal FP beyond Point Blank range and up to your Normal Range. At which hexes in our Firing Range do you have seven FP? &quot;E6, F5 and G5, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>You can fire beyond your Normal Range up to double your range. Which is the farthest hex at which you can fire? &quot;K3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How far away is K3? &quot;Eight hexes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Beyond your Normal Range, your FP is halved. How much FP would you have if you fired at K3? &quot;3½, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How much FP would you have against L2? &quot;I don't know, Drill Sergeant.&quot; You have no FP against L2 since that is more than double your Normal Range, you ninny!</p>
<p>Once you have determined your total FP, use that number to locate the proper column to use on the Infantry Fire Table (IFT). You have all been issued an IFT in your ASL rulebook; you should have it with you now and at any time you are in danger of engaging in combat. Look along the &quot;DR/FP&quot; row until you find the highest bold number not higher than your available FP. This is the column of the IFT you use for your attack. In your case, you would use the 12 column for Point Blank Fire, the 6 column at Normal Range, and the 2 column at Long Range.</p>
<p>&quot;But our FP factors are all higher than that, Drill Sergeant.&quot; You still use the next-lower column if you haven't got at least as much FP as that listed at the top of the column (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.3" class="topiclink">A7.3</a>), blockhead. For example, you use the 8 column for 11 FP even though 11 is closer to 12 than it is to 8.</p>
<p>Next roll two dice and sum the numbers to get a total DR between 2 and 12. Cross-index this DR with the correct FP column on the IFT to determine the result. If the result is &quot;—&quot;, you wasted good ammunition. Your target is unaffected aside from maybe wondering what you were shooting at. A &quot;PTC&quot; is a bit better (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.305" class="topiclink">A7.305</a>); each unit in the target Location must take a Pin Task Check (PTC). Now they at least know what you were firing at. Your opponent makes a DR for each affected unit. If the DR exceeds the morale of the unit, it is pinned. The men in the pinned unit are sufficiently discouraged to keep their heads down. This halves their FP and disadvantages them in other ways.</p>
<p>&quot;What is a unit's morale, Drill Sergeant?&quot;</p>
<p>Morale is the third number on your uniform. Your morale is 7. European/American squads usually have Good Order Morale of 6, 7, or 8. A leader's morale is his first number. My morale is 8. Leaders have morale ranging from 6 to 10.</p>
<p>As I was saying, if a unit rolls higher than its morale during a PTC, it is pinned. If it rolls its morale or less, it is unaffected by your fire. For example, if you took a PTC, you would be pinned if you rolled 8 to 12. and okay if you rolled 2 to 7.1 would be pinned if I rolled 9 to 12, and OK if I rolled 2 through 8. Major Eastwood, who is a 10-3 leader, would be pinned only if he rolled an 11 or 12.</p>
<p>The next-better result is a Normal Morale Check (NMC) (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.303" class="topiclink">A7.303</a>). This is similar to a PTC. Each unit in the target Location must take a Morale Check (MC). However, there is more at risk. If the unit rolls higher than its morale, it breaks and is flipped over to its broken side. When a unit is broken, it cannot fire or move normally; all it can do is rout away or wait until it rallies. If the unit rolls exactly equal to its morale, it is pinned (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.8" class="topiclink">A7.8</a>) just as if it failed a PTC, but it is not broken. Thus, the unit is unaffected only if it rolls less than its morale. If it rolls a 12, it has taken a Casualty MC (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">A10.31</a>) and suffers Casualty Reduction. Casualty Reduction wounds a SMC (perhaps mortally), eliminates a crew or Half Squad (HS), and Reduces a squad to a HS.</p>
<p>1MC, 2MC, 3MC, and 4MC are variations on the NMC result. A MC must be taken for each affected unit in the target Location, but the specified number is added to the DR. For example, if you score a 2MC on a target Location, each affected unit in that Location must add two to its Morale Check DR. However, a Casualty MC occurs only if the Original DR—before all modification—is 12.</p>
<p>More devastating than a MC is a K result (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.302" class="topiclink">A7.302</a>). There are four possible K results: K/1, K/2, K/3, and K/4. At least one of the target units, chosen randomly, suffers Casualty Reduction (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.302" class="topiclink">A7.302</a>); all the remaining target units take a MC, adding the number following the &quot;K/&quot; to the DR. So, if you get a K/1 on the target, at least one unit is Reduced, and all target units—including any HS created by Casualty Reduction—must take a 1MC.</p>
<p>Worse yet is a KIA which stands for Killed In Action (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.301" class="topiclink">A7.301</a>). Each KIA is preceded by a number, which is the number of units in the target Location that are removed from the mapboard via cardboard body bags. The exact units are chosen randomly if there are more target units than the KIA number. All other target units are broken; no MC is necessary. Scoring a KIA result is like hitting the jackpot on a slot machine.</p>
<p><img src="prepfire.gif" width="61" height="59" alt="PREPFIRE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />You are now going to use the Firing Range. You will be firing strictly on your own with no leadership benefit from me. All fire will be considered Prep Fire, and when you resolve it you will be marked with an orange-on-white Prep Fire counter (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.12" class="topiclink">A.12</a>). The Prep Fire counter signifies that you have already fired and will not be allowed to fire or move until it is removed at the end of the Advancing Fire Phase. A simulated German First Line squad, a 4-6-7, is your target. There it is now in K3 where you can fire at it at Long Range since it is eight hexes away. How many FP factors do you have? &quot;3½, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Roll the dice and use the 2 column of the IFT. And for God's sake, keep that weapon pointed down range. The first trainee to hit my counter with an accidental DR will need a boot extractor before he can sit down.</p>
<p>Your first DR is a 7. You missed, try again. DR 6: a PTC. What is a PTC? &quot;Pin Task Check, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How does that effect the target squad? &quot;If it rolls 8 through 12, it is pinned. If it rolls 7 or less, it is okay.&quot; Your next attack DR is a 4. What happens?</p>
<p>&quot;The squad must take a 1MC, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What does it need to pass the 1MC? &quot;It needs a 6 or less, Drill Sergeant.&quot; And what happens if it rolls a 6? &quot;It is pinned, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What if it rolls a 12 for its MC? &quot;It is Reduced to a HS and broken, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The HS it is Reduced to is determined by the squad's Class, which is in the upper right corner of its counter. For instance, the 4-6-7 squad would Reduce to a 2-4-7, a First Line HS, which is broken.</p>
<p>Bulls-eye! You've rolled a 2 for a K/1 result. What happens to the target squad? &quot;It is Reduced to a 2-4-7 HS, Drill Sergeant.&quot; And then what? &quot;The HS must take a MC, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Does it add anything to this MC? &quot;Yes.&quot; Yes, what? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No, blockhead, what does it add to its MC DR? &quot;I don't know, Drill Sergeant.&quot; It adds the number following the &quot;K/&quot;, which is 1 in this case. Remember it. Your opponent may not be so co-operative. That 2 DR would have been subject to Cowering in combat, but here on the Firing Range we'll forget that for the time being.</p>
<p>We have another simulated target: a 4-4-7 Second Line German squad in E6, two hexes away. What is the column that you use on the IFT? &quot;The 6 column, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why the 6 column? &quot;The target is at Normal Range and we have seven FP at Normal Range, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>Your first shot is a 9 which is a miss. You are shooting high. . . adjust your dice. Your next shot is an 8. What is the effect on the target squad? &quot;It must take a PTC, Drill Sergeant. If it rolls greater than its morale, it is pinned.&quot; What DR does it need to pass its PTC? &quot;7 or less, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding.</p>
<p>It passed its PTC. Your next DR is a 4. What happens? &quot;The target must take a 2MC, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What if the target rolls an Original 6? &quot;It adds the 2 of the 2MC to get an 8, which is greater than its morale, and it breaks, Drill Sergeant.&quot; A DR of 3. What happens to your target? &quot;It suffers a K/2 result. It is Reduced to a HS which must take a 2MC.&quot; Which HS is the 4-4-7 Reduced to? &quot;A 2-3-7, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What DR does the HS need to stay unbroken? &quot;Five or less, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What happens if the HS rolls a 5? It is pinned, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What if it rolls a 12? &quot;It is Reduced, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Reduced to what? &quot;Nothing; it is eliminated.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay. . . we have a simulated 4-6-7 squad target in D6. All of you should be able to hit it at this range. What column do you use when firing at D6? &quot;12, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What DR results in a miss? &quot;11 &amp; 12, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Your first DR is a 10. What happens? &quot;The squad takes a PTC, Drill Sergeant. It must roll its morale or less to avoid being pinned.&quot;</p>
<p>Now I want you to fire at the simulated Conscript 4-3-6 squad target at every range from eight to one hex. Keep firing until you eliminate it. And then fire at it again at the next closer range, until you eliminate it again. Remember that if it breaks it then uses its broken side morale, which is 5 for this unit. A broken squad that breaks again is Reduced to a HS. A broken HS that breaks buys the farm. What HS does this squad get Reduced to? &quot;A 2-3-6, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Lock and load one magazine. Keep your weapons pointed down range. Commence Fire.</p>
<p>g You should have noticed that targets usually last a long time at Long Range, but tend to melt away rapidly under Point Blank Fire. However, nothing is guaranteed. Some of you may have dispatched the Long Range target faster than the Point Blank one. You have been firing only at targets in the open so far, but in actual combat your opponent will seldom be so gracious. Most terrain offers some protection in the form of modifiers added to the IFT DR. For example, if the target is in woods, you must add +1 to the DR of your attack. This is called a TEM. It offers troops in the woods more protection than they would get in Open Ground. For example, if your target is in E5, a woods hex, and you attack it with your normal FP of 6, you would miss on an Original DR of 8 or more. A PTC result would occur on an Original DR of 7, and so on. What Original DR would be required to obtain a NMC? &quot;Six, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, because 6 plus 1 for the woods TEM is 7, and a 7 DR on the 6 column of the IFT yields a NMC. What would result in a 1MC? &quot;4 or 5, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. What would you get with an Original 2 DR? &quot;K/2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Then how could you get a KIA? &quot;Attack with more FP, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Exactly.</p>
<p>It's time to learn more about how terrain protects targets from fire attacks. Load onto that truck—we're going to another range at 24N6.</p>
<p><img src="brd24.gif" width="174" height="81" alt="brd24" style="border:none" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Fall In. Around us you see woods in O6, a wooden building in N7, and a stone building in M6. The woods affords some protection since it has a +1 TEM. A wooden building is better because it has a +2 TEM. A stone building is the best with a +3 TEM. As an exercise, we have a simulated German First Line 4-6-7 squad target in each of those three hexes. Fire at each of them, one at a time, taking turns, until you eliminate all three. Remember that you have 14 FP with Point Blank Fire, the target squad has a morale of 7 when broken, and it Reduces to a 2-4-7 HS with a broken Morale Level of 6. Fire when ready.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You should have noticed that the squad in the stone building is a lot tougher to break than the one in the woods. You may have also noticed that being in good terrain doesn't guarantee anything; it only makes it tougher for the attacker to hit you—not impossible. You may have actually broken the target in the stone building before the one in the woods.</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, we have been firing at the targets from the open. If we were in the same building, would the target still get the same TEM?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, even if both you and the target were in the same Location of the same building or firing up or down stairs. The TEM for buildings and woods are the same regardless of the terrain that the firing unit occupies except for Factories (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.741" class="topiclink">B23.741</a>) which you won't encounter anytime soon.</p>
<p>Let's move to Q7. You see a lumberyard in Q6. This is treated exactly the same as a single story wooden building for TEM and LOS purposes. There is also a hill in hexes P7 and Q8. It is not really a hill, we are actually in a valley, but everything is relative so it is just like a hill as far as we are concerned. Having a Height Advantage (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">B10.31</a>) gives you some protection— a TEM of +1 to be exact—but it applies only if you receive no other beneficial TEM and is never applicable to units in Crest status. For example, a target in Q8 gets a TEM of +1 for being uphill from you, but a target in P7 gets only a TEM of +1, even though it is both in woods and uphill from us. It can choose one method of protection or the other, but not both.</p>
<p>Hedges and walls also provide protection. Let's move to Q4. There is a wall between you and the wooden building in Q3, and hedges between us and the buildings (or lumberyard) in P4, Q5 and R4. A hedge has a TEM of +1 if you are firing across it, and a wall has a TEM of +2. However, a target can only use either the hexside TEM or the TEM of its hex—not both (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.31" class="topiclink">B9.31</a>). If you fire at a target in Q3, it can use either its wall TEM or its building TEM, which are both +2. If you fire at a target in R4, it has a choice of a hedge TEM of +1 or a stone building TEM of +3. You're all thinking that it's obvious which TEM the target would choose, but it's not always that obvious.</p>
<p><img src="walladvan.gif" width="57" height="58" alt="WALLADVAN" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Sometimes it is wise for a defender to choose a lower hexside TEM to retain his Wall Advantage (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.32" class="topiclink">B9.32</a>). When units from opposing sides are in adjacent hexes separated by a hedge or wall, they cannot both use the same wall or hedge for protection; they would be practically on top of each other. Wall Advantage also applies to hedges and Bocage as well as walls. A Wall Advantage counter is used to mark the unit(s) with Wall Advantage, and can be claimed in five (5) different cases: 1) during setup; 2) at the *end* of any RPh (ATTACKER first); 3) during a friendly MPh/APh either before or after expending an MF/MP; 4) when HIP status is lost; or 5) whenever all enemy units lose/forfeit WA over shared wall/hedge hexsides. Also, a unit unable to claim in-hex TEM of at least +1 *must* claim WA (so no WA counter is necessary in this case). Suppose there is an enemy squad in Q3; if they claim WA at the end of the RPh before we move, then we would get no TEM for the wall when we move into Q4. They would then shoot us with a -1 FFMO DRM and no TEM instead of us getting a +2 wall TEM, that's a 3 point swing on the DR! If they didn't claim WA in the RPh, then we could claim it when we move into Q4—and now we get the +2 Wall TEM. If the enemy were in hex L4 instead, then they would automatically have WA without having to claim it or put down a WA counter.</p>
<p>You can also lose the Wall Advantage by using the TEM of something else in your hex (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.31" class="topiclink">B9.31</a>). For example, suppose that an enemy unit in R4 held Wall Advantage over us, which denies us the use of the +1 TEM for the hedge. If we fired at it and it chose to use the +3 TEM of the building instead of the +1 TEM of the hedge to resolve that attack, it would immediately lose the Wall Advantage to us.</p>
<p>Similarly, suppose that a German unit in Q3 had the Wall Advantage over us when some other GIs fired at them from P3. If the German chose to use the TEM of the building, they would lose the Wall Advantage to us. If they wanted to retain the Wall Advantage, they would be considered in Open Ground with a 0 TEM while resolving that attack. Claiming or forfeiting Wall Advantage never has any effect on LOS except Bocage. For example, the German in Q3 could still be fired on from Q2 even though they were claiming Wall Advantage against fire from Q4. What TEM are they using? &quot;They're dropping WA and claiming the building TEM. I guess they are worried about those guys in P3.&quot; Then we get Wall Advantage, and our friends in P3 are not committed to the attack. They can move on to better things.</p>
<p>You can also qualify for a hexside TEM if the fire passes through the length of a hexside (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">B9.3</a>). For example, if we were to fire at a target in R2, it would get a TEM of +2 for the wall between Q3 and R3. Wall Advantage does not apply to this situation; it only applies if two enemy units are adjacent on both sides of a wall or hedge. So in this case each unit would receive the beneficial TEM when fired upon by the other.</p>
<p>There is a lot of terrain that gives no protection to units therein but does Hinder fire that passes through. . . I can see that a lot of you chowder-heads haven't got the slightest idea of what I'm talking about. I'll show you what I mean. Move to the wooden building in Y9.</p>
<p>g Looking around us you see a lot of different terrain types. Y10 is a road hex. Does it give you any cover? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. It is just like Open Ground. You can also fire right through a road hex with no problem, just like Open Ground. Z9 contains a stone building. What protection does it give you? &quot;A stone building has a TEM of +3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Buildings stop bullets very effectively, so that an enemy unit on the other side of a building—in AA10 for example—cannot be affected by your fire at all. Similarly, woods stop all fire through them, even though they only give units in them a TEM of +1 . Can you fire at a unit in Y7? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why not? &quot;The woods block fire, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>There is grain in Z8, brush in X8, and orchard in X9. They all have a TEM of 0, giving no protection to targets therein against your fire, but they all Hinder fire through these hexes at targets beyond them. The Hindrance in each case is a +1 DRM added to your IFT DR for each Hindrance hex that your fire passes through on its way to the target (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">A6.7</a>). You don't count any Hindrance in your own hex or in the target's hex— just the hexes in between except for SMOKE.</p>
<p>So far we have come across two types of DRM. What are they? &quot;TEM and Hindrance modifiers, Drill Sergeant.&quot; From your position in Y9, what is the DRM of a target in Z8? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; In AA8? &quot; +1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; BB7? &quot; +2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; CC7? &quot; +3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong. It is only +2, one for the Hindrance in Z8 and another for the Hindrance in AA8. BB7 is Open Ground and has no Hindrance at all. In fact, every hex along the road from BB7 to GG5 only has a total DRM of +2.</p>
<p>What is the DRM of a target in X9? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. What about W10? &quot; +1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; V10? &quot; +1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No, you forgot the TEM of the woods. A target in V10 has a TEM of +1 for the woods and a Hindrance of +1 due to the orchard in X9 for a total DRM of +2. I'll give you another chance. X8? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; W8? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; V7? &quot;+3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Why +3? &quot;+1 for the woods and +2 for Hindrance due to the brush in X8 and W8, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The path has no effect on fire. Like a road, it affects movement but not fire. Now move to M9.</p>
<p>g You can see across the water to L9. The pond has no effect on fire. What is the total DRM if you fire into L9? &quot; +1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. How about N8? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; O8? &quot; +1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; P7? &quot;+3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Nope. Hindrances only apply if you are firing through them, not over them. When you fire at a higher level, such as up to P7, you fire over the grain fields in N8 and O8. The DRM equals only the TEM of the woods, or the TEM for Height Advantage. What is the DRM of a target in O10? &quot; +2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Only the TEM of the wooden building applies. Suppose the target in O10 fired at us? What DRM would we have? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Only woods TEM applies.</p>
<p>Let's move on to L8. We've been here before. You can see along the pond hexside to M10. What is the DRM for a target in M10? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What about a target in L4? &quot;+2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; How do you figure that? &quot;+1 for the Hindrance of the orchard in L7 and +1 for the hedge.&quot; Outstanding. Now let's go to G7.</p>
<p><img src="crest.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="CREST" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Look at the bridge adjacent to us in F6. Firing at a target with your LOS traced along the road, the bridge is treated as Open Ground. What DRM would we have if we fired at a target on the bridge? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Past the bridge in E6 or D5? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; In C5? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant, for Height Advantage.&quot; Gullies also have no effect on firing except that it's hard to see a unit in a gully. You can fire right into the gully in G6 because we are ADJACENT to it. The target is as vulnerable as if it were in Open Ground. What DRM would it have? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Let's assume our next target is in Crest status. Crest status bestows a +2 TEM (the same as entrenchments) to any Direct Fire from a position that does not have a LOS INTO the Depression, or one that is traced through one of the protective Crest hexsides. What if the target were in Crest status on the G6-G7 hexside? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant, because we are ADJACENT and therefore have a LOS INTO the Depression.&quot; Good. What if we were in G8 instead? &quot;+2, Drill Sergeant, because we no longer have a LOS INTO G6.&quot; What if the Crest target was centered on hexside G6-G5? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant, because our LOS does not cross a Crest hexside.&quot; Outstanding. That's enough on Crest status. How about a target on the other side of the gully in the woods in G5? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. Only the woods affects your fire—not the gully. You can also fire into the gully, below the bridge in F6, with a DRM of zero (<a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">B6.2</a>).</p>
<p>Now move to the woods in F7. From here, fire against a target on the bridge would be partially blocked by the sides of the bridge depiction. The target would have a TEM of +1, which it wouldn't have for fire along the road from G7 or E6. Also, the bridge can Hinder fire that is not traced along the road, as if the bridge were grain or brush. What is the DRM of a target in F6? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; F5? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; F4? &quot;+3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. Why? &quot;TEM of +1 for the woods, Hindrance of +1 for the bridge, and a Hindrance of +1 for the brush.&quot; Outstanding.</p>
<p>Let's move onto the bridge, which we have to do via G7. Remember? A unit below us in the gully is safe from our fire since we can't see it and vice versa. We can fire INTO the gully in G6 or E7 with a 0 DRM. If targets IN the gully fired back at us, we would get a DRM of +1, from either Height Advantage (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">B10.31</a>) or the bridge. Exit the bridge via E6 and go through the brush and into the woods in G5.</p>
<p>From here we can see down INTO the gully in H4, H5 and G6. What DRM would targets IN any of those hexes have? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. What about a target in I4? &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No. Even though a unit in H4 is IN the gully, the brush in the hex is both IN the gully and at its Crest status level (<a href="chb_chb19.htm#19.21" class="topiclink">B19.21</a>). Since we are in a valley, the brush exists both at level -1 and -2 in H4. It thus Hinders our fire through H4 and the target in 14 would have a DRM of +1 due to the Hindrance caused by the brush.</p>
<p>From our position, J3 has both a TEM of +1 for fire into the crag hex and a Hindrance of +1 for fire traced through the brush hex. If we fire at a target in J3, what DRM would it have? &quot;+2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right— +1 for the brush Hindrance and +1 for the Crag TEM . How about K3? &quot;+2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; L2? &quot;+3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding.</p>
<p>Suppose you fire at a target in J2. What DRM would it have? &quot;+3, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The gully doesn't affect your fire, and the brush Hindrance doesn't apply since the target is above us on level 0. The cliff hexside doesn't affect fire except that the uphill unit gets Height Advantage. What would be the DRM if you fired at a unit in 12? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant, for Height Advantage.&quot; Good. What if that unit fired back at you? &quot;We'd have a DRM of +1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. The cliff doesn't affect Small Arms fire at all from the top of the cliff.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> FALL IN! Let's review some of the lessons from this morning. What are the two types of DRM encountered thus far? &quot;TEM and Hindrance, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What causes TEM? &quot;Terrain in the target hex, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What causes Hindrance? &quot;Terrain between the firer and the target, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What are the three ranges at which you can fire? &quot;Long Range, Normal Range, and Point Blank Fire, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What are their respective effects on your FP? &quot;Halved, normal, and doubled, Drill Sergeant.&quot; There is yet another range category which we have not yet discussed. It is called Triple Point Blank Fire (TPBF) (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.21" class="topiclink">A7.21</a>) and results in tripled FP against targets in the same Location as the firer. It is rather rare—who can tell me why? &quot;Drill Sergeant, I thought you weren't allowed to enter a Location containing an enemy unit in the MPh, and if you don't enter such a Location until the Advance Phase (APh) you would be in Melee before you could actually fire on the IFT.&quot; You've seen combat in the old game, haven't you? Well, you're right for the most part. However, there are occasions where certain units can enter an enemy-occupied Location in the MPh, and when it occurs the DEFENDER has no choice; he must use triple FP against the entering units (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.312" class="topiclink">A8.312</a>). If the DEFENDING unit has already used its First Fire capability, it must use Subsequent First Fire which would still be tripled (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">A8.3</a>) against the moving enemy in its hex, but would then also be halved for using Subsequent First Fire. Briefly, Subsequent First Fire allows a DEFENDING unit that has already fired and is marked by a First Fire counter, to fire again at a moving target with half its FP—provided it selects a target which is within its Normal Range and no farther away than the closest Known enemy unit. If the defending unit has already used Subsequent First Fire, it must instead use Final Protective Fire (FPF) against the moving unit. FPF is the equivalent of Subsequent First Fire except that it can only be used against ADJACENT or same-hex moving units, and its resolution DR also serves as a NMC against the firer after resolving fire against the target. A unit using FPF is being pressed to the breaking point—and may do more damage to itself than to the enemy. &quot;Drill Sergeant, can the ATTACKER ever use TPBF?&quot; Yes, sort of. If he is not broken by the DEFENDER'S TPBF First Fire/Subsequent First Fire/FPF, he can return fire with TPBF but it is always halved for taking place in the Advancing Fire Phase (AFPh)—but that's another lesson.</p>
<p>Shellholes are no Hindrance to fire, but they do have a TEM of +1 for units in the shellholes. If units are moving quickly through a shellhole hex paying only one MF and not entering the shellholes, they are treated as being in Open Ground. What is the DRM of a target in X2? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; XI? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Y3? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Z2? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Y2? &quot;+1, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What?! &quot;Zero, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That's better—now give me fifty!</p>
<p>There are a number of other factors that affect fire in addition to range and terrain. One is pinning. How does a unit become pinned? &quot;By failing a PTC, Drill Sergeant, or by passing a MC by rolling exactly equal to the unit's morale.&quot; Outstanding. Being pinned is not a disaster, but it can lead to one. Among other things, it halves your FP. This is in addition to halving for other factors such as Long Range.</p>
<p><img src="pin.gif" width="64" height="62" alt="PIN" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Suppose that you are under fire and become pinned. You are marked with a Pin counter. What would your basic FP be? &quot;3½ Drill Sergeant.&quot; What FP would you have at Long Range? &quot;1 ¼, Drill Sergeant.&quot; With Point Blank Fire? &quot;7, Drill Sergeant.&quot; &quot;What good are the fractions, Drill Sergeant? Why don't we just drop fractions?&quot; Suppose that you're combining FP with a pinned 3-3-7 HS at Long Range. The HS would have three FP, halved to 1½ for being pinned, and halved again to ¾ for Long Range Fire. That, added to the 1¾ of the squad, equals 2½ FP and allows you to use the 2 column of the IFT. If you dropped fractions, you would only be able to use the 1 FP column.</p>
<p>What other effect that we've learned about can reduce FP? &quot;Well, if you Double Time us up that hill again I'll scarcely be able to hold my rifle— let alone aim it, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. CX (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.51" class="topiclink">A4.51</a>) adds a +1 DRM to the attack of all units it affects for as long as they tote the CX marker around. It doesn't reduce your FP, but it certainly reduces its effect. Pinning, concealment, Cowering, Hindrance, CX, and the TEM that we have encountered so far all reduce the effectiveness of FP. We'll talk about concealment (<a href="cha_cha12.htm" class="topiclink">A12</a>) and cowering (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.9" class="topiclink">A7.9</a>) later.</p>
<p>Leadership is an important factor that increases the effectiveness of your FP. You have seen how a leader can speed up a squad's movement. A leader can also make a unit's attack more effective as I'll now explain. The first number on a leader's counter is his morale. The second number is his leadership, which can be used as a DRM for attacks. Not all leaders benefit an attack. Normally, leadership DRM range from +1 to -3 . A zero-DRM leader does not modify an attack but is still useful in directing attacks to avoid cowering. A leadership DRM of -1, -2, or -3 improves an attack that the leader directs. A leader with a leadership DRM of +1 can actually lessen an attack's effectiveness, but can still prevent cowering.</p>
<p>To affect an attack, the leader must be in the same Location (i.e., generally speaking, the same hex and the same level within that hex) as the unit it is going to direct. A leader can direct the fire of all units in its Location, but only if they all fire together at the same target. Using the leader to direct an attack is optional (even a 6+1 leader; <a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.72" class="topiclink">A10.72</a>), just as the act of firing is optional. Make no mistake about it however, a leader directing an attack is assumed to be firing for all rules purposes. If the leader directs the attack, his leadership is added as a DRM to the attack DR, and he is restricted in his other activities as if he had fired.</p>
<p>I am an 8-1 leader. If I direct your fire by pointing out targets in the hex and politely encouraging you to use your weapons, your fire is more effective and you subtract one from your attack DR. This can neutralize the effect of woods or hedges, reduce the protection of a building, and make Open Ground even more dangerous. However, I can't do this if I am pinned or broken (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.831" class="topiclink">A7.831</a>, <a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.7" class="topiclink">A10.7</a>).</p>
<p><img src="concealjap.gif" width="59" height="59" alt="CONCEALJAP" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Connerski! How much FP do you have against that target in X1? &quot;What target, Drill Sergeant? All I see is woods.&quot; That's right, but any terrain capable of concealing an enemy (i.e., Concealment Terrain; <a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">A12.12</a>) can be a target if it is in your LOS. Suppose that woods hex contains hidden enemy units (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.3" class="topiclink">A12.3</a>)—are you going to wait for them to shoot you to see if they are there? If you have reason to suspect the presence of enemy units in a Location, you can fire at it with halved FP in an attempt to reveal them. If your halved FP attack results in a PTC result or better on the IFT, any hidden/concealed units therein are revealed. &quot;But how do we know when and where to suspect a concealed enemy?&quot; Usually, they do you a favor by wearing a &quot;?&quot; counter, which means they may or may not be there (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.11" class="topiclink">A12.11</a>). But hidden units could be in any Concealment Terrain if so allowed by Scenario Special Rule (SSR) or during a night action (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.2" class="topiclink">E1.2</a>). That's a thing that no Squad Leader knows for certain, but the best ones develop a sixth sense about. Now... how many FP factors can you exert on X1? &quot;3½ with a +1 TEM which is negated by your leadership, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>
<p>Another consideration for determining FP is Cowering (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.9" class="topiclink">A7.9</a>). As hard as it is to believe that any of you stalwart lads would freeze under fire, the fact remains that statistics tell us that it happens to a majority of troops under fire. Cowering occurs whenever the Original—that is, face-value— IFT DR results in Doubles, unless the attack is directed by a leader. There are a number of other exceptions which you'll learn later but for the time being just remember that whenever you Cower your FP column on the IFT is reduced to the next column on the left—unless you're Inexperienced in which case you lose two columns on the IFT. So, if you Cower, what will your FP be reduced to in an otherwise normal attack? &quot;4, Drill Sergeant.&quot; More importantly, the Brass has decreed that any unit that cowers, as well as all of its SW, is automatically marked with a Prep Fire or Final Fire counter as applicable. This means that cowering also results in loss of Multiple Rate of Fire and Subsequent First Fire.</p>
<p>Up until now, everything you've learned about DRM and FP has been applicable to all fire conducted on the IFT, regardless of phase. However, there are three fire phases in each Player Turn and each of them has rules applicable only to that phase. Those phases are the Prep Fire Phase (PFPh), Defensive Fire Phase (DFPh) including both First Fire (which actually occurs during the opponent's MPh) and Final Fire, and the AFPh. One of the basic rules to remember is that all fire occurring in the AFPh is halved—even if the firer has done nothing else in that Game Turn (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.24" class="topiclink">A7.24</a>). The only exception to this is if the ATTACKER declares Opportunity Fire (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.25" class="topiclink">A7.25</a>) in the PFPh, which allows him to fire in the AFPh at full strength but not at all in the PFPh nor may he move in the MPh.</p>
<p>However, units with an underlined FP factor—such as you—are equipped with automatic or semi-automatic weapons which allow you to use Assault Fire (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.36" class="topiclink">A7.36</a>) within Normal Range. A unit using Assault Fire in the AFPh may, after all other modifications, add one to its FP and round fractions up. So your FP in the AFPh is 5 (7 [FP] divided by 2 [AFPh] = 3½ + 1 [Assault Fire] = 4½ (FRU [Assault Fire]) = 5.)</p>
<p><img src="firstfire.gif" width="58" height="58" alt="FIRSTFIRE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><img src="finalfire.gif" width="59" height="58" alt="FINALFIRE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Two of the most important DRM (FFNAM &amp; FFMO) deal with the target's movement status and therefore apply only during First Fire (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.6" class="topiclink">A4.6</a>). A unit that fires during First Fire (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.1" class="topiclink">A8.1</a>) is marked with a purple-on-white First Fire counter until the DFPh is over. Should that unit fire again during First Fire by using Subsequent First Fire, the First Fire counter is flipped over to its Final Fire side. First Fire affects only moving units (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.1" class="topiclink">A8.1</a>); therefore those DRM—as well as the First Fire attacks themselves—do not apply to non-moving units in the same target Location at the moment of attack. The other portion of the DFPh occurs after the opponent's MPh has ended and is referred to as Final Fire. The advantage of waiting to use Final Fire is that the attack can affect all the enemy occupants of the target Location—not just moving units. A unit that has already used First Fire, as signified by the First Fire counter on top of it, cannot use Final Fire except against adjacent or same-hex targets, and even then has its FP halved (prior to Point Blank Fire doubling/tripling). A unit that is already marked with a Final Fire counter cannot fire at all in Final Fire, but can fire during the MPh as FPF (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.31" class="topiclink">A8.31</a>), which is also dangerous to the firer. And remember, FPF can be made mandatory by an enemy able to enter the DEFENDER'S Location during the MPh. A unit that fires in any capacity during Final Fire is marked with a Final Fire counter which remains until the end of the DFPh.</p>
<p>First Fire Non-Assault Movement (FFNAM) is a -1 DRM applicable to each moving unit during its MPh unless it has declared the use of Assault Movement for that move. Assault Movement is a declared one-Location move that requires less than a unit's full, non-CX, MF allotment. Any other form of movement assumes some form of prolonged erect posture which makes a better target.</p>
<p>First Fire Movement in the Open (FFMO) is a -1 DRM applicable during its MPh to each moving unit that enters an Open Ground hex and cannot claim some form of protective TEM or LOS Hindrance DRM. So, as you can see, multi-hex movement into an Open Ground hex could be subject to a combined -2 FFNAM/FFMO DRM which is sure to ruin your day. Perhaps now you better understand the dangers of Bypass.</p>
<p>This probably leaves you with the impression that any attack with a FFNAM/FFMO DRM is the best possible. Usually true, but not always. Let's move to M7 and assume you are now a 3-3-7 HS with no leadership. Assume that an enemy unit has just moved from N4 to O5 without using Assault Movement. Because we have a clear LOS from M7 to the entire hex-side crossed by that moving unit we can declare a Snap Shot (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.15" class="topiclink">A8.15</a>). Snap shots are conducted with half FP, and no FFMO/FFNAM DRM apply to them, but neither does the TEM of the hex moved into. A regular attack on O5, using the -1 EFNAM DRM on the 2 FP column with a DR of 5, would result in No Effect due to the +3 TEM of the building. However, the same DR on a Snap Shot attack using the 1 FP column results in a PTC because there are no applicable DRM. There are a few exceptions to the rule about terrain in the target hex not applying to a Snap Shot. SMOKE in the target hex is applicable to a Snap Shot, as is the TEM of a wall or hedge of the target hex crossed by the fire on the way to the target hexside. For example, a unit in O6 entering P5 would be subject to a Snap Shot from M7 with a +2 DRM for the wall. However, just crossing a wall/hedge hexside does not add that TEM to the Snap Shot. For example, a unit entering P6 from P7 would not be subject to a TEM for a Snap Shot from M7. There is also the matter of whether you should withhold your First Fire altogether, ignoring the temptation of those negative DRM, so as to be able to fire with full FP in Final Fire against all the enemy occupants of a target Location rather than against just moving units which seldom move together in groups. But the answer to that question always depends on the situation, and requires far more intuitive skill gained from combat experience than we can hope to instill here.</p>

<p>At ease. This course is very simple because you will do all the firing—nobody will be shooting at you—unless one of you points his weapon at me. We will proceed down this road one hex at a time. I will call out our present position, fire phase, your Original DR, and the Location of a simulated target which has just popped up. You will respond by instantly caning out your total FP against that target, any applicable DRM, and the result of that fire. I will be directing your fire unless stated otherwise. There will be a total of 21 targets. You can make Expert with a score of 19 or more, Sharpshooter with 17 or 18, and Marksman with 15 or 16. If you miss more than six targets, you have failed to qualify and will be dropped back to the next cycle for retraining. Keep your IF'1 at the ready. (Those of you at home should cover the answerline—overprinted in gray—with a bookmark until you're ready to answer.) Any questions? Good, let's begin.</p>

</div>
<p>Nervous, aren't you? You'd better be... because you butchered that shot. Your FP is 14 due to PBF, but I'm pinned so I don't direct your attack which, with an Original DR of 2, means that you Cowered (Doubles) leaving you with only 8 FP (down one column from 12). Your total DRM is only +1 for the Woods TEM— you can't claim Height Advantage in addition to another beneficial DRM. The result is a K/2—better than you had assumed. Try again—and this time I won't be pinned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>X2, First Fire, DR: 12. Target is moving into X2 without using Assault Movement.</p>

<p>Good! You recognized TPBF plus the application of both FFMO and FFNAM plus my leadership DRM. What else can you tell me about what just happened? &quot;Well, we better hope the target failed that 1MC, because we sure failed our NMC caused by the FPF and have now either broken or suffered Casualty Reduction due to that Casualty MC—depending on whether a Random Selection dr picks you/us as the Casualty Reduction.&quot; Wrong! Had it been a FPF situation, your FP would have been halved after tripling, resulting in only 10½ FP. We were not marked with a Final Fire counter so our attack was not subject to FPF penalties. Had it been, your analysis would have been correct except that with only 10½ FP, the result to the enemy would have only been a PTC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>W2, AFPh, DR: 7. Target: U1.</p>

</div>
<p>Correct on all counts. FP is halved due to AFPh Fire but increased to five by Assault Fire, and a +1 Height Advantage DRM applies which is nullified by my leadership DRM.</p>

<p>Outstanding. You didn't fall for the bait. FFMO does not apply because this is Final Fire—not First Fire. Only my leadership DRM applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>T3, AFPh DR: 9. Target is concealed in S3.</p>

</div>
<p>Good. Your FP is halved twice by AFPh Fire and Concealment, but is then doubled for PBF before adding one FP and rounding fractions up for Assault Fire. The +2 DRM for the wooden building more than counteracts my -1 leadership DRM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S4, PFPh, DR: 5. Target: Q3.</p>

<p>Right again. The DEFENDER cannot have both the wall and building TEM and my leadership DRM negates only part of the +2 TEM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R3, First Fire, DR: 3. Target is Dashing into P2 from P4.</p>
<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px;"><table class="grey overprint" style="background-color:#c0c0c0; border:none; border-spacing:0px;">

</div>
<p>Wrong. Your FP is halved against a Dashing unit, but the Wall hexspine Q4-Q3 still adds a +2 DRM to your fire (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.32" class="topiclink">B9.32</a>) and cancels any FFMO DRM because the target is no longer considered in Open Ground (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.61" class="topiclink">A4.61</a>). The +2 TEM of the wall negates my -1 leadership DRM and the -1 FFNAM DRM, for a total DRM of 0 resulting in a 1MC on the 2 FP column. Alternatively, you could have made a Snap Shot at the P3-P4 hexside, which would have resulted in a 1 FP attack—due to being halved once for the Snap Shot and again for the Dash—and a -1 DRM for my leadership. This too would have resulted in a 1MC.</p>

<p>Good. AFPh Fire and Assault Fire yield five FP, and the +3 TEM of the stone building is partially negated by my leadership. &quot;Drill Sergeant, since this is the AFPh and Pin markers are removed at the end of the Player Turn before the DEFENDER can fire again anyway, is there any reason for him to actually take a PTC or can it be ignored?&quot; Sometimes it can be ignored, but not if there is a possibility of that PTC causing a Sniper or Booby Trap attack, nor if there is a chance that the ATTACKER will wish to advance into the hex for CC during that Player Turn.</p>

<p>Good. You added the +1 orchard Hindrance DRM to the +1 woods TEM and deducted my leadership. What special significance does the result of your attack have regardless of the outcome of the PTC? &quot;The target loses its concealment, Drill Sergeant.&quot;</p>

<p>Outstanding. You could have said: &quot;14 FP, +1, 3MC&quot; but you correctly chose a superior form of attack—the Snap Shot. You'll make Expert with that kind of shooting.</p>

<p>Good. You remembered that terrain Hindrance does not apply to a different level target. Later you will learn about SMOKE Hindrance (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.4" class="topiclink">A24.4</a>), which is a different matter altogether.</p>

<p>Good. A Bypassing target in an otherwise Open Ground hex always offers a -2 DRM for FFMO/FFNAM. Although firing at a vertex that includes O5, you correctly concluded that you weren't eligible for PBF because the target was actually in P5. Had the</p>
<p>target been Bypassing at M5-M6-L5 instead, the +1 TEM of the hedge would have been applicable because you would have been firing down that hexspine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wrong! You have no attack. You can't see the target because your LOS to the only vertices transited is blocked by the M6 building, while a LOS to the M5 hex center doesn't cross a hexside Bypassed by the unit. You should've waited for the unit to continue its move before firing. Now you've wasted your opportunity. If it's any consolation, you did have the DRM correct for fire against a unit Bypassing a hedge hexside through another hedge hexside (-1 for FFNAM, +1 for the hedge, -1 for my leadership).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M7, AFPh, DR: 7. We are CX and the target is K8.</p>

<p>Good. The CX +1 DRM cancels out my leadership of -1, leaving only the +1 for the orchard Hindrance and the +1 woods TEM. From here on, I won't be directing your fire.</p>

<p>Good. A +2 DRM applies for Hindrance of the brush in J6 and I7—even though J6 is technically a woods hex—because the LOS crosses the brush depiction and not the woods depiction. Similarly, there is no Hindrance DRM for the bridge because the LOS does not cross the bridge depiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Correct. Although you lost the Hindrance DRM for the brush in J6, you gained one for the bridge because your LOS now does cross the bridge depiction. Your FP is halved twice—once for the AFPh and again for Long Range Fire—and Assault Fire is not applicable at Long Range.</p>

<p>Outstanding. Long Range Fire no longer applies nor does the bridge Hindrance DRM because your LOS is now traced solely through the road depiction.</p>

<p>Perfect. You recognized that the +2 TEM of Crest status must apply, because only hexsides E6-F7 and E6-F8 can accommodate Crest status due to the cliffs and Depression hexsides of the other four. You also realized that the -1 DRM for FFNAM must apply because the MMC had to expend four MF to enter Crest status from E7 (two MF to enter the E8 gully, and two more to achieve Crest status), making Assault Movement impossible. It is interesting to note that, were the cliffs not present, your target could have moved into Crest status along hexside E8-D7, you could have applied the FFMO -1 DRM as well because the entrenched TEM would not have been applicable—thereby making E8 an Open Ground hex. The Final DRM in that case would have been -2 (FFMO &amp; FFNAM) rather than +1.</p>

<p>Wrong. The +1 DRM for Height Advantage applies, but your FP is reduced to the next column to the left due to Cowering. Remember, I am not directing your fire any more. The correct answer is: 4FP, +1, 2MC.</p>
<p>Those of you who have qualified with your weapons will learn how to close with and destroy the enemy in Close Combat tomorrow. Report to 3AA7 at 0600. Those of you who missed seven or more targets and failed to qualify, return to the LOS Course for remedial training.</p>
