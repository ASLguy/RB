<p>At ease. In combat you have to know how to take it as well as dish it out. You have learned to fire at targets; now you will learn how to be the target. This includes taking MC, routing broken units, and rallying them to fight again.</p>
<p>You learned about MC earlier. Let's review what you know. How do you get a MC? &quot;As a result of enemy fire, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Is it good to get a MC? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Can you get a MC as a result of fire from friendly units? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant, if they happen to fire into a Melee we are in.&quot; What adds to a MC DR? &quot;The severity of the MC, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Very good. What are the possible results of a MC? &quot;You can pass it and be okay, you can fail it and become broken, or you can pass it but become pinned, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What if you roll an Original 12 during a MC? &quot;You are Reduced by a Casualty MC, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding.</p>
<p>If there are numerous units taking a MC in a Location, they must each take it one at a time with their own DR. If there are leaders in the Location, they check their morale first, in order from the highest-morale leader to the lowest. For example, with just you maggots and myself here, I would take my MC first. If I passed the MC, I would help you clowns with yours. In a NMC, I break if I roll 9 or more. If I roll 7 or less, I add a -1 to your MC DR so that you break on an Original DR of 9 or more, become pinned on an 8, and are still okay on an Original DR of 7 or less. I cannot use my leadership to help my own MC—only yours. If I roll an 8 on my own MC, I am pinned and my leadership is instantly nullified even though I am not broken. Consequently, I cannot assist you in your MC (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.831" class="topiclink">A7.831</a>).</p>
<p>Now let's invite a couple of other leaders, an 8-0 and a 7-0, to join us for a MC. I take my MC first, but I cannot help the 8-0 leader since we have the same morale. A leader cannot help another leader who has the same or better morale (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.22" class="topiclink">A10.22</a>). I can help the 7-0 with his MC, but not the 8-0. The leadership of only one leader may be used. If there were a 9-2 leader in the hex with us, he could apply his leadership to all of us and you would use his -2 leadership instead of my -1. I can apply my leadership to another leader only if he has lower morale, but to any friendly MMC, even if it has the same or higher morale.</p>
<p>If you are in the same Location as a leader, and the leader breaks, it shakes you up. I can just imagine how disturbed you would be if your beloved Sgt. Stahler lost his nerve. After taking any MC caused by the same attack that broke me, you must take a Leader Loss Task Check (LLTC), which is just like a PTC. If you roll more than your Morale Level with two dice, you are pinned. You are unaffected if your DR is equal to or less than your morale. However, there is a catch: you reverse the smitten leader's leadership and add it to the DR. Therefore, if I break, you have to take a PTC and add +1 to the DR. You skip this check if the broken leader has the same or lesser morale than you, or if you are already broken or pinned— even if it could result in a Sniper (<a href="cha_cha14.htm#14.1" class="topiclink">A14.1</a>) or Booby Trap attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.9" class="topiclink">B28.9</a>).</p>
<p>If the leader is eliminated instead of just broken, you must take a MC— not merely a PTC. Again, you only take this MC if the leader has higher morale than you. For example, if an 8-1 leader or an 8-0 leader is eliminated, you must take a MC; a 1MC in my case, just a NMC in the case of the 8-0 leader. If the 7-0 leader is eliminated, you do not take a MC, because your morale is the same or higher than his. If you're already broken at the time of my elimination, you don't have to take a MC. Who can tell me why? &quot;Because we hate your guts, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No, wise mouth, because your broken Morale Level is an 8, which is equal to my own. Now, give me a hundred!</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, what if a leader in our Location is pinned?&quot; That doesn't force you to take any check, it just negates his leadership—even for the same attack that pinned him and will next affect you. &quot;Drill Sergeant, does terrain affect MC or PTC?&quot; No, other than modifying the IFT DR that caused the MC or PTC in the first place. I take that back. TEM are applied as negative DRM to the NMC DR caused by White Phosphorous (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.31" class="topiclink">A24.31</a>), but the Germans rarely have any of that stuff so they are the ones who have to worry about being on the receiving end.</p>
<p>However, there is more to breaking than just being flipped over to your broken side. That's bad enough, but there are more serious consequences to failing a MC. You've already learned about Casualty MC on an Original DR of 12 (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">A10.31</a>), and the Reduction of broken units that fail a MC (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">A10.31</a>). However, there's another possible consequence of breaking for unbroken, non-crew units called Replacement (<a href="cha_cha19.htm#19.13" class="topiclink">A19.13</a>). Whenever an unbroken Personnel unit fails a MC by an amount greater than its Experience Level Rating (ELR; <a href="cha_cha19.htm#19.1" class="topiclink">A19.1</a>), that unit is Replaced by a broken unit of the same size but lesser quality. ELR is a number from 0 to 5 which is inherently assigned to all units of a given side in a scenario. The Replacement unit must be of a poorer Class and can contain no FP, Range, Morale, or leadership factor(s) greater than those of the unit it is Replacing. Therefore, if an unbroken German Elite 4-6-8 squad with an ELR of 4 fails a MC by five or more, it is Replaced with a broken First Line 4-6-7. If my ELR is 5, and I fail a MC by 6 or more, I would be Replaced with a broken 8-0 leader counter. Squads with an underlined Morale Factor (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.23" class="topiclink">A1.23</a>) - such as yourselves—are considered to always have an ELR of 5, and if subject to Replacement, are Replaced with two broken HS of the same Class. So, if you have to take a 2MC and roll an 11 or more (after any applicable leadership modification), you'd be Replaced by two broken Elite 3-3-7 HS—not by a broken 5-4-6 squad. If an unbroken HS with an underlined Morale becomes subject to Replacement, it becomes broken and Disrupted instead. Any questions?</p>
<p><img src="disrupt.gif" width="60" height="59" alt="DISRUPT" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />&quot;Drill Sergeant, why aren't broken units affected by Replacement?&quot; Broken units that fail a MC are already subject to Casualty Reduction—any further penalty beyond that permanent effect would be too harsh. &quot;Drill Sergeant, what is Disrupted?&quot; Disruption is a special form of broken status which usually occurs to a unit that has failed a MC by more than its ELR but is unable to suffer Replacement—usually because it is already the poorest quality Class of unit of its size and type. It can also occur to a HS with an underlined Morale Level which fails a MC by more than its (ELR) (<a href="cha_cha19.htm#19.12" class="topiclink">A19.12</a>), and due to a variety of lesser special cases we won't discuss here. The main effects of being Disrupted are that the unit cannot Self-Rally while so affected, and its ability to rout is limited to any RtPh in which it is in a Blaze Location, or Water Obstacle, or in Open Ground within the LOS and Normal Range of an enemy unit or ADJACENT to an enemy vehicle—although if ADJACENT to or in the same Location with an enemy Infantry/Cavalry unit the Disrupted unit must surrender to it rather than rout away. A Disrupted unit cannot use Low Crawl, does not prevent enemy movement into or through its Location and remains Disrupted until rallied or captured.</p>
<p>Now you know how to become broken. Frankly, I never thought this group would have any problem learning that—you're natural &quot;broken&quot; material if I ever saw any. Nevertheless, being broken is a bummer. Leaders lose their leadership. Broken units are more easily destroyed, since they are Reduced if they fail another MC. They cannot move normally, and cannot advance, fire, or attack in CC. There are just four things that broken units can do: rout, rally, surrender, or die.</p>
<p>Routing occurs after all fire in a turn, but before units advance. In general, broken units must get away from the enemy and seek shelter. Routing is similar to moving since units expend MF while routing. A broken unit must carry any SW it possesses up to its IPC—all others are abandoned (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">A10.4</a>). Only broken units can rout although an unbroken unpinned leader in the same Location with a broken unit may voluntarily rout with that unit (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.711" class="topiclink">A10.711</a>). Most unbroken units can break voluntarily and rout (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.41" class="topiclink">A10.41</a>). &quot;Drill Sergeant, why would a unit want to break?&quot; There are circumstances that call for it. Suppose you're in a burning building and about to be burnt to a crisp, or pinned, alone, and ADJACENT to all the enemy squads in the known world. It might make sense to voluntarily break and rout out of Dodge, rather than wait for the inevitable.</p>
<p>The idea of routing is generally to get back to woods or buildings where the chance of rallying is increased (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.61" class="topiclink">A10.61</a>) - preferably out of enemy LOS and fire. Broken units are generally forced to rout if ADJACENT to a Known, unbroken, armed enemy unit unless they are held in Melee (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.16" class="topiclink">A11.16</a>). Broken units in Melee cannot rout in the RtPh, although they are forced to withdraw from Melee during the CCPh. A broken unit in Open Ground in the LOS and Normal Range of a Known, unbroken, armed enemy unit is also generally forced to rout. Being in Open Ground (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.531" class="topiclink">A10.531</a>) includes being on a hill, on a road, on a bridge, or in a gully—provided there is no Hindrance to the enemy's LOS, nor any TEM (including Height Advantage; <a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.531" class="topiclink">A10.531</a>). The enemy unit in question cannot be pinned, CX, broken, or in Melee, and it must have some FP, which excludes non-heroic leaders without SW. You cannot rout toward a Known enemy broken unit or a non-heroic leader without a SW but they don't cause you to have to rout in the first place. Or putting it another way, a broken unit (or a non-heroic leader without a functioning weapon) has no Normal Range, and therefore cannot by itself force a broken enemy unit to rout, nor can it Interdict that broken unit, even if that broken unit is ADJACENT to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, what is a Known unit?&quot; A unit is Known if it isn't hidden/concealed and is in your LOS.</p>
<p>Now, assume we're broken in 3U3 and DM (which I'll explain in a minute), and there's a German 4-6-7 squad in the neighborhood. From which hexes could it force us to rout away? What about V3? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. It is ADJACENT to us and we are caught in the open—although if it was concealed/hidden and wished to remain that way it would not affect us. How about T3? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Even if we had the Wall Advantage, we would still have to rout because the enemy is ADJACENT to us. U4? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; S3? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. We would have the TEM from the wall protecting us, which makes U3 Non-Open Ground from S3. R1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; U1? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, since the grain Hinders LOS and we get a TEM from the hedge. X1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; W4? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right—we're not even in the LOS of the enemy. BB1? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong. BB1 is seven hexes away and the Normal Range of a 4-6-7 squad is only six hexes—although if it had a MG we'd need our routing shoes.</p>
<p>You may be able to rout at your option, even if not required to, but only if you're under the effects of Desperation Morale (DM). If you're DM, but not ADJACENT to an enemy nor in the open within Normal Range and LOS of a Known enemy unit, you can either stay where you are or rout toward safer cover. There are a number of reasons for remaining in place, the most common being that there is no safe route by which to rout out of your current position. More often than not, you'll want to rout to a position out of enemy LOS where you can hope to avoid DM status in future Player Turns.</p>
<p>Units become DM when they first break, whether due to enemy fire or voluntarily breaking. They also become DM when they are already broken and are subsequently fired at (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.62" class="topiclink">A10.62</a>), or when a Known enemy unit becomes ADJACENT to them, or if they start a RtPh in Open Ground in the LOS and Normal Range of a Known enemy unit according to the Brass. DM makes it much harder to rally, but allows a unit to rout. It is removed during the Rally Phase (RPh) unless ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit. DM status can otherwise be voluntarily kept beyond the RPh only if not presently occupying a building/woods/pillbox/trench Location, so that the unit can continue to rout to one in the next RtPh.</p>
<p>All routing units have six MF which cannot be increased by any condition. In addition to paying normal movement costs for entering terrain, routing is governed by a number of additional rules that only apply to routing units.</p>
<p>1. Routing units may not enter a hex ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit unless they are in the process of leaving that Known enemy unit's Location (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">A10.51</a>). They may not end their rout ADJACENT to a Known unbroken, armed enemy unit. For example, if there were an unbroken, unconcealed enemy 4-6-7 in U4, we could not rout to T3 or V3. On the other hand, if there were 4-6-7 squads in V3 and S4, we could rout to T3 since the unit in S4 was not Known to us. However, once we got there, we couldn't stop because the enemy unit would now be Known. We would have to keep routing, and S3 and T4 are out of the question because they are both ADJACENT to the enemy unit in S4. Any other hex would be subject to Interdiction, thereby making it subject to surrender to the enemy unit in S4 (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.21" class="topiclink">A20.21</a>). However, if that enemy unit rejects that surrender and eliminates us instead, No Quarter (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.3" class="topiclink">A20.3</a>) would be invoked and <a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.21" class="topiclink">A20.21</a> would not apply for the rest of the scenario. For the sake of simplicity, we'll consider No Quarter to be in effect for the rest of our training.</p>
<p>2. Routing units may not rout toward a Known armed <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> enemy unit. This means they may not rout to a hex that decreases their range to such an enemy. For example, if a Known enemy unit were in Z1, five hexes away, we could not rout to V3 which is only four hexes from the enemy even though it is out of LOS of Z1. That same unit, even if broken/Disrupted <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> , would also prevent us from routing to V2. However, were it the only enemy unit in LOS, it could not force us to rout because it has no Normal Range while broken or unarmed.</p>
<p>3. Routing units must rout to the nearest building/woods hex—even if using Low Crawl—unless there is no such hex you could legally rout to within six MF (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">A10.51</a>). &quot;Nearest&quot; is determined by the number of MF it takes to get there. Aside from the extra MF cost to exit an entrenchment that the unit is already in, the extra voluntary cost of entering entrenchments/shellholes (to avoid Interdiction) or leaving wire is not counted in determining whether a building/woods hex is within six MF or is the closest such cover (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.531" class="topiclink">A10.531</a>). However, if there were an enemy unit in U2, we'd have to rout to V3 at a cost of two MF, rather than T3 which costs three MF because of the wall. In determining the nearest building or woods hex, you may disregard hexes that are the same distance from a Known enemy unit as your currently occupied hex—even if there are no other building/woods hexes within six MF. For example, if there is an enemy unit in X1, you may rout to V3 since that is also three hexes from the enemy, but you may alternatively rout to T1, S3, T3, or T4—all of which are three MF away and farther away from the enemy than V3. You may also disregard other hexes/Locations of the building that you began the RtPh in.</p>
<p>4. Upon reaching a building/woods hex, a routing unit must stop unless either ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit, or able to continue directly into other woods/building hexes only. Assuming the enemy unit in X1, you could rout to T3 and then continue to S3 or T4. You couldn't continue to S4, because that is not a building/woods hex. You must stop in S3 or T4, because you have used five MF and the one remaining MF is not enough to continue to another building/woods hex, although you have the option to go up to the first level of S3. Routing units cannot use Bypass.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;If you rout through Open Ground in the Normal Range of a Known enemy unit, you can be Interdicted. Interdiction cannot occur in a Location where a positive TEM applies, nor if Hindrance to that Location from the Interdictor's Location will result. The Interdictor cannot be CX, pinned, broken, or in Melee (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.532" class="topiclink">A10.532</a>). If you are Interdicted, you take a NMC. If you roll less than your Morale Level, you are okay and can continue routing. If you roll exactly equal to your Morale Level, you are pinned and must stop your rout in the Interdiction Location. If you roll higher than your Morale Level, you suffer Casualty Reduction, but any remaining HS may continue routing. An unbroken, friendly leader in your Location can usually add his leadership factor to your DR. &quot;Drill Sergeant, can a unit Interdict you more than once? If more than one unit Interdicts you, do you have to take a NMC for each one?&quot; Yes to the first question, no to the second. Interdiction is resolved per hexes traversed in LOS of an Interdictor, not by number of units capable of Interdicting in such a hex. One unit can Interdict any number of hexes and any number of routing units in each hex, but a routing unit takes only one NMC in each Interdicted hex, regardless of the number of enemy units Interdicting it in that hex (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.532" class="topiclink">A10.532</a>).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;To avoid Interdiction, a non-Disrupted routing unit may use Low Crawl (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.52" class="topiclink">A10.52</a>). This means a rout of only one hex, but is free of Interdiction in that hex. You may not Low Crawl ADJACENT to an enemy unit if you are in the process of leaving that unit's Location.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;If required to rout and you cannot do so legally, you are eliminated for Failure to Rout—or you might surrender instead. Surrender usually occurs when broken Infantry is forced to rout due to being ADJACENT to Known, Good Order, armed enemy Personnel, but cannot do so without resorting to Low Crawl or being subject to Interdiction (see <a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.21" class="topiclink">A20.21</a> for the exceptions).</p>
<p>Suppose two unconcealed enemy units capable of Interdicting are in T2 and U4. Where is the only hex that you can rout to from our position in 3U3? &quot;V2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, but that is Open Ground. What are your choices? &quot;Low Crawl to V2 or be Interdicted in V2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. If you Low Crawl, you end your RtPh in V2, broken, DM, but alive—even if only temporarily. If you rout and are not pinned by Interdiction in V2, you have three options. You can rout to V1, X1, or X3, since they are all an additional three MF away. If you rout to V1, you risk no further Interdiction and since you have two MF left, you can rout on to U1, V0, or W1. If you rout to W1 or X1, you'll suffer Interdiction again in W2 from U4, and you can continue only to X0. If you make it to X3—after being Interdicted again in W3 by the unit in T2—you must stop, since the only building/woods hex adjacent to you is W4. Continuing the rout into W4 would be routing toward the enemy unit in U4, which is not allowed even though that enemy unit is currently out of your LOS. You still remember the enemy's Location from the start of your RtPh. &quot;Drill Sergeant, if continuing the rout from X3 to W4 is not allowed, then why were we able to continue our rout from V1 to U1? Don't both constitute a move toward a Known enemy at the start of the RtPh?&quot; No. When we were routing to U1 from V1, both hexes were two hexes away from the Known enemy at T2—we didn't move closer. Routing from X3 to W4, on the other hand, decreases the range to the enemy in U4 from three hexes to two.</p>
<p>Suppose there are unconcealed enemy units in T2 and W4 instead. You must rout to V3 from U3, since that is the closest building/woods hex and W4 is not in your LOS. When you get there however, you must continue your rout because you discover the unit in W4. You must still rout toward a woods/building hex within six MF of your original position at the start of the RtPh—even though you have only four MF remaining. You cannot rout to W3 or V4 because they are ADJACENT to W4. You also cannot rout to U3 because of the enemy unit in T2. Your options are limited to V2 or U4. You cannot use Low Crawl because you have already routed one hex. If you had chosen Low Crawl originally, you could have gone only one hex in the RtPh—which would have been V3 where you would have been eliminated for Failure to Rout (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.5" class="topiclink">A10.5</a>). In U4 the stone walls protect you from Interdiction from both T2 and W4, so that is the better choice for continuing your rout with your third MF. You must finish your rout in T4 with the expenditure of your fourth and fifth MF. You cannot rout to V1 via V3-V2 because that would require an expenditure of six MF. Clearly, T4 is the closest available woods/building hex which you can rout to—although in a round-about way. Had no other woods/building hex been within six MF of your original position (U3), you would have been free of the requirement to move toward the nearest woods/building hex once you reached V3.</p>
<p>Things could be worse. If there are enemy units in T3, V1, and W4, you must rout to V3 from U3 as before, but once there you cannot rout anywhere without being ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit. You are therefore eliminated or captured for Failure to Rout. Remember: once you've chosen to Low Crawl, you cannot change your mind and opt to rout out of a Location that you've just discovered is ADJACENT to a Known, unbroken, armed enemy unit. It's too late—you're a goner.</p>
<p>Now let's suppose the only enemy unit is in T2. You can rout to V3 and continue to W4 which uses all six MF. Then the enemy moves unconcealed 4-6-7 squads into X3, V3, Y6, and S5 in his MPh. Your only rout now is to W8. You can rout to W5 despite moving closer to Y6, because Y6 is not in your LOS until you reach W5. You can then rout along the ridge to W7 and then into the woods at W8 because you're not moving closer to Y6. You're also protected from Interdiction by Height Advantage. You can't rout to U6 or U7 because they're closer to S5 which comes into your LOS when you enter W5. If there's another unconcealed enemy unit in W9, you cannot continue routing because you're out of MF, so you'd be eliminated or captured for ending your RtPh ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit. On the other hand however, you could have chosen to simply Low Crawl to W5, thus ending your RtPh there.</p>
<p>Let's go to the ground floor of M2 for some more examples. Suppose there's an unconcealed enemy unit in L1. You are required to rout because you are ADJACENT to it. You have a lot of options though. You can rout up the stairs to the first or second level of M2, or you can go to N1 or N2, or using the stairs, get to any level of those hexes. You can also rout out of the building altogether because that's the building that you started the RtPh in. Since, if you leave the building, you must still rout to the woods/building nearest your original position, you must rout to N0, L4, or O1. Those three hexes are all four MF away, while M5 is five MF and P1 and P2 are each six MF away.</p>
<p>Suppose that enemy unit is in M1 instead. You cannot rout to L1 or to the ground floor of N1, as both are ADJACENT to the enemy unit. You can rout up the stairs and to the first or second level of Nl since those levels are not directly connected (i.e., ADJACENT) to M1. You can alternatively rout to either of the two upper levels of M2, or to any level of N2. If you choose to disregard this building, you can rout to L4 which is the closest building/woods hex. Since it is four MF away, you can use the remaining MF to rout to M5, or upstairs to level 1 of L4. If neither the grain nor plowed fields are in effect (<a href="chb_chb15.htm#15.6" class="topiclink">B15.6</a>), you can instead rout to K1, J1, or J2, since they are four MF away also and no closer to the enemy unit.</p>
<p>Let's assume that you rout to the first level of M2. The enemy moves to the ground level of M2, and more unconcealed enemy units move to the ground level of N1 and N2. You can still rout up the stairs to the second level of M2 since that Location is not ADJACENT to the ground floor, or to either of the upper levels of N1 or N2 since there is no stairwell in either of those hexes and consequently they are not ADJACENT to the ground floor. Wherever you rout, you'd better rally fast because you're in real trouble. It won't be long before you run out of places to rout to, or succumb to a Mopping Up operation (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.153" class="topiclink">A12.153</a>). The advent of the Mopping Up rule in ASL makes routing to upper building levels much less effective; consequently, you should generally avoid climbing stairs when you're broken if you have any other alternative.</p>
<p>Take a break for chow and fall in on the bridge at 24F6. Squad, DISMISSED.</p>

<p>At ease. To stay in practice, we're going to practice more routing before we learn how to rally. Suppose we're broken and there is an enemy 4-6-7 in D5. We have to rout, but since we're on a bridge, we can only move to E6 or G7 (<a href="chb_chb6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">B6.4</a>). We can't rout to E6, because that's toward the enemy unit, so we must rout to G7. We can Low Crawl there and stop, or risk Interdiction and continue to the woods in F7. We'll do the latter, and will assume that we all passed our Interdiction NMC—a big assumption for you bozos.</p>
<p>Now an unconcealed enemy unit moves ADJACENT to us in F8 and the enemy in D5 vanishes. We become DM and must rout. It would be safe to rout INTO the gully in E7 or F6 to get out of the enemy's LOS and avoid Interdiction, but we must rout to the nearest woods or building, which in this case is 16, unfortunately. &quot;Drill Sergeant, we can get to F4 in six MF if we go via G7, F6, E6 and E5. I6 is also six MF away, so don't we have a choice?&quot; Just checking to see if you were awake, and apparently you were only half asleep. Yes, F4 would be a possible choice—except that there is a closer building/woods hex than either F4 or 16. We can reach J8 in five MF without ever shortening the range to the enemy unit. Fortunately, No Quarter is still in effect so we are not subject to surrender and can rout to J8 or Low Crawl to G7.</p>
<p>Let's try another example. You are broken IN F6 beneath the bridge, and the enemy is IN E7. You must rout You cannot be Interdicted in G6, even though the gully is Open Ground, because there is no LOS between E7 and G6. You could also rout directly to the brush in F5 on your way to the woods in either F4 or G5. You could not be Interdicted in F5 because the brush is not Open Ground and in any case is out of the LOS of the enemy IN E7.</p>
<p>You rout to G5 but our persistent enemy moves to F4 and is aided by another unconcealed enemy unit which moves to H6. You now have but one choice—you must rout to H4. Since you can't reach a woods/building hex with your six MF (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.51" class="topiclink">A10.51</a>), you can either stop in H4 or continue routing to H3,I4, or I5. You don't have to go to I4 or I5 in order to get to J4. Although J4 is the closest available building/woods hex it is more than six MF away and therefore does not have to be the goal of the rout. You choose H3. The enemy units move to G4 and I4 in their next MPh, so in your RtPh you rout to H2. The enemy in I4 then moves INTO H3, but now you don't have to rout because you're not in its LOS, even though adjacent. The enemy unit in G4 disappears, but another unconcealed enemy unit appears adjacent to you in I2, forcing you to rout because it has a LOS INTO the H2 gully and you're in Open Ground. You must rout toward the woods in F4, which is the closest building/ woods hex (five MF). You can enter G3 even though it is ADJACENT to the enemy in H3 because they are not Known to you until you enter G3. You don't Low Crawl because it would leave you ADJACENT to an enemy unit at the end of the RtPh. Therefore, you rout to F4, subject to Interdiction from I2 in both G3 and F3.</p>
<p>Suppose you're broken in H1 with unconcealed enemy units in G1 and I2. You can still rout to H2. It is not ADJACENT to I2 in the sense that a unit cannot move or advance directly from I2 to H2 because of the cliff. You can stop there via Low Crawl. Any continued Rout would risk Interdiction in H2 and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Let's check out the view from AA7 while still broken. An unconcealed enemy unit appears in Z6 and forces you to rout. The closest hexes you can rout to are the building in DD5 and the woods in CC9, both of which are 4½ MF away. Y8, Y9, Z9, and DD8 are all five MF away. DD5 is your best choice because you can rout to DD5 via the orchard in BB6 and the grain in CC6 without fear of Interdiction, because those hexes are not Open Ground. So you go to DD5. Now two more enemy units show up at DD4 and BBS. You can rout through DD6 to DD8 or FF7 without Interdiction because the unit in BBS has its LOS Hindered by the grain in CC6, making DD6 safe even though it is Open Ground, and the unit in Z6 is Hindered by the orchard in BB6. You could instead go to FF7, GG7, or GG4 which are also five MF away, but each route would be subject to interdiction in EE6 from DD4.</p>
<p>Okay, I guess you guys have enough experience at being broken. Let's see if we can teach you how to rally.</p>
<p>Rally is the most common way that broken units return to Good Order. Leaders and crews can rally themselves, as is signified by the box that encloses their broken Morale Level. A unit attempting to rally itself is always referred to as making a Self-Rally attempt, which is distinctly different from a normal rally attempt. A Self-Rally attempt always incurs a +1 DRM penalty. Both rally and Self-Rally require the rolling of two dice. If the sum of the DR after modification is equal to or less than your broken Morale Level, you have rallied. If you roll an Original 2 Rally DR, Heat of Battle (<a href="cha_cha15.htm#15.1" class="topiclink">A15.1</a>) occurs (unless Self-Rallying, in which case Leader Creation is possible; <a href="cha_cha18.htm#18.11" class="topiclink">A18.11</a>) but we won't get into that now. If you roll greater than your broken Morale Level, you just remain broken unless you roll an Original 12. An Original 12 DR eliminates a crew or HS, Reduces a squad to a HS, and wounds a leader—just like rolling 12 on a MC (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.64" class="topiclink">A10.64</a>). There are several modifiers to the Rally DR. If you are under DM, a +4 DRM applies. A rally attempt in a woods/building/pillbox/trench Location receives a -1 DRM. &quot;Drill Sergeant, what about lumberyards?&quot; They are like wooden buildings for just about all purposes except rally (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.211" class="topiclink">B23.211</a>), so you don't get a terrain DRM for attempting to rally in a lumberyard.</p>
<p>I am now going to attempt Self-Rally. I am in woods and under DM. What Original DR do I need to Self-Rally? &quot;4, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Correct. My broken Morale Level is 8 but I am subject to a +4 DRM (+1 [Self-Rally] -1 [terrain] +4 [DM] = +4). A leader's leadership DRM never applies to himself. My Original Self-Rally DR is a 7 so I don't rally, but the DM is removed at the end of the RPh if I'm not ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit.</p>
<p>You, as a squad/HS, may not attempt to Self-Rally unless you do so during your own Player Turn as the first MMC rally attempt of that Player Turn (<a href="cha_cha18.htm#18.11" class="topiclink">A18.11</a>). In addition, you cannot be Disrupted or in the same Location with a Good Order leader. If this Self-Rally attempt results in an Original 2 DR, you may also attempt Leader Creation (<a href="cha_cha18.htm#18.11" class="topiclink">A18.11</a>), but that's another story altogether. Otherwise, you can only rally with the assistance of a Good Order leader in the same Location. Since I am still broken and our commander has seen fit not to waste his once-per-Game Turn Self-Rally attempt on you, you too will remain broken but will lose your DM status at the end of the RPh if not ADJACENT to a Known enemy unit.</p>
<p>It is the next RPh and we are no longer DM, so I need an Original 8 Rally DR to Self-Rally. My Self-Rally DR is again a 7 and I rally. Now that I'm unbroken I can help you rally in this same RPh. Your broken Morale Level is 8, but the addition of the -1 terrain DRM for being in woods and my -1 leadership DRM will enable you to rally on an Original DR of 10 or less. Regardless of favorable DRM, if you roll an Original 12 you'll suffer Casualty Reduction.</p>
<p>Let's assume we're in EE8 and DM. It is harder to rally here since the brush doesn't qualify for the terrain DRM. I need an Original 3 or less to Self-Rally. However, if I succeed, you'll need only an Original 5 or less due to my leadership DRM and the absence of any Self-Rally. I fail my Self-Rally attempt so we all remain broken. You think that's funny, Mishcon? We'll see how funny it is when you clean out the latrines tonight! We are subsequently fired on again so we start the next RPh with DM, but a Good Order 9-2 leader has joined us. The 9-2 assists me so I am no longer penalized by a Self-Rally attempt, and I also get the benefit of the -2 leadership DRM, so I now need an Original 6 or less DR to rally.</p>
<p>Regardless of how I do, the 9-2 can also try to rally you. You now need a 6 or less also. If we fail to rally, we will still have the choice of retaining our DM so we can rout to a building/woods hex, or we can remove it— hoping to rally where we are. Usually, it is wise to remove the DM status. If we can avoid DM status before the next RPh, we will need only an Original 10 or less DR to rally thanks to the 9-2 leader.</p>
<p>I hope you can see how important leaders are. It's very common for units to break during combat and leaders are the most likely way of rallying them. Now let's try to put together the whole break-rout-rally cycle.</p>
<p>We are in W9. Three German 4-6-7 squads are in V7. They fire at us with 12 FP and a TEM/Hindrance DRM of 4-2. They roll an Original 6, which becomes an 8 after the DRM. This results in a 1MC which I pass and you fail—naturally. You are now a DM broken squad. You can remain in W9 since it is not Open Ground and no enemy units are ADJACENT, but you rout to a safer Location. I decide to accompany you on your rout. We must rout to the nearest woods/building hex which is Y9, U9, V10, or X10—all of which are three MF away. We rout to Y9 via X9, and continue to Z9 where we stop after using five of our six MF. In the following RPh I attempt to rally you. The total DRM is +2 (+4 [DM] -1 [terrain] -1 [leadership] = 4-2) so you need to roll an Original 6 or less to rally. You don't—of course.</p>
<p>Those same three German squads have moved to X9 where in their AFPh they fire at us again. They use the 6 column of the IFT with a +3 DRM for the stone building. They roll an Original 3 which becomes a 6 on the IFT and results in a 1MC. We all break in two separate DR, and you are Reduced to a 3-3-7 HS for failing a MC while already broken. Although we don't have to rout since we are neither ADJACENT to the enemy nor in open Ground, we can rout to, among other places, Z10 or Y8 which are the closest woods/building hexes, but they are the same distance from the enemy as we are so we may disregard them. Although Z10 is closer to us (2 MF) than Y8 (3½ MF), we can still choose to go to Y8 simply because Z10 is no farther from the enemy. Dismissing the closest building/woods hex for being no farther from the enemy does not disqualify other hexes from consideration that are also no farther from the enemy. Z7 is closer (3½ MF) than CC9 (4½ MF), so we choose to rout to Z7. We can rout no farther because we would have to leave woods/building terrain without directly entering other such terrain.</p>
<p>Since I am broken and DM, I need an Original DR of 4 or less to Self-Rally. I don't make it and therefore you don't get a chance to rally. Nor do we rally following our Player Turn. The enemy meanwhile moves to Y7 and Z8 where they automatically DM us again, and were it not for No Quarter would have again subjected us to surrender. So, we rout to the nearest woods—AA6—chancing Interdiction in AA7. We pass our respective separate Interdiction NMC but fail to rally. The enemy moves up to Z5 and AA7, forcing us to rout again. We rout to the building in DD5 via BB5 and CCS, avoiding Interdiction because Grain is not Open Ground.</p>
<p>I rally, but you don't, and the enemy moves up to CCS and DD6—forcing you to rout again since these No Quarter Huns aren't taking prisoners. I opt to accompany you via Voluntary Rout (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.711" class="topiclink">A10.711</a>). Our choices are to rout to GG4, risking Interdiction in EE5 and FF4, or to Low Crawl to EE5. We go for the woods and risk Interdiction. Since I am no longer broken and am accompanying you in the RtPh voluntarily, I no longer have my own Interdiction NMC— instead my life being subject to the results of your NMC - plus <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> I can aid you with my leadership. The Interdiction NMC DR for EE5 is an Original 7 which is reduced to a 6 by my leadership. So far so good. We continue into FF4 where the Original Interdiction DR is an 8. My leadership DRM saves us from Casualty Reduction, but the Final NMC DR of 7 still pins us in FF4. We may rout no farther in this RtPh and will doubtless be easy targets in the enemy's next fire phase. Rather than contemplate that dreary ending, let's call it a day.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, assemble in the street at 3O4 for Camouflage training. Squad DISMISSED.</p>
