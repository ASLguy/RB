<p>At ease. This afternoon you will learn how to conceal yourselves from the enemy, what the benefits of concealment are, and how you lose that concealment. First, let's get out of the road where everyone can see us. Enter the building in O5. Is there any enemy in sight? No? Good. We can become concealed, and mark the occasion by placing that cardboard concealment &quot;?&quot; marker on our collective heads.</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, doesn't this make us more conspicuous?&quot; It's not as good as being hidden, but if you can't be hidden it's certainly better than nothing. I don't want any one bellyaching about how heavy their &quot;?&quot; are. Carry them on top of you whenever you can; they're for your own good since they give you an edge in combat and help keep you alive.</p>
<p>You can gain concealment at the beginning of a game, before entry into a game as reinforcements, or at the end of your Player Turn. We will concentrate on gaining concealment during combat; in other words, at the end of your Player Turn.</p>
<p>To gain concealment you must be in Good Order, which basically means that you aren't broken or locked in Melee. A broken unit usually has someone yelling, wailing, or flopping around like a chicken with its head cut off—in short, without proper battlefield discipline. It can't hide from anybody. If you are in Melee with an enemy, you're likely to be making too much noise to be concealed.</p>
<p>It helps to be in Concealment Terrain to gain concealment (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">A12.12</a>). This includes buildings, rubble, woods, grain, brush, marsh, and orchards. It also includes being behind a bocage hexside, but only when all unbroken enemy units with a LOS to you trace that LOS through the bocage. If you are in Concealment Terrain and out of the LOS of all unbroken enemy units, you automatically become concealed at the end of your turn. If an enemy unit has a LOS to you, you cannot become concealed since you can be seen. Even one Good Order SMC in LOS is enough to deny you concealment. You can gain concealment if you are in the LOS of any number of enemy units as long as they are all broken; if just one of them is unbroken, you cannot become concealed.</p>
<p>If you are not in Concealment Terrain, you automatically gain concealment at the end of your Player Turn if you are out of the LOS of all unbroken enemy units, and there are no unbroken enemy units within 16 hexes of you (whether they are in your LOS or not).</p>
<p>There are two cases in which you must make a dr (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.122" class="topiclink">A12.122</a>) if you wish to gain concealment. If you are in Concealment Terrain in the LOS of unbroken enemy units, but all of them are more than 16 hexes away, you can attempt to become concealed. If you are in non-Concealment Terrain, out of the LOS of all unbroken enemy units, but within 16 hexes of at least one unbroken enemy unit, you can attempt to become concealed. Both cases depend on making a concealment dr or 5 or less. That sounds easy, but there are modifiers to the dr. The first drm depends on the size of the unit trying to hide. A leader adds +1, a HS +2, and a squad adds +3. With this drm I would have to roll an Original 4 or less to become concealed, but you would have to roll an Original 2 or less. A leader can use his leadership to help other units become concealed, but not himself. For example, if I am helping you, pointing out places where you can hide, you can become concealed with an Original dr of 3 or less. You are also helped by terrain. You subtract the TEM and the Hindrance of your terrain from the dr. There are also drm for being Lax or Stealthy but we'll ignore those for now.</p>
<p>What would you subtract from the dr if you are in a wooden building? &quot;Two, Drill Sergeant.&quot; In woods? &quot;One, Drill Sergeant.&quot; In an orchard? &quot;One, Drill Sergeant.&quot; In a crag? &quot;One, Drill Sergeant.&quot; No, a crag has both a TEM of one and a Hindrance of one. Try again. 'Two, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. This modifier depends only on terrain in the hex itself. Walls, Height Advantage, and other hexside only TEM (i.e., LOS-dependent TEM) have no effect on this drm.</p>
<p>As an exercise, take a close look at the following tactical situation at the end of a German's Player Turn. Which units automatically gain a &quot;?&quot;, which units must make a dr, what is the highest Original dr that they can roll and still become concealed, and which units cannot become concealed?</p>
<p>Here is the situation: U.S. Good Order squads in 3K7, M2 (ground level), M3, M10, P6, and a broken squad in S5 . The German units are as follows: G6: 7-0 leader &amp; HS; H5: squad; J1: HS; N1 first level: squad; Q4: 9-1 leader &amp; squad; R5 ground level: squad; R6: HS; S6: squad; T5: 8-0 leader &amp; HS; U2: squad; W4: squad; AA7: HS; BB5: broken squad; DD9: 8-1 leader &amp; HS; EE10: squad; EE6: HS; FF5: 9-2 leader &amp; squad; FF9: squad; GG5: squad. Take ten minutes, look at the situation, and write down your answers. &quot;Drill Sergeant, this is pretty complicated—couldn't you draw us a picture?&quot; No, trainee—I'm no artist and this isn't an Art Appreciation class. This is &quot;hands-on&quot; training—which means YOU place markers on a map and figure it out. I didn't ask you to do it from memory! The pretty pictures are in the ASL rulebook—we're not interested in making this easy for you. If you're going to learn— you'll have to get out the pieces and check LOS yourself. Now do it!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> The units that can roll for concealment (and their necessary Original dr) are listed below. Mark them with a CX counter temporarily to symbolize that their concealment gain is dependent on a successful dr. A successful dr will conceal the following units: the 7-0 in G6 (5 or less), the HS in G6 (4 or less), the squad in H5 (3 or less), the leader in Q4 (4 or less), the squad in Q4 (3 or less), the squad in S6 (2 or less), the leader in T5 (4 or less), the HS in T5 (3 or less), the HS in EE6 (3 or less), the 9-2 in FF5 (4 or less), and the squad in FF5 (4 or less).</p>
<p>The units that cannot gain concealment are: the HS in J1 (LOS of M3), the HS in R6 (LOS of P6), the squad in W4 (LOS of K7), the squad in BBS (broken), the squad in EE10 (LOS of K7 and not in Concealment Terrain), and all the U.S. units (not their Player Turn). All the other units gain &quot;?&quot; automatically.</p>
<p>Even though the units in EF5 are out of LOS of all enemy units, they are in non-Concealment Terrain within exactly 16 hexes of the unbroken enemy unit in P6, and must make a Concealment dr. GG5 is 17 hexes away so the unit there becomes concealed without a dr. The units in Q4 are in open terrain regardless of the hedge and must roll for concealment.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to gain a &quot;?&quot;, you need to know what good it does you. First, it keeps the enemy from knowing exactly what is under the &quot;?&quot;. You can look under your &quot;?&quot; to see what you have, but you may not peek under an enemy &quot;?&quot;. I might also mention that you cannot inspect an enemy stack unless you have a Good Order unit with a LOS to it (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.16" class="topiclink">A12.16</a>). &quot;Drill Sergeant, can you have both concealed and unconcealed units in the same hex?&quot; Yes. In that case, put the unconcealed units on top, with the concealed units on the bottom and the &quot;?&quot; in between.</p>
<p>A second big advantage of being concealed is that it makes enemy fire less effective. In fact, FP against a concealed unit is reduced to half strength. This is in addition to all other forms of halving fire penalties. What if a pinned unit fires at Long Range at a concealed unit? How much is its FP reduced? &quot;It is divided by eight, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. How is it reduced against a non-concealed unit? &quot;Quartered, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good. Concealment also helps you gain Ambush status when you first enter CC, and can help you bag routing units who head toward you as they move to the closest woods/building hex not &quot;knowing&quot; you're there until you reveal yourself (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.533" class="topiclink">A10.533</a>). Concealment has many advantages, but we'll concentrate on its FP effects for the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, if a concealed unit is stacked with an unconcealed unit, how is FP affected?&quot; The concealed unit has the FP halved against it, while the unconcealed unit doesn't. This means that the attack would be resolved on different columns on the IFT, but with the same DR. For example, suppose that there are two enemy squads in the woods in P5, one concealed and one not. Since we are in O5, you use Point Blank Fire. You have 14 FP against the unconcealed squad and seven FP against the concealed squad. My leadership negates the effect of the woods. If you roll a 9, the unconcealed squad must take a NMC, while the concealed squad is unaffected.</p>
<p>You see how useful concealment is to have, and you know how to get it. Concealment is easy to lose (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.14" class="topiclink">A12.14</a>), however. A unit loses concealment if it becomes broken or Reduced, regardless of the proximity of enemy units. If a unit is within LOS of a Good Order enemy unit, regardless of range, it loses its concealment if it is attacked and suffers a PTC or worse.</p>
<p>The unit must be in Good Order to make you lose concealment once you have it; it needs only to be unbroken to prevent you from gaining concealment in the first place. A Good Order unit is one that is neither broken, berserk, captured, nor in Melee.</p>
<p>If a Good Order enemy unit is within 16 hexes of you, and also has a LOS to you, there are many more ways to lose concealment. If you fire a weapon, you lose concealment. This includes your inherent FP or SW. If you are a leader, you lose your concealment if you try to rally a unit. You lose concealment if you attack in CC, barring a successful Ambush (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">A11.4</a>). You also lose concealment if you enter an Open Ground hex or use non-Assault Movement. To keep your concealment while moving, you have to move real slow. At least one unit in your Location loses concealment if an enemy unit attempts to enter your Location (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.15" class="topiclink">A12.15</a>). Remember, you must be within 16 hexes of a Good Order enemy unit that has a LOS to you to lose concealment due to these actions.</p>
<p>Let's test your knowledge of concealment. Suppose there is an enemy Good Order unit in 3M5. You are still in O5, concealed. If the enemy squad fires at you and gets no effect, do you retain your concealment? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; What if the attack results in a PTC which you pass? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Wrong. You do lose your concealment to a PTC— whether you pass it or not. Suppose that you fire at the only Good Order enemy unit in your LOS and break or eliminate it? Do you lose your concealment? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right—because the enemy unit was in Good Order when you fired at it. However, if that unit was already broken when you fired at it you wouldn't have lost your concealment.</p>
<p>Suppose that the enemy squad is in Good Order but you are broken. I am concealed but I try to rally you. Do I lose my concealment? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. See what a leader has to give up for his men? You there, go fetch me a drink of water. Now, suppose that both you and the enemy squad are concealed. You move into the road in N5. Do you lose your concealment? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Does the enemy squad, since you moved ADJACENT to it? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, but it must be momentarily revealed to make you lose your concealment (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.14" class="topiclink">A12.14</a>). Suppose it doesn't fire at you, and chooses to remain concealed. You attempt to enter its Location in M5. Does it lose its concealment? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right, and what happens to you? &quot;We stay in N5 and end our movement, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Sort of ... actually you entered M5 and the MF you paid to do so are still expended—but in N5 where they make you subject to new Defensive First Fire/Residual FP (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">A8.2</a>). Now suppose that instead of one squad, there are three squads and a leader in M5, all concealed. If you tried to enter M5, who loses concealment? &quot;One unit or more, chosen by Random Selection, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Outstanding.</p>
