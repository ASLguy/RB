By now you chowderheads have had some experience with SW and fired a machine gun or two. Mortars are a lot like machine guns, but can also be very different. We're going to look at some of those differences now. Meet me inside the building at 2I9.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><img src="dm60mtr.gif" width="59" height="59" alt="dm60mtr" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> FALL IN! Let me reintroduce you to the M2 60mm mortar. You all probably remember this beauty from Day One, when we got to lug it up and down 2I8. Remember what a bad time you had carrying a 5PP SW? &quot;Yeah, but it would have been easier if you'd lent us an extra PP Sarge.&quot; Aww, Youse, was it too heavy for you? &quot;Well, not so heavy as much as just awkward, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That's right, but the lesson was one you won't forget now, was it? There's another trick we could have done. Here, take the mortar, push on that tab, and twist the barrel...see? A mortar can be dismantled (dm) (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.8" class="topiclink">A9.8</a>), the same way most other heavy SW can be dm. You can't fire a dismantled mortar, but it's easier to carry. We replace the M2 MTR counter with an M2 dm MTR counter. This shows us that it isn't ready to be fired. Do you notice any other difference on this counter? &quot;The PP is down to 3, instead of 5, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Very good. Light mortars, like this M2, can be dm to halve their PP—fractions rounded up, of course. Larger mortars between 76 and 82mm also can be dm'ed—this makes them into a ½&quot; counter that you can carry just like any other SW. If you pass around the pieces and ammo boxes, then a squad like you can carry this one at normal speed, even without any help from a leader.</p>
<p>A dm weapon can be assembled either during your PFPh or your DFPh. But you can only dismantle a mortar during these phases if you haven't shot it. Assembly takes some time, and counts as if you've used a SW during that phase. Assembling or dm'ing a mortar counts as using a SW, so you guys could fire your inherent FP during the phase—unless you assemble two mortars, or assemble a mortar and fire another SW.</p>
<p>Your commander also has a choice before a battle—if he wants you to enter a combat area with any of your eligible weapons dm, he can. But if the scenario card specifies a weapon is dm, then it must enter dm. Meet me at 2E2, and be there within five minutes.</p>
<p><img src="81mtr.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="81mtr" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><img src="dm81mtr.gif" width="59" height="60" alt="dm81mtr" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Large mortars are easier to get into awkward places than most Guns. Unlike other Guns, you can take a large mortar (if dm) into a Crag (<a href="chb_chb17.htm#17.4" class="topiclink">B17.4</a>), Graveyard (<a href="chb_chb18.htm#18.43" class="topiclink">B18.43</a>), or Entrenchment (<a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.1" class="topiclink">B27.1</a>), reassemble it, and fire from there. You can also take a dm mortar ≤ 82mm onto the roof of a building, assemble it, and fire it from up there (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.85" class="topiclink">B23.85</a>), if you're fighting in an area that has roof access. You aren't allowed to fire any mortar from inside a building at all (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.423" class="topiclink">B23.423</a>) [EXC: roofless factory (<a href="cho_cho5.htm#5.45" class="topiclink">O5.45</a>)], including huts for you grunts that will be heading to the Pacific. Of course, you could fire any mortar from a lumberyard (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.211" class="topiclink">B23.211</a>) or rubble—even if that rubble was formerly the upper level of a building.</p>
<p><img src="60mtr+dm.gif" width="113" height="57" alt="60mtr+dm" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, here in 2E2, let's assemble our mortar. Replace the dm counter with the original M2 MTR counter. And now let's look at the counter. What information do you see? &quot;It's back up to 5 PP, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good eye. &quot;It's 60mm, and only fires HE.&quot; Close—an over-scored Caliber Size indicate that it isn't allowed to fire AP (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">C2.21</a>). &quot;Are the numbers in brackets its range?&quot; Yes, a mortar is an Indirect Fire weapon (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.1" class="topiclink">C.1</a>) that has a minimum and maximum range. The last number in the brackets is its maximum range, and the first number is its minimum range. &quot;It has a Multiple ROF of 3.&quot; That's something to remember— mortars often have high rates of fire. Even if they aren't very accurate or deadly, they can get lucky eventually just because they keep firing and firing. A mortar can even change targets on subsequent ROF shots. Anything else? &quot;What's the asterisk next to the caliber mean, Sarge?&quot; That means our mortar has a short barrel length and suffers To Hit penalties for firing at longer ranges (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">C4.11</a>l; the Brass have indicated that the rules about barrel length apply to certain SW, including mortars).</p>
<p>Anything else? Has anyone tried turning the counter over yet? Besides the usual information on breaking and repairing a SW, there are two special notes for the M2. First, it can fire Illuminating Round (PR) ammo, and this might save you some enchanted evening. Second, the M2 mortar can fire WP in any battle taking place in 1945 (or, as an early Christmas present, the U.S. gets WP in December 1944 if you are in any of the Kampfgruppe Peiper battles <a href="chp_chpkgpssr.htm#ssr16" class="topiclink">[KGP SSR 16]</a>). I'll describe WP in more detail when we talk about special ammunition.</p>
<p>Is that it? &quot;Yes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; NO! IT IS NOT! Always, ALWAYS read up on any weapon or vehicle you're going to take out in the field— even if it's just a SW. If you'd checked <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanordnancenotes.htm#1" class="topiclink">Chapter H about this weapon</a>, you'd also see that you can exchange three M2 60mm mortars for a 4 FP Offboard Artillery module, complete with a radio or field phone. This gets into rules we'll discuss some other day, but it's important for a commander to remember he has options. And that you should always read your operator's manual.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, the M2 mortar is a ½&quot; counter, so it is a SW and not a Gun, even if it is considered ordnance because it uses the To Hit (TH) table. This means that your commander thinks any infantry is qualified to fire this thing, Heaven help us. Almost all ½&quot; SW do not require a specially trained crew to fire it at full effectiveness—except for American RCL and all 37* INF weapons, plus the Japanese always require a trained crew to fire a MMG, HMG, or ATR at full effectiveness (<a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.611" class="topiclink">G1.611</a>). The fact that we have a SW instead of a Gun says we don't have a CA when we set up or fire our mortar—this is light enough that we can turn and fire it in any direction with no penalty (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">A9.21</a>).</p>
<p>Like a MG, a squad can fire a mortar and still use its inherent FP. Unlike a MG, though, you cannot add your inherent FP to the results of a mortar's attack (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.351" class="topiclink">A7.351</a>), even if you fire at the same target. Since mortars are SW, a squad can fire two mortars (or one mortar and another SW) instead of using its inherent FP. Likewise, a half-squad can fire a mortar instead of using its inherent FP. If you've got a lot of leaders and heroes with nothing better to do, two SMC can team up to fire a mortar at full effect. And one SMC can fire a mortar alone, but he loses any chance for Multiple ROF (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">C9.2</a>). If you moved the mortar this turn, you can't fire your mortar during the AFPh, either (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.41" class="topiclink">A4.41</a>), and that includes just changing Location within a hex. If you moved into a Location and Recovered a mortar during your MPh, you COULD fire it during the AFPh so long as you didn't move the mortar, but without ROF.</p>
<p><img src="60mtrmalf.gif" width="59" height="58" alt="60mtrmalf" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Mortars, like all weapons, are subject to breakdown. No, Nixon, that is not the same as dismantling it; it means it doesn't work any more. Most mortars have an inherent B12 (and so do not have a Breakdown Number (B#) printed on the counter), meaning that they malfunction on an Original To Hit DR of 12. When that happens, the mortar is inverted and cannot fire again until it is repaired, although if you had hit with an Original 12 (unlikely, but possible) that attack would still be resolved.</p>
<p>Look on the back of the counter again. What do you see besides the Special Ammo information? Petersen? &quot;Uh, an R1 in the upper left and an X6 in the lower right.&quot; What else? Anyone see a big white X? Sometimes the obvious gets overlooked. The white X means you can't fire the mortar till you repair it. The R1 means you can repair it during the RPh with a Repair dr (no drm apply) of 1, while the X6 means a Repair dr of 6 eliminates the mortar. This is true for all SW mortars and most ⅝&quot; mortars also; indeed, for most weapons in general. Some rare ⅝&quot; mortars (like some other Guns) don't have a white X on the back. Any guesses what that means? &quot;It won't malfunction, Drill Sergeant?&quot; You should be so lucky, Repetti. No, it means those Guns must be unlimbered to fire at full effectiveness (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.2" class="topiclink">C10.2</a>) and you use a special Malfunction counter when they break. Maybe some of you will go on to Advanced Ordnance training one day where they go into material like this. You guys sure aren't ready for it yet, though. Enough chatter. Let's try this baby out.</p>
<p><img src="467+foxhole.gif" width="126" height="71" alt="467+foxhole" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Standing at 2E2, and looking due east, how far can you see? &quot;Hex 2Q2, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That's right. How far away is that? &quot;12 hexes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Good—and within easy range of our mortar. We'll put a simulated German 4-6-7 squad on top of the hill in 2Q2. For their sake, we'll let them set up in a foxhole. Set the range of your mortar to 480 meters, and let's fire off a round during the PFPh.</p>
<p>PHOOP!</p>
<p>Unlike firing your inherent FP or a MG, firing a mortar is a two step process. We have to roll To Hit (TH) the target, and then roll to determine how effective the hit was on the IFT. First we look at the <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C3 To Hit Table</a>. Under TARGET TYPE/RANGE, we look under the 7-12 column, and cross reference that with the Area (Mortar, SMOKE) Target Type. You should get a 7. &quot;Why is the seven red, Drill Sergeant? I thought in 1944 the Americans got black TH numbers.&quot; Normally that's true. But mortars are Indirect Fire weapons, and always use Area Target Type for the TH charts (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">C3.33</a>). For Area Target Types, everybody gets a red number.</p>
<p>Next we read down through <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C4 Gun &amp; Ammo Basic To Hit Number Modifications</a>, and see what modifiers apply at this range. We have a * Gun (0 modifier until your range is 13 or more hexes). Otherwise, no modifiers apply to us here so our Modified TH Number is 7. In comparison, the German light mortar is 50mm, and right away we see an advantage the American mortar has over its German counterpart—at ranges greater than 12 hexes, the smaller caliber of the German mortar suffers an additional reduction in its Modified TH Number.</p>
<p>Now we read through the <a href="tables_c5firer-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C5 Firer Based DRM</a>. Before you start, notice the &quot;dagger'' footnote (†) reference says some of these cases do not apply to Area Target Types. That's us and our mortar. Let's go through the checklist, skipping the daggered modifiers:</p>
<p>• Case A: Firer outside CA—doesn't apply, because light mortars don't care about CA.</p>
<p>• Case B: Fire in AFPh—we're not doing that just now.</p>
<p>• Case C: Bounding Firer—that only applies to vehicles.</p>
<p>• Case D: Pinned Firer/Spotter—we're not pinned.</p>
<p>• Case F: Intensive Fire—not an option for SW like our Light mortar (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">C5.6</a>), but could be for mortars on a ⅝&quot; counter.</p>
<p>• Case H: Captured/Non-qualified Infantry—by the time we're done here, you'll be qualified to use an M2. This would apply only if we're using another nationality's mortar or a larger mortar on a ⅝&quot; counter.</p>
<p>• Case I: Buttoned Up AFV—certainly not a squad out on a sunny summer day.</p>
<p>• Other: None apply. We'll talk about Spotted Fire later.</p>
<p>Total DRM for Firer-Based Hit Determination: +0</p>
<p>Okay, we're doing well. For all the modifiers that we can control, we have suffered no bad ones. Now we look at the <a href="tables_c6target-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C6 Target-Based DRM table</a>, and see what the defender has done to avoid our fire:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case J: Moving/Motion Vehicle or Dashing Infantry—our target certainly isn't Dashing, nor a vehicle.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Cases J<span class="f_Exponent">1</span>-J<span class="f_Exponent">2</span>: Defensive First Fire vs Moving Vehicle—not shooting at a moving vehicle that just came into sight.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Cases J<span class="f_Exponent">3</span>-J<span class="f_Exponent">4</span>: FFNAM/FFMO—our target isn't moving for our benefit, either.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case K: vs Concealed Target or Area Fire—doesn't apply. For us this only applies if we have a concealed target. Area Fire (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">C.4</a>) is NOT the same thing as Area Target Type (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">C3.33</a>); just because we're using the Area Target Type doesn't mean we must use Area Fire.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case M: Bore Sighted Location—doesn't apply to us. We'll talk about Bore Sighting later.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case N: Acquired Target—this is our first shot, so it doesn't apply yet.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case O: Target using Hazardous Movement—doesn't apply.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case P: Target Size Modifier—infantry doesn't have a Target Size.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case Q: TEM—Note that TEM doesn't apply here. Don't smile too much though because we apply the TEM to the IFT results if and when we do score a hit.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Case R: LOS Hindrance—no hindrance between here and there.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Other: None apply.</p>
<p>Total DRM for Target-Based Hit Determination: +0</p>
<p>There's one other thing to notice. The <a href="tables_c6target-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C6 table</a> has a triangle (∆) in the upper right hand corner, and <a href="tables_c5firer-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C5 table</a> does not. That means I can apply my Leader Modifier to your Firer-Based Hit Determination chances on the TH DR, and any defending leader cannot modify our roll. I'll throw in my -1 modifier now. So what do you need? &quot;A 7 base to hit, +0 Firer Based DRM, +0 Target Based DRM, -1 DRM for Leadership. We need to roll an 8 or less, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That's right. And don't look so disappointed that it's only an eight—just try it. Roll the dice.</p>
<p><img src="acq-1large.gif" width="70" height="73" alt="ACQ-1large" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />What did you roll? &quot;A nine. We missed.&quot; Wait, get in the habit of checking your dice. What did you roll on the colored die? &quot;It's a three, so we keep our ROF.&quot; Right, and you get another bonus besides a second shot. You also get an Acquisition counter. Choose a ⅝&quot; Acquisition counter out of your boxes—they look like a gun sight. We use ⅝&quot; Acquisition to mark Area Target Type Acquisition, and ½&quot; markers for Acquisition using Infantry or Vehicular Target Types. If you have many weapons putting many Acquisition counters on the table, you can choose an Acquisition counter that has the same Identity (A, B, C, and so on) as the weapon that it applies to. You might also choose one color of Acquisition counters to represent M2 mortars, if lots of different Ordnance are acquiring targets.</p>
<p>Now put the Acquisition counter, with the &quot;-1&quot; side up, on top of our target hex. If you remember Case N from the Target-Based Hit Determination table, you see the -1 DRM applies to your now-acquired target. Presumably you have an idea of where your previous shot landed, and future shots can be corrected onto your target. So for your second shot, you get this new modifier. What do you need to hit now? &quot;We needed an 8 last time, and the only change to the DRM is the -1 Acquisition. So now we need a 9?&quot; See? It just keeps getting better. Roll the dice.</p>
<p>&quot;We rolled a 5, but the colored die is a 4.&quot; Okay, you lost ROF for this turn, but you scored a hit on the target. Before we figure the hit results, flip your Area Acquisition over to the &quot;-2&quot; side for future shots. That's as good a DRM as you can get from Target Acquisition, and now next turn you'll need a 10 to hit. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>But now that we've gotten a hit, we need to figure out what sort of damage we've done to the target. Pull out the IFT, and look across the FP row. Each FP is followed by a slash and number, and the one we're interested in is the 8/60 column. This means our 60mm mortar has the equivalent FP of an 8 attack—almost. Because we're using Area Target Type, the FP for our mortar is halved to a 4. Does our target get any terrain modifiers in 2Q2? &quot;+2 for the foxhole?&quot; Yep. &quot;+1 for Height Advantage?&quot; No, HA never applies if you already have any positive modifier terrain bonus. And if you read <a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">B10.31</a> carefully, it says HA applies to &quot;... any unit receiving Direct Fire...&quot; and we are using Indirect Fire. Also, I can't offer you any Leadership Modifier because I can only apply it to your TH calculation (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.531" class="topiclink">A7.531</a>)—can't use me twice. Here's a quick opportunity to look at what might be shooting back at us someday. A German 50mm mortar would be on the 6/50 column, then halved to the 2 column. Not exactly as effective as our American mortar. &quot;Weren't these originally designed in France, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Get back to work, Ferraro.</p>
<p>Having finally scored a hit on our target, we resolve the damage on the IFT. Roll the dice. &quot;We got a 7, +2 for TEM makes it a Final 9 on the 4 FP column. No effect.&quot; Well, not exciting. Most light mortar shots aren't though. And remember, unless that German squad does something, we get &quot;To Hit&quot; it on a 10 or less now that his hex is acquired, and with our Multiple ROF it can't count on a turn going by without us hitting for some effect.</p>
<p>Let's go to the German's turn, and assume the squad has been gracious enough to stay put in its foxhole. Fire again during our DFPh. What do you need to hit now? &quot;Only DRM that's changed is the Acquisition, so now we need a 10.&quot; Outstanding. Roll the dice. &quot;A five, and this time the colored die is 1.&quot; Good. Now roll on IFT column 4 with a +2 DRM. &quot;Rolled a 4, +2 makes it a NMC.&quot; Excellent. Let's say the German squad rolls an 8 and breaks. Now you get to fire again with your ROF. &quot;Still need a 10. We roll a 2!&quot;</p>
<p>Good shot. Not only is a 2 a hit, but you've scored a Critical Hit (CH) (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">C3.7</a>). Now we'll make the squad regret staying in those foxholes. For mortars, the benefits to a CH are all modifiers to the IFT resolution. Instead of halving our FP (it was 8 halved to 4), we now double the FP (8 doubled to 16). Also, any TEM is now a minus to the DRM instead of a plus. So now the foxhole gives the defender a -2 TEM instead of the usual +2.</p>
<p>If we had gotten bonuses for FFNAM/FFMO (Cases J3 and J4), they would stay negative (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">C3.71</a>). An Airburst would also stay negative, but we'll talk about those later. If there had been multiple targets in the hex, a Critical Hit would only affect one of them (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.74" class="topiclink">C3.74</a>)—chosen by Random Selection. Everybody else in the hex, barring any ties on the Random Selection, would be hit with halved FP (8 halved to 4) and normal TEM.</p>
<p>Rolling a 2 TH is considered a CH only if you could have hit your target had you rolled a 3 or better—if you needed to roll a 2 or less just to hit, then you need to roll a subsequent dr. If the subsequent dr is a 1, you do indeed score a CH. Otherwise, on a dr of 2-6, you just score a normal hit (2-3 if you needed less than 2 to hit).</p>
<p>So now we roll on the IFT in the 16 column, with a -2 DRM for the reversed TEM of being in a foxhole. Roll away. &quot;We got an 8—with double fours.&quot; You're worried about Cowering? Don't. Ordnance rolls on the IFT are immune to Cowering (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.9" class="topiclink">A7.9</a>). Your 8 minus 2 for terrain gives us a 2MC. Jerry rolls another 8; the squad misses its morale check and reduces to a broken half-squad. Here we see the true lethality of a high ROF. It can cause multiple morale checks before your opponent gets to rout away. Useful to keep in mind, especially if you get the chance to fire at a single target with multiple mortars.</p>
<p>As if the Critical Hit wasn't enough, we still have ROF Roll again. &quot;A 3!&quot; This mortar is smoking! The only bad thing about having a great day with ROF is that it can draw some unwanted attention. All this rolling To Hit and rolling on the IFT could lead to some enemy Sniper attacks. But don't let me rain on this parade—figure your shot. &quot;We have a 4 column +2 DRM on the IFT, and roll a 4. Goes to 6, a NMC.&quot; Okay. Jerry rolls 9. Not his day for morale checks. His half-squad is Casualty Reduced, and is removed from play. We still have our ROF, but now we're out of targets to fire at, so we'll save ammo and let the phase end.</p>
<p><img src="acq-1large.gif" width="70" height="73" alt="ACQ-1large" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> There are a couple of lessons to always remember when you're firing a mortar. A mortar's Area Acquisition is based on the hex you've targeted. If the enemy leaves the target hex, you can't track him. Instead, you keep your Acquisition on the hex he just left. You can even use the Area Target Type to acquire a hex that has no enemy in it, and thereby acquire a hex you think the enemy might be headed for—or maybe the hex could have hidden enemy units stashed away. The only thing you need to worry about is enemy Snipers and Malfunctioning the mortar.</p>
<p>If you fire the mortar at another hex, you lose the Area Acquisition you had before on the first hex and start gaining Acquisition on the new target hex. A word of warning—and another difference between mortars and MG—if you fire your inherent FP at anyone, even the same target you fired your mortar at, you lose your Target Acquisition (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">C6.5</a>). The choice is yours—keep shooting your mortar with its increased accuracy, or blast them with your tommyguns. If you really want to use your inherent FP, use it in your friendly fire phase before you ever fire your mortar. That way, you get to shoot and gain Acquisition, at least for that turn. Next turn, you could fire your mortar with its new Acquisition, then think about firing your inherent FP. Of course, if you fire your FP without a leader, there is the danger that you could Cower. And if you do Cower, you and all your SW will be marked with a Final Fire counter (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.9" class="topiclink">A7.9</a>), and you will lose your chance to fire your mortar.</p>
<p>This would be a good time to mention Bore Sighting (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">C6.4</a>), which you might remember seeing in Case M on the Target-Based Hit Determination modifiers. If your current scenario makes you the Scenario Defender (check your Index!), you can Bore Sight your Mortars (plus lots of other weapons). You write down the mortar, its possessing unit, and the hex it is Bore Sighted on. The target hex must be within a range of 16 hexes. So long as you don't move the mortar to a different hex or give it to some other unit, you can keep your Bore Sighted hex in your sights and get a -2 DRM on your TH roll—even if you fire your inherent FP or the mortar at a target in a Location other than your Bore Sighted one. Bore Sighting cannot be combined with Acquisition, though. Think of it as a pre-acquired target hex—with a little more versatility.</p>
<p>Board 2 is a little claustrophobic for people trying to see far and shoot farther. Let's dm the M2, clean it, fall out for chow, and assemble at 24B3 in an hour. DISMISSED!</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p><img src="467+hmg.gif" width="112" height="60" alt="467+HMG" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />At ease. You probably remember some of the interesting terrain we have here on board 24 from earlier in your training. This afternoon we're going to study some of the more unusual tactics and terrain conditions that can affect a mortar's performance. Assemble the mortar.</p>
<p>Say we have seen a German squad armed with a HMG at level 2 of 24V3. Thinks its the cat's pajamas up there, in that stone building with a commanding view over most of the battlefield. But out here, we're outside of its weapon range unless it has a leader to direct its fire (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">A9.4</a>). And the squad's within ours. Let's take a shot at that unit.</p>
<p>PHOOP!</p>
<p><img src="concealger.gif" width="61" height="61" alt="concealger" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />Check the <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C3 table</a>. Range? &quot;Twenty hexes, Drill Sergeant.&quot; That gives us a base of 8 to hit. <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">Table C4</a> tells us that firing a * Gun will give us a -1 right off the bat, so the Modified TH Number goes down to 7.</p>
<p>Run through the <a href="tables_c5firer-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C5 DRM</a>, and tell me what applies. &quot;Nothing, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Right. What does <a href="tables_c6target-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">table C6</a> give us? &quot;We can see over the building in 24N3, right?&quot; Right. C6 gives us no DRM, either.</p>
<p>So what's our chance TH? &quot;Modified base DR of 7, +0 DRM for C5, +0 DRM for C6, and a -1 DRM from your leadership.&quot; Yeah, I'll help you with this shot. You need to roll 8 or less. Throw the dice. &quot;We got a 5, colored die is 1.&quot; Now let's see what effect we have on these Krauts. Check the IFT, and add +3 for the stone building. &quot;A 4 FP +3, and we roll a 6, goes to 9. No effect.&quot; But I see you marking the target hex with your -1 Acquisition counter, and loading for another shot because you maintained ROF. Very good.</p>
<p>Roll again, and call out your DRM. &quot;Modified base DR of 7, +0 DRM for C5, -1 DRM for C6 with our Acquisition, -1 DRM for your leadership. We need to roll a 9 or less.&quot; Right. &quot;We roll a 9, colored die is 3.&quot; And the results? &quot;Roll on the 4 column of the IFT, +3 for stone, we roll a 3, goes to 6. Jerry takes a NMC.&quot; Excellent. Say he rolls and stands firm. Take your next shot. &quot;Modified base DR of 7, +0 for C5, -2 for our Acquisition on C6, -1 DRM for leadership. We need a 10 or less. We roll a 6, colored die is 5. No more ROF.&quot; And what do you do after you hit? &quot;Roll a 4 on the IFT, goes to 7. PTC for Jerry.&quot; The squad rolls, and is pinned. End of your PFPh, unless you want to fire your inherent FP at something and lose your Acquisition. &quot;No way, Drill Sergeant!&quot; Good choice.</p>
<p>Just to make things more interesting, let's say that on the German's turn, two Concealed squads move into the building at 24V3—one on Level 0, one on Level 1. Now it's our DFPh, and we shoot again. Can we hit the new units? Anyone? Okay, it's an interesting situation. You're probably concerned about losing your Acquisition by changing targets. That won't happen because Area Acquisition covers the entire hex. Anything else? &quot;We can see where the Concealed squad moved into Level 1, but can we even see Level 0 over there Drill Sergeant?&quot; Well, no you can't, at least from here. It's hidden behind Level 1 of the building in hex 24N3. But that doesn't matter with our mortar. Remember, we're firing at the hex and not a specific Location in that hex. Potentially, we can affect everyone and everything in that hex by using Area Target Type, whether they are friend or foe (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">C3.33</a>).</p>
<p>Two things will modify our shot. The new Concealed squads will be harder to hit, and they will certainly get better cover from all those floors of stone building over their heads. But we can still affect them with the same dice rolls that affect the HMG squad up on Level 2.</p>
<p>We start with the same TH DRM for the squad on Level 2. What other TH DRM apply to the squad at Level 1? &quot;Case K, vs Concealed Target?&quot; Bingo. He now has a +2 TH DRM. We roll To Hit the hex only once, and apply the appropriate modifiers to each target in the hex. We may hit the guys on Level 2 and miss the guys on Level 1. Because the guys on level 0 are out of our LOS, we only hit them if we hit the hardest target we can see. In other words, if we score a hit on the guys in Level 1, we hit everyone. Fire when ready, and for now keep track only of the modifiers for the HMG unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Modified base DR of 7, +0 DRM for C5, -2 DRM for our Acquisition on 24V3, -1 DRM for leadership. We need a 10 or less. We roll a 6, colored die is 5. We have no ROF.&quot; Okay, so the squad upstairs gets hit. How about the Level 1 boys? &quot;Our roll of 6, +2 for Case K, but -2 for Acquisition and -1 for leadership is also a hit.&quot; And because we hit the squad at Level 1 (our hardest target), we also hit the unseen squad at Level 0. Now for the effect. &quot;We roll a 3 on the IFT, +3 for the stone building gives us a NMC against the Level 2 Germans.&quot; Jerry rolls 4, and stands firm. Okay, now let's see what the effect is on the guys on level 1. Even though they are Concealed, we don't halve the firepower of our indirect fire. Our penalty was already paid when we figured them to be harder to hit (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.13" class="topiclink">A12.13</a>). But because they are on a lower floor of a building, they get an additional +1 IFT DRM per floor above them (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.32" class="topiclink">B23.32</a>), even if that higher level has been Rubbled (<a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.3" class="topiclink">B24.3</a>). That modifies your IFT DR to a 7—a PTC. That's enough to strip away their concealment. Surprise, Jerry. He rolls, and the squad is pinned to boot. Now the last squad, the one at Level 0. What happens to it? &quot;Our IFT DR is modified by +3 for stone building, and another +2 for the two floors above it. The Final IFT DR is 8. No effect.&quot; That's right.</p>
<p>Had we scored a CH on our TH roll, we wouldn't get the bonus of reversing the TEM from positive to negative for everyone. We would use Random Selection to pick who got the CH thrashing (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.74" class="topiclink">C3.74</a>). And it's scary for people in stone buildings: the 16 column with a -3 on the IFT for the stone building. Everyone else in the hex would be hit on the IFT under the 4 column, as usual, figured with normal TEM bonuses added to our IFT DR. &quot;Uh, Drill Sergeant, would the guys on level 1 of the building get a -4? Er, -3 for the stone building, and another -1 for having a floor above them?&quot; No, the Brass says that the floor bonus does not apply to a CH, but good thinking.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> End of the PFPh, and let's look at the Germans' situation. They're in good cover, but our mortar has -2 Acquisition. Last turn we were lucky with our IFT DR. The HMG squad took a NMC, and the concealed squad took a PTC, lost its concealment, and ended up pinned. Our mortar is outside their range without a leader, and they can't even return fire. If you were the Germans, would you stay in that position? That, of course, depends on how the rest of the battle is going. But we've succeeded in making them think twice about what looked to be the strongest position on the board. And we're only one squad.</p>
<p>Now let's look at our situation. What do you think? &quot;I think we've got him against the ropes, Drill Sergeant!&quot; Yeah, yeah. And what else? &quot;Well, we are sitting out here in the middle of open terrain. What if the Germans come after us?&quot; Exactly. So far, we've looked at mortars as long-range fire support. That's ideal sometimes, but if you've ever waded through a couple of the ASL boards, you probably realize that long range shots are a luxury. Let's explore what happens if we're in a little closer to the action. First dm the mortar, and let's march over to 24O8. I've got some new tactics to show you.</p>
<p><img src="hs.gif" width="60" height="58" alt="HS" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Fall in! Okay, let's get that mortar reassembled. We're going to once again put a simulated German squad armed with a HMG in level 2 of building 24V3. We can't see him here, because of the hill to our east. I'm going to Deploy you boys into two HS (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.31" class="topiclink">A1.31</a>). Count off by two's, all ones will join our Assistant Squad Leader in HS Able, the rest of you will gather around the mortar in HS Baker. Now we'll wait out the turn until we gain Concealment for being out of LOS (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">A12.12</a>).</p>
<p>Next turn already? Somebody wake up McGrath. Okay, HS Baker still possesses the mortar and can stay here. HS Able, come with me. We are going to Assault Move up this hill, into the trees in 24P7. By using Assault movement into concealment terrain, we get to keep our &quot;?&quot; marker. Now look at our target in 24V3. That HMG suddenly looks a lot more dangerous, doesn't it? But we're still at Long Range for a German First Line squad, and we're concealed and in some cover. Not too tempting a target, we hope.</p>
<p>We are going to use our position here to act as Spotters for the mortar adjacent to us (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">C9.3</a>). From here, as long as we remain adjacent to the mortar, we can call down correcting fire information. Note that we merely need to be adjacent (within 1 hex) and not necessarily ADJACENT (within LOS and advance movement range). So we could be up a cliff or on the third level of a building or even out of LOS, for all the HS we're Spotting for cares. Because we're Spotting for them, they can fire the mortar and be immune from any return fire. And so long as you boys only call out correcting information, Spotting is not a Concealment Loss activity (Case C on the Concealment Loss/Gain table). And if we had been lucky enough to set up HIP, Spotting wouldn't give you away, either. A nice combination, don't you think? Now you boys stay here, and I'm going down to coach the mortar team. &quot;Uh, Drill Sergeant? Don't you think you'd better help us spot?&quot; Nah. Spotting is something I can't help you with (r), and if you do need to Rout away from that HMG, I'll be just one hex away, along your most logical Rout path. You stay put. I'm heading back to 24O8.</p>
<p>Howdy boys. Point that mortar where you think 24V3 is, and make sure you're aiming higher than HS Able. Okay, now that you Baker boys are firing the mortar, you lose any inherent FP. You'd also lose your &quot;?&quot; when you fire if any other Germans could see us, but we don't really care because the only ones we know about are out of our LOS. Another thing to know—your ROF will drop by one because you're losing some of your reloading speed using a Spotter and watching for correction signals from HS Able (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.31" class="topiclink">C9.31</a>). Now that we've declared HS Able to be our spotters, we can't use someone else as a spotter until HS Able is killed, captured, or broken. So if they are pinned, our Spotted Fire suffers from C5 Case D—Pinned Firer/Spotter. Let's wait for our DFPh and fire.</p>
<p>PHOOP!</p>
<p>And what do you need to hit? &quot;Range is 8 hexes, we have a base chance of 7. C5 Case Other says Spotted fire is a +2 DRM. C6 gives us no DRM, and we have no Acquisition from this new Location. We need a 5 TH.&quot; Close, but you missed one. The Brass says that while I can't help HS Able with its spotting, I can still use my Leadership DRM to help you guys fire your spotted mortar. So you'll need a 6 TH. What do you roll? &quot;A 7, colored die is a 2. We missed but have ROF.&quot; And we just gained our -1 for Target Acquisition, because HS Able is signaling us from above that our shot hooked a little.</p>
<p>We shoot again. What do we need to hit? &quot;A 7, counting DRM for Acquisition, leadership, and Spotted Fire.&quot; And do you hit? &quot;We roll a 4, colored die is 3. No ROF because it's reduced one for Spotted Fire.&quot; Good. Remember to flip the Acquisition counter to -2. Now roll for your effect. &quot;We roll 10 on the IFT, +3 for the stone building, and have no effect.&quot; Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><img src="resid4.gif" width="59" height="60" alt="RESID4" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, let's hold our fire a moment. HS Able is signaling that the Germans are finally bugging out of that building. This Spotted Fire might be a luxury we can't afford anymore. Let's get that mortar up with HS Able. No, don't dm it, just pick it up. Let me help. Take a quick check. It's a 5PP mortar, as a HS you can carry 3PP and I can help for one more. Together we have 5 MF. It'll cost 4 to get up the hill, so we can still Assault Move. Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p>HS Able, we're going to Recombine into our fun squad. By moving the mortar, we've lost any Acquisition we had on hex 24V3. Have you seen the Germans? &quot;No, Drill Sergeant, we lost them when they came down out of the building.&quot; Stay sharp, now it's their MPh, and we might get a shot. There! See them? They're moving in the trees over at 24V7! Far enough from us to be at Long Range for our FP, but we've got our mortar. Let 'em have it!</p>
<p>What do we need to hit? &quot;Range is 6 hexes, we have a base TH of 7. No more Spotted Fire, so C5 gives us +0. C6 gives us J3 FFNAM for -1, and Case R LOS Hindrance for the Orchard in 24U8 gives us +1, total +0 DRM. Your leadership modifier is another -1 DRM. We need an 8 to hit.&quot; Roll. &quot;We got a 6, colored die is a 2. We hit and got ROF.&quot; Place your Acquisition counter.</p>
<p>Now on the IFT we have a new special case. The Germans are in woods, and that gives this Indirect Fire an Air Burst (<a href="chb_chb13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">B13.3</a>) effect. The shrapnel of our shells is made even more vicious detonating on the tree tops and spreading down. Instead of the Germans getting a +1 TEM, they get a -1 for being in Woods. This modifier is cumulative with any other terrain, so even if they were in a foxhole, their TEM of +2 would also get a -1 for the Woods, for a net TEM of +1. But these boys are just standing there, thinking trees are good cover. What are your results? &quot;We roll a 7, TEM of -1 gives us a 6, which scores a NMC.&quot; Excellent. The Germans roll and break. They spent 2 MF in our LOS, so as long as we have ROF we can fire once more. Next shot.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a base 7, C5 gives us +0, C6 gives us -1 for Acquisition, +1 for LOS Hindrance, -1 for FFNAM, Leadership DRM -1, for a total DRM of -2. We need a 9 to hit. We roll a 10, and miss.&quot; That's all right. &nbsp;At least we've got that squad on the run. Two more things to know about an Airburst. First, any residual fire left in a woods hex by a mortar is increased by one IFT column. Second, a CH in woods still gets the -1 DRM to the EFT DR (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">C3.71</a>) for Airbursts—it isn't reversed to a positive value. The Brass says the +1 Direct Fire woods TEM is not considered for an Indirect Fire CH, but other TEM (e.g., entrenchment) would be. So, a CH against a foxhole in a woods hex would use -2 TEM for the foxhole, plus -1 TEM for the Airburst, for a total -3 DRM.</p>
<p>With our mortar's ROF exhausted, we could now sacrifice our Acquisition and use our inherent FP before the Germans rout away. And now that the heat of the moment is passed, I realize that we could have attacked the Germans with our inherent FP before we fired the mortar, and that way we wouldn't have interfered with our Acquisition. &quot;Unless we didn't have you with us, and we Cowered, right Drill Sergeant?&quot; Exactly, although I couldn't direct both your inherent FP and your mortar attack. I can't do everything, you know. When we're up against real German squads, I hope we'll keep our heads and not let them get off so easy.</p>
<p>Now we'll check out where the Germans went. Let's wait until our turn, and then move over to those woods in hex 24W5.</p>
<p><img src="walladvan.gif" width="57" height="58" alt="WALLADVAN" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Look around. I see another simulated German squad in hex 24BB4, behind that hedge. What do we need to hit? &quot;Range is 5 hexes, we have a base of 7. C5 is +0, C6 is +0, Leadership Modifier is -1. We need an 8.&quot; And roll. &quot;We roll a 7, colored die is 4. Hit with no ROF.&quot; Right.</p>
<p>Now hedges and walls don't offer the same protection against Indirect Fire as they do against Direct Fire. Their protective TEM is reduced by one (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.34" class="topiclink">B9.34</a>). This decreased protection also applies to Bocage. So the hedge that the Germans are hiding behind is a +0 TEM. This still would negate any chance at FFMO, because our LOS to the Germans crosses the hedge depiction. What do you do to the German? &quot;We roll an 8 on the IFT, +0 TEM for the hedge vs Indirect fire, for a result of No Effect.&quot; Close, though.</p>
<p>Any target hex that has a hedge or wall depiction gets the reduced TEM—even if our LOS didn't cross the depiction. &quot;Excuse me, Drill Sergeant? What?&quot; Look at hex 24AA10. Say there was a German squad in there, and we were set up in 24CC10. What TEM would he get? &quot;Wall TEM is +2, reduced to +1 vs Indirect Fire, Drill Sergeant.&quot; Right. Now, leave the German squad there, and let's say we're set up in hex 24Y10. He still gets a +1 TEM for the wall (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.34" class="topiclink">B9.34</a>). Not all of our Indirect Fire shots land exactly where we'd like them to land, and he still gets a little protection for being near the wall—even if he's on our side of it. &quot;But Drill Sergeant, if we saw him move there, would we still get a -1 FFMO DRM to our To Hit DR?&quot; Sure, that hasn't changed. So long as our LOS doesn't cross the depiction on the hexside, we see him as if he's in the open. He just gets a little TEM when we resolve our Indirect Fire. &quot;Drill Sergeant, would he get a modifier for two walls? He's adjacent to two hexsides that are wall depictions.&quot; Repetti, do you have any lawyers in your family? Well, nice try, but no. The rules say that you can only apply one wall TEM in this way.</p>
<p><img src="wp+2.gif" width="69" height="72" alt="WP+2" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Let's stop shooting at our simulated squad over there, and take a moment to look in some of our specially marked ammo boxes. This is our standard issue of Special Ammunition (<a href="chc_chc8.htm" class="topiclink">C8</a>). As I told you before, in addition to HE rounds, the M2 mortar can fire IR (<a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.7" class="topiclink">C8.7</a>, <a href="che_che1.htm#1.93" class="topiclink">E1.93</a>). Plus, depending on the date, sometimes it can also fire White Phosphorous (WP) (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.3" class="topiclink">A24.3</a>, <a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.6" class="topiclink">C8.6</a>).</p>
<p>IR are only useful for night scenarios, and I'm not going to teach you about fighting at night just yet. But some rules apply only to mortars firing IR, and we'll mention those. First, you must make a Usage dr of 4 or less before you actually can fire IR. Then to fire IR, you must make a TH roll. Not that you're going to hit anything, but you might malfunction your weapon or draw Sniper fire. Firing IR consumes all your ROF for that turn, and counts as a Gunflash. Placement of the IR...well, that starts getting into night specific rules, and I think I'll just encourage you boys to read <a href="che_che1.htm#1.932" class="topiclink">E1.932</a> and <a href="che_che1.htm#1.922" class="topiclink">E1.922</a> before you find yourselves manning a mortar some dark night.</p>
<p>Your WP Special Ammunition is another issue. Let's explore this ammo round carefully. First, note that the Index defines SMOKE as both Smoke and WP. WP is the U.S. player's version of SMOKE for this mortar. &quot;Drill Sergeant, why would we want to waste time firing SMOKE when we could be blasting the enemy with HE?&quot; Because a well placed SMOKE round can provide a Hindrance for your opponent's LOS to a hex you're concerned about crossing. SMOKE negates FFMO if your troops are moving behind it. We can even use WP offensively.</p>
<p>In any scenario set in 1945 (or December 1944 in any of the Kampfgruppe Peiper scenarios [KGP SSR 16]), the M2 mortar has a WP Depletion Number (<a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.9" class="topiclink">C8.9</a>) of 7. If you want to fire WP, announce that you're firing it, and roll TH. You compare your TH roll with the Depletion Number on the back of your mortar counter. If your roll is less than the number, you fired successfully. If you roll higher than the Depletion Number, you don't have any WP to fire and are considered to have not even fired yet— unless you malfunction the mortar. If you roll exactly your Depletion Number, you get off your last round of WP and can no longer try to fire it from this mortar—at least in this scenario. This requires your commander to do some record keeping to track who's still able to fire WP (Ammo depletion counters are available in Doomed Battalions). You can't fire SMOKE in fog, rain, heavy winds, Mud, or Deep Snow.</p>
<p>&quot;Drill Sergeant, what happens if you miss with a SMOKE round? Where does it go?&quot; Notice on C4 you get a +2 to your TH number if you're firing SMOKE within 12 hexes. It's pretty tough to miss when firing SMOKE. You'll probably roll higher than your Depletion Number before you ever miss with a SMOKE round. But just in case you find a way to miss, it's assumed to have landed where it is ineffective, and therefore not put into play. Maybe into somebody's rain barrel.</p>
<p>SMOKE must be fired before anything else fires in the PFPh and DFPh. As soon as you fire any other type of ammo during your PFPh/DFPh, you can't fire any more SMOKE. In addition, WP can be fired at the start of a friendly fire phase before any other fire. Of course this doesn't include a squad using Smoke Grenades (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.1" class="topiclink">A24.1</a>) since that happens during the MPh.</p>
<p>A couple of interesting things to notice about SMOKE. Firing from a mortar is the only way a commander can hope for multiple SMOKE clouds from one weapon, since using the Area Target Type consumes a non-mortar's ROF (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">C3.33</a>). If you maintain your ROF without depleting your Special Ammo, you can keep firing SMOKE. Smoke has to be fired in the PFPh or DFPh, but WP can be fired during any friendly fire phase. If it's other than the beginning of the PFPh, however, the WP is placed onboard as a white dispersed WP counter (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.31" class="topiclink">A24.31</a>). If you keep up your ROF, you can also switch from WP to HE rounds. Just remember that the first HE round fired ends any opportunity to fire more SMOKE this phase.</p>
<p>When WP hits, you place a WP counter on that hex; it's a +2 Hindrance cloud that rises 4 levels above the hex's ground Level. SMOKE always lands on the ground level of a hex, no matter who you were shooting at in that hex—even if the ground level is out of your LOS. Note that there are three different WP counters: a white WP counter with a +2 Hindrance, a white Dispersed WP counter with a +1 Hindrance, and a gray Dispersed WP counter with a +1 Hindrance. You place a white WP counter in your target hex after you score a hit. On your next PFPh, you flip the White WP counter over to the Dispersed WP side or remove it if already Dispersed. If there's a Mild Breeze blowing, the Brass says your WP remains a Level 4 Hindrance and during the AFPh it Drifts (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.61" class="topiclink">A24.61</a>), creating a row of two (or only one from a white dispersed WP counter) gray Dispersed WP counters that flow downwind from your original White WP counter.</p>
<p>If you're standing in a Location that's been hit with SMOKE, your view of the world is affected more than the world's view of you, and your IFT DR and TH modifiers add +1 (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.8" class="topiclink">A24.8</a>). And that's only one reason to think about shooting your opponent with WP. WP is also a major irritant. Anybody in a hex hit by WP (but never a hex into which WP has Drifted) must take a NMC (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.31" class="topiclink">A24.31</a>) unless safe inside a BU CT AFV. Leadership benefits and TEM—even Air Bursts—apply to this NMC, so chances of a result may be small. But a NMC will strip any concealment that the target had, which can be useful. This NMC will also DM an already broken target. Plus, you can score a CH with WP like any Area Target Type shots (or if you're throwing WP grenades and the affected unit rolls a 6 on the colored die during his NMC). Like a regular CH, a WP CH changes any positive DRM to a negative modifier to the NMC. WP is so volatile that it may cause fires in Dry or Very Dry EC (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.32" class="topiclink">A24.32</a>).</p>
<p><img src="blitz.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="Blitz" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, heads up. Hear that? &quot;Sounds like trucks coming, Drill Sergeant. From the east.&quot; Yeah, we're going to try firing our mortar at some vehicles. Because vehicles are so mobile, it can be hard to keep them Acquired since Area Acquisition doesn't track targets into new hexes. Unless, of course, the vehicle starts doing some cross-country driving and spends some quality time in each hex. During our opponent's MPh, we can only fire at a unit as many times in one Location as it spent MF/MP in that Location (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.17" class="topiclink">C6.17</a>).</p>
<p>Here comes our target. There's something coming around those woods, we'll likely see it in 24BB7. Yep, it's an Opel Blitz truck, with its Vehicle Covered Arc (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.11" class="topiclink">D3.11</a>) pointing due west. It just spent ½ a MP pulling into view. What do you need TH? &quot;Range is 5 hexes, we have a base 7 to hit. C5 gives us +0.&quot;</p>
<p>C6 gives us some new cases:</p>
<p>Case J: vs Moving Vehicle +2.</p>
<p>Case J2: Defensive First Fire vs Moving Vehicle ≤ 1 MP in our LOS +2.</p>
<p>Case P: Target Size +0.</p>
<p>Total:+4</p>
<p>Ouch. Throw in my Leader Modifier for -1, and what do you need to hit? &quot;7, C5 +0, C6 +4, Leader DRM -1, we need a 4 or less.&quot; And roll. &quot;We roll an 8, colored die is 3. Missed, but maintain ROF.&quot; Okay. And we can't shoot at the truck during its MPh until it either enters another Location or spends another MP (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.1" class="topiclink">A8.1</a>).</p>
<p>The Opel Blitz opts to keep moving into hex 24AA7. We can either fire at the truck or keep our -1 Acquisition on hex 24BB7. &quot;Are we going to get more targets coming down this road, Drill Sergeant?&quot; That's not the point—we're here to shoot this truck. What do you need TH? &quot;Range is 4 hexes, base 7 TH. C5 gives us +0.&quot; And for C6, Case J still applies (+2). Even though the truck has entered a new Location, it's still only spent 1 MP in our LOS, so J2 still applies (+2). Total is +4. &quot;Base 7, C5 +0, C6 +4, Leader DRM -1, we need a 4 TH.&quot; And your roll? &quot;Seven, colored die is 3. Missed and kept ROF again.&quot; All right. In the real world, we might have considered letting our mortar sit this one out and just shot that truck with our inherent FP. But we're here to learn about mortars, so keep dropping shells in the tube.</p>
<p>The Opel Blitz spends ½ a MP, and moves into 24Z6. We've seen it spend 1½ MP. Case J still applies, but now instead of P we get to use J1 (+1) since the truck has been moving in our LOS for more than 1 MP and less than or equal to 3 MP. So we now need a 5 TH. Roll. &quot;8 again, colored die is 2. Missed, but maintain ROF.&quot; Right now, if the truck moved into 24Y6 it would be closer than the minimum range of our mortar and we couldn't fire at it anymore. Fortunately, its driver's in training too, and it stays on the road.</p>
<p>That Opel Blitz now spends another 1 MP in hex 24Z6 to change VCA to the Y6-Z5 hexspine. It's spent 2½ MP in our LOS. What do you need to hit? &quot;Base 7, C5 is +0, C6 has Case J (+2), J1 still applies (+1), and Case N gives us -1 for Acquisition. Total is +2. Leader modifier is -1. We need a 6 to hit.&quot; Excellent. Fire away. &quot;We roll a 5, colored die is a 1, maintain ROF.&quot; Very good.</p>
<p>Unarmored vehicles are hit on the ★ row of the IFT (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.308" class="topiclink">A7.308</a>, <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.55" class="topiclink">C1.55</a>), and our DR would be modified by any applicable TEM. Our 60mm mortar gives us the 8FP column, halved for area fire is the 4FP column. The ★ row says &quot;5&quot;. If we roll less than 5 we destroy the truck and flip it to its Wrecked side, and any PRC onboard could roll for Survival (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>). If we roll half what we need to hit (FRD, so if we roll a 2), the truck becomes a Burning Wreck and nobody survives. If we roll exactly a 5, then the truck is Immobilized. Greater than a 5, and we have no effect on the truck. If, and only if, we don't destroy the truck, then any PRC onboard would suffer a General Collateral Attack. In this case, they would use the original IFT DR number we came up with on the 4FP column.</p>
<p>What do you roll? &quot;We roll a 9. No effect.&quot; And no effect on any vulnerable PRC, either. It's okay, we still have ROF.</p>
<p><img src="wreck.gif" width="71" height="71" alt="wreck" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" />The Opel Blitz spends ½ MP and moves to hex 24Z5. Total MP spent in our LOS is 3. Your chance To Hit? &quot;Base 7, C5 is +0, C6 Case J is +2, Case J1 is +1, Leader Modifier is -1. We need a 5 to hit.&quot; And do you? &quot;We roll a 5, colored die is 4. Hit with no more ROF.&quot; And to kill? &quot;We roll a 4!&quot; All right. The truck is flipped to its Wreck side, any passengers have to roll a Passenger/Rider Survival (cs) (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>) DR of 6 or less to escape the carnage. Seeing how we've already figured the damage on the vehicle, surviving passengers would not be further affected by a General Collateral Attack (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>) since the attack eliminated the truck. Nice shooting, boys. That was something like five shots in a row. Had the truck kept moving, it would have spent more than 3 MP in our LOS, and we finally would have lost that J1 modifier to our TH DR. And if you wanted to, you could now blast away with your inherent FP at any PRC that survived the hit.</p>
<p><img src="pz2a.gif" width="70" height="71" alt="Pz2A" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Next turn, now let's see what comes around the bend. Something is driving this way. And there's our target—a tank driving along the road, due east, and now entering 24BB7, Buttoned Up (BU) (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.2" class="topiclink">D5.2</a>) with its Vehicle Covered Arc (VCA) (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.11" class="topiclink">D3.11</a>) pointing at the AA7-AA8 hexspine. So far, we've seen it spend 1 MP in our LOS, so Case J2 would apply.</p>
<p>First, let's take a quick gander at the tank. It's a German Mark II. It's driving BU, so it'll be spending a full MP per hex it enters. That means we will lose our Case J1 and J2 modifiers much sooner than we did with the truck. Note that the white dot on the vehicle's Front Armor Factor means the vehicle is a Small Target (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.74" class="topiclink">D1.74</a>), and that its front and side armor are both 1.</p>
<p>The tank spends 1 MP and enters 24AA7. It's already spent two MP in our LOS, so Case J2 no longer applies. Fire when ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Range is 4 hexes, base TH is 7. C5 gives us +0. C6 gives us Case J for a Moving Vehicle (+2), Case J1 for it spending less than or equal to 3 MP in our LOS (+1). Case P Target Size is Small (+1), for a total of +4. Leader Modifier is -1. We need a 4 to hit.&quot; And roll. &quot;We get a 7, colored die is 3. Missed, but retain ROF.&quot; Okay.</p>
<p>The tank spends 1 MP to change its CA to the Z6-AA6 hexspine, so now it's spent 3 MP in our LOS. We can fire again. &quot;Base TH is 7. C5 is still 0. C6 gives us Case J (+2), Case J1 (+1), Case N Acquired Target (-1), and Case P (+1), for a total of +3. Leader Modifier is -1. We need 5 to hit.&quot; And? &quot;We roll a 6, colored die is 5. Miss with no ROF.&quot; We're done for this DFPh. We just gotta watch it drive now. The tank moves on to 24Z6, so it's spent more than 3 MP in our LOS. It spends another MP to change CA to hexspine Z5-AA6, spends 2 MP to move into hex 24Z5 with the wreck of the truck, and a MP to Stop.</p>
<p>During our Prep Fire Phase, we can shoot at the tank again. And this time, it isn't moving. What do you need? &quot;Range of 3 hexes is a base of 7, C5 is 0, C6 is only Case P (+1), and +1 modifier for the Hindrance of the wreck.&quot; No. A wreck is only a Hindrance if LOS goes through the hex, not just into or out of the hex (<a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">D9.4</a>). And Wreck TEM only applies to Infantry (<a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">D9.3</a>). Go on. &quot;So C6 is a total of +1. Leader Modifier is -1. So we need a 7 TH.&quot;</p>
<p>And your roll? &quot;We roll a 9, colored die is 3, we miss and maintain ROF.&quot; Keep shooting. &quot;Next shot gets an additional -1 for Acquisition, so we need an 8 to hit. We roll a 7, colored die is 5. We hit with no ROF.&quot; Outstanding. But now that we're shooting at an AFV, we have something new to check. The colored die not only tells us ROF, but also tells us the Hit Location against a Vehicle.</p>
<p>Hit location on an AFV is figured by what you rolled on your TH DR. If the white die is greater than the colored die on your DR, you've hit the turret. Otherwise you hit the hull (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.9" class="topiclink">C3.9</a>). You can remember this because it's the same color scheme as the suggested House Rule for Random Selection (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">A.9</a>) where the highest die declares which target is hit. The rules suggest the lightest hue (our white die) hits the top unit (the turret), and darker hue hits the lower unit in a stack (the hull). There's an exception for Location of a Hit if you get a CH vs a HD target, but nobody is ever HD against Indirect Fire (<a href="chd_chd4.htm#4.2" class="topiclink">D4.2</a>). So remember—roll the dice, check ROF, check Hit Location.</p>
<p>Note that our colored die was greater than or equal to the white die. That means we scored a hull hit. Remember to check now, before you rattle your dice around and forget. Next, we gotta roll on the IFT to see what damage we do to that tank (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.55" class="topiclink">C1.55</a>). The possibilities are:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;a KIA destroys the vehicle and allows for Crew Survival (CS) (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>, <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.9" class="topiclink">D6.9</a>);</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;a Final DR half or less of what is needed for a K/# results in a burning wreck (<a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.14" class="topiclink">B25.14</a>) and no CS (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>); and</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;either a K/# or 1 greater than a K/# result is an automatic Shock or Immobilization, depending on whether we hit, respectively, the turret or hull(<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.9" class="topiclink">C3.9</a>).</p>
<p>As usual, TEM (but not Airbursts vs BU CT AFV) modify our DR on the IFT. Seeing how we're firing Indirect Fire, the tank can't ever claim HD or HA against us. But if the tank was behind a wall, it would get the reduced TEM (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.52" class="topiclink">C1.52</a>) instead of HD status. Also, we get the following DRM for its armor (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.55" class="topiclink">C1.55</a>):</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If all AF are ≤ 4 we get -1 on the IFT.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If the vehicle is OT we get a -1.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If all AF are ≥ 8 we get a +1 (and we better say our prayers).</p>
<p>&quot;What happens if we either Shock or Immobilize the tank, Drill Sergeant?&quot; Immobilization (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.1" class="topiclink">D8.1</a>) means the crew must pass a TC to avoid abandoning the vehicle (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">D5.5</a>) and the tank can't change Locations anymore. Shock (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.4" class="topiclink">C7.4</a>) means the tank is out of commission for the rest of the Player Turn, with a 2/3 chance of being out of commission for the next Player Turn, and, if so, 50/50 odds of being eliminated altogether, with no chance of Crew Survival, come the Player Turn after that.</p>
<p>In summary, we can roll really low and make the tank a burning wreck, or roll moderately low and turn the tank to a wreck. Or we might Shock or Immobilize the tank. Or have no effect. So, What sort of modifiers do we have to our DR? &quot;We get -1 for the tank having all AF ≤ 4, and no TEM since it is in the open.&quot; Right. And what do you roll? &quot;A nine, modified to an 8. No effect.&quot; Well, a mortar shooting at a tank is often a crap shoot. Against this light tank, we needed to roll a 4 or less for any effect.</p>
<p><img src="ce.gif" width="61" height="58" alt="CE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, it's the tank's turn again. It looks like it's going Crew Exposed (CE) (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">D5.3</a>) for some reason—either it wants to take advantage of the Road Movement Rate, or its commander is a little reckless! And it's spending a MP to Start (<a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.12" class="topiclink">D2.12</a>). Let's do that tank the courtesy of firing at it before it scoots out of our sight.</p>
<p>What do we need? &quot;Range is 3 hexes, base TH is 7. C5 is +0. C6 gives us Case J (+2), Case N (-2), and Case P (+1), for a total DRM of +1. Leader Modifier is -1. We need a 7 TH.&quot; Er, not quite. A vehicle that just Started is not a Moving Target according to the fine print in <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.12" class="topiclink">D2.12</a> and <a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.8" class="topiclink">C.8</a> so Case J doesn't apply until the tank moves into a new hex. You need a 9 TH. Roll. &quot;We get a 6, colored die is 1, so we hit the tank and maintain ROF.&quot; Good.</p>
<p>And guess what? We have a new case to look at. This time, we're hitting the tank with its Crew Exposed. This means we can roll to damage the tank and damage the tank commander and any hypothetical passengers or riders. Just as if there were personnel in the same hex as the tank, we resolve this as a General Collateral Attack (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.14" class="topiclink">A.14B</a>) because we are firing at the hex with Area Target Type, except that you only affect PRC if you hit the tank. We roll the dice once on the IFT, look at the results vs the tank, then use the same DR to resolve an attack against the exposed crew. The crew receives a +2 modifier for cover from the tank, called a CE DRM (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.31" class="topiclink">D5.31</a>). This is instead of the hex's TEM, except you would count Air Bursts.</p>
<p>In addition to figuring the wreck/Shock/Immobilized effects on a tank, we also check the effects on the crew. If the crew fails a MC, the tank is Stunned (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.34" class="topiclink">D5.34</a>). This forces the tank to BU and Stop, and not fire for the remainder of that turn. The crew is also cursed with a +1 Stun counter for the rest of the scenario, which affects any vehicle crew's TH, MC, TC, IFT, CC, and Overrun DR. Bad day for the treadheads.</p>
<p>If the crew suffers a KIA or Casualty Reduction, the tank is Recalled with a +1 STUN counter (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">D5.341</a>), and must BU and Stop like before. When it starts again, it must try to exit the map off a Friendly Board Edge as quickly as possible by spending the least amount of MP it can. It could stop only long enough to unload passengers. &quot;But Drill Sergeant, wouldn't the KIA result also wipe out the tank?&quot; Usually Dunn, but not always. Remember the crew checks with the +2 CE DRM instead of whatever TEM the tank had—a heavily armored tank in rubble would get a +4 DRM while the crew gets only a +2.</p>
<p>So what do you roll for results after that hull hit we scored? &quot;On the 4 FP column, we roll a 3!&quot; Great! But don't forget your -1 for the tank having all AF less than or equal to 4, so your modified DR is a 2. First the tank—that's an automatic Immobilization for it. The Collateral Damage rule (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.14" class="topiclink">A.14</a>) says we affect the crew subsequent to all results of the attack against the vehicle. So next the crew takes an immediate Immobilization TC (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">D5.5</a>) to see whether it bails out. The Germans pass, so they stay in the tank. Now we check for the Collateral Damage on the exposed crew. A DR of 3, +2 for CE DRM, is a 5, or 1MC. The Germans roll a 9, or &quot;nein!&quot; in this case, and fail their morale check. They are Stunned.</p>
<p>You still have ROF. &quot;Still need a 9 TH, and we roll a 10. No ROF.&quot; That's okay, we know the tank isn't doing anything for at least a Player Turn or so.</p>
<p>Well, we've seen how to shoot a lightly armored tank. What would be different if it had been a King Tiger? &quot;Instead of the -1 DRM for all armor being less than or equal to 4, we would have had a +1 because all armor would have been greater than or equal to 8.&quot; &quot;But the tank would have been easier to hit in the first place, because it is a Very Large target.&quot; Okay, so we would hit it because it's hard to miss. But before we needed to roll a 4 or less on the IFT to even affect the light tank, and against this monster we'd need a 2. And we could try for a Collateral Attack if it was driving around CE. Not great odds, but a light mortar still has the option if you're desperate.</p>
<p><img src="spw251-1.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="SPW251-1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> I want to take a moment here to talk about Open Topped (OT) AFV. For the most part we treat them exactly like any other AFV, except for the -1 modifier for IFT damage that the chart in <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.55" class="topiclink">C1.55</a> gives us. But if we were fortunate enough to catch an OT AFV in the woods, where it would suffer Air Bursts (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.311" class="topiclink">D5.311</a>), its crew would be Vulnerable and get no protection from the vehicle, not even the CE DRM and not even if BU. The crew would take a hit just like Infantry, and would suffer any results from KIA down to PTC. And if they failed a morale check, they'd rout from the vehicle, just like us foot soldiers. Furthermore, such an AFV is treated as unarmored vs our mortar, with our attack against it, but not its crew, treated as if the AFV were a truck—but with no Air Burst TEM.</p>
<p><img src="pak+crew.gif" width="128" height="70" alt="Pak+crew" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> There's one more target type I'd like to mention—Guns. Barring unusual circumstances, a Gun, including a mortar on a ⅝&quot; counter, that is still where it originally set up at the beginning of a scenario is Emplaced (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">C11.2</a>) with a +2 TEM. Even if a Gun loses its emplacement because it is moved during a scenario, it may still provide some protection for the crew. AT and INF Guns are built with Gunshields (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">C11.5</a>), which normally offer their crew a +2 DRM through their covered arc. Against Indirect Fire, though, a Gunshield offers only a +1 DRM. Mix that with Airbursts, and a Gun might suddenly regret setting up in Woods.</p>
<p>All mortars can be destroyed like any other SW—either deliberately during any PFPh/DFPh (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.73" class="topiclink">A9.73</a>), or by IFT (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.74" class="topiclink">A9.74</a>), OVR (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.74" class="topiclink">A9.74</a>), and CC (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.13" class="topiclink">A11.13</a>) results. A mortar on a ⅝&quot; counter, like all Guns, is automatically destroyed and its crew eliminated by any CH (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">C3.71</a>).</p>
<p>And one last thing. Before you ran off and start using Captured mortars from the enemy, there are two things to remember. First, your X#/B# is decreased by two and the original B# is now an X# (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.11" class="topiclink">A.11</a>). Second, you reduce your ROF by one (<a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.12" class="topiclink">A21.12</a>), and add +2 to your TH DR (Case H). These same penalties apply if I ever catch you dogfaces trying to use a ⅝&quot; mortar that should be manned by a trained Crew. And if you have the audacity to try to use a Captured ⅝&quot; mortar, you suffer both the penalties. I don't want to stand around you when you're trying that.</p>
<p><img src="747+8-1.gif" width="126" height="62" alt="747+8-1" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Well, boys, that's your indoctrination on light mortars and basic Ordnance principles. This lesson doesn't cover every last rule, though. Terrain often has special cases for Indirect Fire, Ordnance, or mortars, and I recommend you look up anything you're unsure of. We've also broached a lot of the rules that are the backbone to understanding Ordnance in Chapter C. There are some more rules you need to master before trying out some of the larger mortars on ⅝&quot; counters. But those rules apply to all other Guns, too, so only those of you that go on to Advanced Ordnance Training need to concern yourselves with that knowledge. If you master the situations we've talked about here, you'll open up a whole new collection of scenarios that you can participate in.</p>
