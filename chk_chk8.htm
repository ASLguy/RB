Gentlemen, you have been chosen exclusively from the ranks of the Infantry to receive special training to become a crew. You should consider this a great honor. Infantry crews are always considered Elite (<a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.123" class="topiclink">A1.123</a>), and are expected at all times to act that way. The front of your counter shows you have a FP of 2 up to a range of 2, but your training will hopefully keep you from ever actually needing this. You have the same Morale Level as an Elite unit from the Infantry. If you look at the back of your counter, the box around your ML means you also have the ability to Self-Rally (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.63" class="topiclink">A10.63</a>). You guys will work together as a team, and I am here today to train you in the proper use of crew-served weapons.</p>
<p>Notice that your crew counter has two men depicted on it. This means you take up as much room in a Location or in a track as a half-squad. Being a crew, you can operate any friendly crew-served weapons with no penalty for Non-Qualified Usage (<a href="cha_cha21.htm#21.13" class="topiclink">A21.13</a>)—unlike just any yokel Infantry squad that tries to operate a cannon.</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself, I'm First Lieutenant Huntington. Although I'll be instructing you on the ins and outs of ordnance, neither I nor any other leader can apply a leadership DRM to help you or any other crew fire a Gun. The only ordnance a leader can influence is SW ordnance (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.531" class="topiclink">A7.531</a>)—and even those have exceptions. After this training, if any of you think you can't handle a Gun on your own, without me spoon feeding coordinates to you, let me know now and I'll submit your paperwork for re-admission to the Infantry. Anyone? Good.</p>
<p>Before we get into your lesson, it is important for you to know two definitions. First, can anyone tell me what &quot;ordnance&quot; is? Anyone? &quot;Sir! Ordnance is any weapon that requires a To Hit DR, Sir!&quot; (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.2" class="topiclink">C.2</a>) Exactly right. This includes all sorts of weapons—mortars, bazookas, artillery, and even machine guns when they are shooting at an AFV. Now that you know ordnance has to roll to hit, can anyone tell me what a &quot;Gun&quot; is? &quot;Sir! A Gun is any non-vehicular weapon depicted on a ⅝&quot; counter (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.1" class="topiclink">C2.1</a>), Sir!&quot; We're all Elite here, Goetz, you don't have to show off. Remember that a vehicle's non-MG MA is also a Gun, although not one you clowns will be operating.</p>
<p>Being a crew, you need to realize that you're not Like everybody else in the Infantry. A crew is immune to ELR Reduction (<a href="cha_cha19.htm#19.1" class="topiclink">A19.1</a>), and is immune to Heat of Battle results (<a href="cha_cha15.htm#15.1" class="topiclink">A15.1</a>). When you are firing ordnance, you are also immune to Cowering (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.9" class="topiclink">A7.9</a>). I never want to see any of you thinking you're the next John Wayne and charging at the enemy. And don't ever slink away from your main mission of keeping your Gun fully manned. I expect each of you to know that your job is to crew your weapon, and I expect you to do it well. Meet me over in hex 4K4. Fall out!</p>
<p><img src="57l.gif" width="74" height="70" alt="57L" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT! Gentlemen, at ease. I'll bet some of you have not even had more than a passing glance at a ⅝&quot; weapon before. This, boys, is a Gun. Ordnance on a ⅝&quot; counter. This is a standard issue 57mm AT Gun, with which Uncle Sam expects you to knock out enemy tanks, tracks, horses, and Infantry. A lot of what you've previously learned from your Drill Sergeant about mortars will still apply when using a Gun.</p>
<p>Firing ordnance, whether a SW or a Gun, is a two step process. First you roll a To Hit (TH) DR (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.3" class="topiclink">C3.3</a>). If, after all DRM, the Final DR is less than or equal to your Modified TH#, you score a hit. Then you make another DR to see what the effects are. Checks for Special Ammunition are the same as they were for mortars, as are checks for ROF, malfunction, and repair, and many other rales you've already been taught. Unlike a SW mortar, an Infantry Leadership Modifier never applies to your TH chances (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.4" class="topiclink">D3.4</a>). Get to your posts on the Gun. Put your crew counter underneath the 57mm AT Gun counter to show that you're the crew here, just like you would do with a SW. When you are manning a Gun, you and it are equivalent to one squad for stacking purposes (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">A5.5</a>).</p>
<p>I want you all to be very familiar with how Guns work, and not just for the sake of firing field artillery. When you start looking at AFV, you'll see that the rales you learned for Guns are also what you need to fire the MA (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.3" class="topiclink">D1.3</a>) of a tank.</p>
<p>First, why is this on a ⅝&quot; counter? &quot;So you can put more useless information on it, Sir?&quot; Watch your mouth, Slotwinski. Well, there's lots of reasons. But first you need to show which way the Gun is pointing. When you fire a SW it's usually not important which way the counter is facing. For Guns, though, this is vital. These weapons are a little too big to whip around to a new target as quickly as you can with a SW. Most Gun counters point their muzzles to the lower right corner to show which direction the Gun is facing. Position your Gun so the lower-right corner points to hexspine L3-L4. This shows your Gun is pointing due east. This hexspine defines your Covered Arc (CA) <a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">(C3.2)</a>—a 60° field of fire that covers all territory between and including the L3-M3-N2-O2 hexgrain to the L4-M5-N5-O6 hexgrain, and as far out as your maximum range and LOS will allow. You can only shoot at a target that is in your CA. If you spin the Gun one hexspine counter-clockwise so its pointing at the K3-L3 hexspine, your new CA runs from the K1-K2-K3 hexrow to the L3-M3-N2-O2 hexgrain. Turn the Gun back to face east.</p>
<p>Normally, you could turn your Gun's CA to fire at a unit that appears on your flanks, but you can suffer some heavy TH DRM for turning to shoot. If you want to change your CA, but you don't have a target, you can turn at the end of a friendly fire phase if you still theoretically could shoot (not counting Intensive Fire, which we'll talk about later).</p>
<p>For example, say it's our DFPh, and even though you don't have anyone in your LOS to shoot at, you hear the battle coming your way. You could turn the cannon any number of hexspines to face this oncoming threat even though you didn't shoot. Another example. Say during your PFPh you shot at the only unit in your LOS, and absolutely pulverized it. If you maintained ROF, but didn't have any new targets to take a shot at, you could take this opportunity to change your CA.</p>
<p>Be sure to notice that the <a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.121" class="topiclink">A12.121</a> Concealment Loss/Gain Table says that changing CA is a concealment loss activity if any Good Order Enemy units are in LOS. So if you're setting up a Gun in some sneaky Location before a scenario begins, choose your CA carefully.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the counter itself. The upper right corner tells us this is an AT Gun, but don't feel you are restricted to firing at tanks. Under the AT, we see &quot;M10&quot; in a white dot. This M# represents the Manhandling Number (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.27" class="topiclink">C2.27</a>), which we'll discuss later. Suffice it to say this represents how easy it is to haul the Gun around, just like PP do for SW. Unlike PP, though, the bigger the M#, the lighter the load. The white dot on the right shows your Gun Target Size (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.271" class="topiclink">C2.271</a>). White means your cannon is a Small Target; a red M# would mean it's a Large Target, and neither red nor white means normal size. We have a ROF of 3, which works just like it did for SW. In the lower left corner, we see the Gun Caliber. Yours is a 57mm; underscored means you can't fire HE (but it's starred, so we'll check the back of the counter in a moment). The L means your Gun has a Long Barrel Length (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">C4.1</a>), giving you some bonuses for longer-ranged shots.</p>
<p>Flip the counter over. Here we see Repair and Breakdown numbers, just like a SW. In the lower left corner, we see this Gun is a Quick Set-Up (QSU) Gun (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.23" class="topiclink">C10.23</a>), which we'll look at more closely when we talk about moving the Gun around. And across the top, you see Special Ammo Depletion Numbers, which by themselves should remind you how important it is to read the Chapter H notes for anything you're taking out into the field.</p>
<p>Chapter H tells us that HE and APDS ammo are available as Special Ammunition for this Gun in Europe for 1944. APDS is a typical example of Special Ammo, but having HE as Special Ammo is somewhat unusual. Most Guns carry a lifetime supply of both AP and HE. To use Special Ammo, you have to make a TH DR less than or equal to whatever your Depletion Number is on the back of your ordnance counter. In your case, you have to roll 7 or less to give 'em some HE. If you roll more than your Depletion Number then you're out of HE ammo for this particular Gun for the rest of the scenario. If you roll exactly 7 (i.e., your Depletion Number), you get HE for this shot only. The good news is, if you roll over your Depletion Number, no shot occurred. It's as if you haven't even fired your weapon yet—unless you roll high enough to Malfunction your weapon.</p>
<p>So what other information should you know about this Gun? Not everything is printed on its counter. There's a handful of general rules that apply to most Guns most of the time:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless a Gun specifically lists its range, assume it can fire as far as you can see. If you really need to know a Gun's maximum range, it will be listed in the Ordnance Notes table. Our gun has a maximum effective range of 247 hexes (just under 10,000 meters, or almost eight board lengths).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If the counter doesn't say otherwise, assume it has a Breakdown number of 12 (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.28" class="topiclink">C2.28</a>), just like a SW.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Because this is an AT, it has a Gunshield (as do INF Guns (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">C11.5</a>)).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Most Guns can Intensive Fire (IF) (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">C5.6</a>), which means they can fire once more in a phase after their ROF is used up—with an increased chance of malfunctioning and an increased TH DRM. This is similar to Sustained Fire with a MG.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Non-Turreted (NT) Guns don't have a 360° mount of some kind and (except for mortars) have their ROF reduced by one on their next shot if they have to change their CA to fire at a target. This is called Conditional ROF (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.5" class="topiclink">C2.5</a>). A Gun with no ROF possibilities would be marked with an Intensive Fire counter, meaning it can't Intensive Fire.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You can't fire a Gun if it's been moved to a different hex this Player Turn, unless it's a Main Armament for a vehicle (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.8" class="topiclink">C2.8</a>), like the 75mm Gun on a Sherman. A crew could conceivably move and try to Recover an unpossessed Gun, and fire it during the AFPh (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.41" class="topiclink">A4.41</a>).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Guns can only fire once during the AFPh—no ROF and no IF allowed (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.2" class="topiclink">C5.2</a>), unless you declared you were using Opportunity Fire during the PFPh.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If we were the <a href="s.htm#scenarioattackerdefender" class="topiclink">Scenario Defenders</a> (as defined in the Index), you could choose a hex to Bore Sight (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">C6.4</a>).</p>
<p><img src="hmfile_hash_13ddbaef.gif" width="140" height="75" alt="concealed gun" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Before we try shooting at targets, let's first look at how you set a Gun up for a scenario. This is important. Not just because you might be getting shot at during your target practice, but because some of your targets are going to be other Guns.</p>
<p>First, where are Guns not allowed to set up (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.7" class="topiclink">C2.7</a>)? You can never put a Gun at any level of a building above the ground floor (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.423" class="topiclink">B23.423</a>)—unless that Location is Fortified (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.9" class="topiclink">B23.9</a>). You can never set up a Gun in a Water Obstacle—unless it's in some kind of vehicle or boat, and dismantled or limbered if applicable. Any Small or Normal sized AT or INF Gun, and any other Small-sized Gun can set up in a building or rubble. There are many exceptions to these general rules when mortars are involved. Even the big mortars on ⅝&quot; counters can set up in Crags (<a href="chb_chb17.htm#17.4" class="topiclink">B17.4</a>), Graveyards (<a href="chb_chb18.htm#18.43" class="topiclink">B18.43</a>), Entrenchments (<a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.1" class="topiclink">B27.1</a>), and rubble. But mortars cannot fire from inside a building (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.423" class="topiclink">B23.423</a>), although they can fire from a Rooftop Location of a building (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.85" class="topiclink">B23.85</a>) [EXC: roofless factory (<a href="cho_cho5.htm#5.45" class="topiclink">O5.45</a>)].</p>
<p>So where would you want to set up a Gun? A Gun that sets up on board can be Emplaced (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">C11.2</a>) as long as it's not on a paved road (or hooked up to a vehicle). An Emplaced Gun gets a +2 TEM which can never be combined with any other terrain TEM, unless you're hit by an Airburst in woods (<a href="chb_chb13.htm#13.3" class="topiclink">B13.3</a>) for an additional -1 TEM. Only Infantry actually manning a Gun can take advantage of the Emplacement TEM. The Brass Sez that only a Gun manned by a crew can set up Emplaced and that only a crew or HS can claim Emplacement TEM, never a full squad.</p>
<p>&quot;So what happens if we move the Gun, Sir?&quot; Well, you lose Emplacement when it's moved. And if your Gun is not already set up at the start of a scenario, then it can never be eligible for Emplacement. But in either case you can still find cover. You and your Gun can always claim the TEM for whatever terrain you set up in. Furthermore, INF and AT Guns, like ours here, usually have Gunshields (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">C11.5</a>). A Gunshield provides a +2 TEM to the crew if the incoming Infantry fire is through the CA of the Gun. Barring Airburst, you can never combine this +2 TEM with any other TEM—even the Emplacement bonus—and Indirect Fire reduces your Gunshield to just a +1 TEM.</p>
<p>One great thing about setting up a Gun: if you're Emplaced at the beginning of a scenario, then you and your Gun can set up HIP (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.34" class="topiclink">A12.34</a>). No need for a SSR, or Scenario Defender status, and no restriction on the number of units that qualify. It's your privilege simply for being a Gun and crew. You can even set up HIP in non-Concealment Terrain, but you would lose your HIP status and become merely concealed if a Good Order enemy unit within 16 hexes ever has LOS to your setup hex. Even regular old concealment is especially good for Emplaced Guns. If there's a Good Order enemy within 16 hexes that can see your Location, you still retain concealment when you roll TH provided the colored die is 4 or less; if your Good Order enemy is at least 17 hexes away, you retain concealment if the colored die 5 or less. When you fire a HIP Gun within LOS of an enemy unit, you place it onboard. If the colored die of the TH DR is low enough, you retain concealment and cover the Gun with a &quot;?&quot; marker. Be sure to remember, though, that changing your Gun's CA is a concealment loss and HIP loss activity, as is firing IFE (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.29" class="topiclink">C2.29</a>).</p>
<p>Knowing that you can be HIP at setup, where would you want to put your Gun at the beginning of a scenario? &quot;In Concealment Terrain, Sir.&quot; Yes, Emge, but some Concealment Terrain might be better than others. With all your trips through the To Hit tables when you were firing light mortars, you've never had to look at Case A very closely since the M2 mortar doesn't have a CA. This modifier applies if you are changing the CA of your Gun. Note that no matter how bad the TH modifiers are for changing your CA, they are doubled if you are in woods, a building, or rubble. So setting up in Concealment Terrain like brush, orchards, or grain is less restricting for a Gun than setting up in buildings or woods. And so long as you're going to rely on the +2 Emplaced TEM, you shouldn't care too much about the TEM of the Concealment Terrain where you set up. Of course, a stone building would boost your TEM to +3 (or +4 if Fortified), so you might have to consider setting up in such terrain despite the penalties for changing your Covered Arc. Enough about setup, I think you're about due for a little practice working through the To Hit tables.</p>
<p><img src="467.gif" width="60" height="59" alt="467" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Let's try shooting a couple of targets. Your Gun is in hex 4K4, with the barrel pointing at hex M4. So where is our CA? &quot;Hexgrain L3-M3-N2, hexgrain L4-M5-N5, and everything in between, Sir.&quot; Exactly.</p>
<p>First let's fire at a simulated German 4-6-7 squad in 4T3. You will fire HE using the Infantry Target Type, or ITT, (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.32" class="topiclink">C3.32</a>), not the Area Target Type (ATT) that mortars have to use. You could use ATT to fire HE at the 4-6-7, and if it were in a high TEM Location, it might even be easier to hit with ATT, but then the FP of any resulting hit would be halved, just like with mortars.</p>
<p>Remember that, unlike most Guns, the 57mm AT treats HE shots as Special Ammo, and it has a HE Depletion Number of 7. HE is the assumed ammo for most Guns firing against Infantry unless stated otherwise (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">C2.21</a>), but because HE is a Special Ammo for you, you must declare it. Let's try a shot.</p>
<p>First let's calculate what you need To Hit. A lot of this should be familiar to you from your mortar training. Tell me what you read from your TH tables. Private Dunn, start with <a href="tables_c3tohittable.htm" class="topiclink">C3</a>, and work your way on down. &quot;Well, we are at a range of 9 hexes, so our Basic TH# against Infantry is .. .umm.&quot; Hold on, you seem to be getting confused by the two TH numbers, the black numbers and red numbers. Some nationalities use black numbers, some use red. You can find which number to use on the National Capabilities Chart. Find the U.S. row and trace over to the &quot;ORDNANCE TH# Color&quot; column. Meier, since its August 1944, what TH# color will you use? &quot;Black, sir!&quot; Very good. Note that those poor slobs who invaded North Africa had to use the red numbers. OK, continue with the TH tables. &quot;Range of 9, black numbers, Basic TH# on the ITT is 7. None of the C4 modifiers apply to a L Gun at a range of 9 hexes.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the <a href="tables_c5firer-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C5 Firer-Based Hit Determination DRM Table</a>. Have you the firer done anything to complicate this shot?</p>
<p>Case A: Firer outside CA per hexspine changed—you're pointed the right way.</p>
<p>Case B: Fire in AFPh—not you, you're firing in your PFPh.</p>
<p>Case C through C4: Bounding Firer—this applies to vehicles or when using an LATW, not to you.</p>
<p>Case D: Pinned Firer—you boys better not be pinned yet.</p>
<p>Case E: Fire within hex—not a problem, your target's way over there.</p>
<p>Case F: Intensive Fire—not on your first shot.</p>
<p>Case G: Deliberate Immobilization—only an option if you were firing at a vehicle.</p>
<p>Case H: Captured/Non-Qualified-Infantry—you're a crew, so this makes you qualified. Only in theory, though. I'll believe you're actually qualified when I see you hit something.</p>
<p>Case I: Buttoned Up AFV—not you, you're Infantry.</p>
<p>Quickly glance through the Other category, and make sure none of these penalties like CX apply to you. How are you doing? &quot;None apply, Sir. We have zero DRM so far.&quot; Good.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the <a href="tables_c6target-basedthdrm.htm" class="topiclink">C6 Target-Based Hit Determination DRM table</a>.</p>
<p>Case J: Moving/Motion Vehicle or Dashing Infantry—well, they certainly don't look dashing from here.</p>
<p>Case J1 through J2: Defensive First Fire vs Moving Vehicle—no, this is an Infantry target.</p>
<p>Case J3 through J4: FFNAM/FFMO—no, they're just sitting there, waiting for your shot.</p>
<p>Case K: Concealed Target, also known as Area Fire (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">C.4</a>)—no, they've been spotted. Notice this is the only penalty that ordnance pays for shooting at concealed targets, instead of halving the FP like you do with Small Arms or machine gun fire.</p>
<p>Case L: Point Blank Range—that'd be within two hexes. You're not so lucky.</p>
<p>Case M: Bore Sighted Location—We aren't Scenario Defenders (as per the Index), so you didn't get a chance to Bore Sight (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">C6.4</a>).</p>
<p>Case N: Acquired Target—This is similar to what you learned with mortars. For this first shot, though, you have no Acquisition.</p>
<p>Case O: Target using Hazardous Movement—no, they're just sitting there.</p>
<p>Case P: Target Size Modifier—only Guns and vehicles have a Target Size (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">C6.7</a>). Men and the broad side of a barn don't.</p>
<p>Case Q: TEM—they catch us here. The Germans will get +2 for their wooden building.</p>
<p>Case R: LOS Hindrance—none.</p>
<p>And always check the &quot;Other&quot; DRM, although none apply just now.</p>
<p>So what do you need to hit, Dunn? &quot;Under C5, no modifiers apply to us. Under C6, the only applicable modifier is Case Q, the +2 TEM for their wooden building. So our modified TH# is 7, with a +2 DRM—we will hit on a 5 or less.&quot; Very good. What do you roll? &quot;We roll a 6, and miss. Our colored die is a 2, so we retain ROF.&quot; Also notice that your TH DR is less than 7, your Special Ammo Depletion Number, so you can keep firing HE ammo.</p>
<p><img src="acq-1large.gif" width="70" height="73" alt="ACQ-1large" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><img src="acq-1small.gif" width="57" height="58" alt="ACQ-1small" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Because you've taken a shot at those Krauts, they become an Acquired Target (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">C6.5</a>). You get to place a ½&quot; -1 Acquisition counter on them. If you don't lose your Acquisition, your next shot will get a -1 TH DRM for Case N.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Acquisition counters—smaller ones on ½&quot; counters and larger ones on ⅝&quot; counters. For an Infantry Target Type or a Vehicle Target Type, you mark your Acquisition with a ½&quot; counter. If you had declared Area Target Type, you would use a ⅝&quot; counter instead, to show that the hex is targeted instead of a particular unit or Location. If you're looking at units in the same Location that you previously Acquired, you can use Bracketing (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.52" class="topiclink">C6.52</a>) and switch between using Area Target Types (⅝&quot; Acquisition) to attack the hex, and Vehicle or Infantry Target Types (½&quot; Acquisition) to attack a unit in the hex, or vice versa. And so long as you're not trying to use a ½&quot; Acquisition against a concealed unit, you could use your Acquisition to attack any other unit that was in the same Location as your previously acquired target.</p>
<p>Your next shot will get to use the -1 TH DRM, and after that shot your Acquisition counter is flipped to the -2 side. A -2 DRM is as high as you can get with Acquisition.</p>
<p>While we're thinking about Acquisition, let's look at the ways it could go away. Here's how you might lose your Acquisition on the Germans:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You fire at another target (including using the Gun to Interdict a routing enemy).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You malfunction the Gun.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You move the Gun, or rotate its CA without firing at your Acquired target.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; The Germans move out of your LOS (in which case you keep Acquisition on their last in-LOS Location).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You fire SMOKE (that includes WP), canister, or IFE (you can't actually fire any of these with this particular Gun).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You are not in Good Order (that's broken, Berserk, or in Melee—so you can keep Acquisition if you are merely Pinned).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You lose Possession of the Gun (in which case you'll have to answer to Supply Corps).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You limber or unlimber the Gun (more about this later).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You fire your inherent FP of 2 (including using your FP to Interdict a routing enemy).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You attack in CC.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; The Germans die (then we'd still have Acquisition on their last known Location).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You die.</p>
<p>You've got ROF, so shoot again. &quot;We get our Acquisition, so this time we need a DR of 6 or less to hit. We roll, and get a 7. Colored die is 2, so we maintain ROF. Our Acquisition becomes -2.&quot; And you rolled a 7. That means you just fired off your last HE round for this scenario. Gentlemen, you just made the rest of my examples a little difficult to demonstrate. Blasted recruits. We're going to have to bend the rules a little bit here, and get a special shipment of HE—just so you have enough to finish your target practice. Call this a SSR, where your 57mm AT has an unlimited supply of HE.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, couldn't we fire at the building with AP? Just because we're out of HE, does that mean we can't hit them anymore?&quot; Firing AP is an option, but it's not too effective against Infantry. It'll take a few minutes for supply to run some more HE ammo out to us, so while we're waiting, let's see what would happen. Go ahead and shoot an AP round at them. &quot;We have -2 Acquisition, so we need a DR of 7 or less to hit. We roll, and get a 6, with the colored die equal to 3. We hit and maintain ROF.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, now that you've hit, let's see what you've done. Normally, if you'd fired a HE round, you would roll for an effect under the 6/50 column of the IFT. But because you're firing AP against Infantry, you check your Gun's HE Equivalency (<a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.31" class="topiclink">C8.31</a>), and find that AP ≥ 37mm has a HE Equivalency of 2. Hard to affect a whole squad when you're firing a slug two inches wide. Let's make your DR on the IFT to see how Jerry takes the shot. &quot;Sir, that would be 2 FP with a +2 DRM for the TEM.&quot; Nice try, Hadady, but we are using the ITT, not the ATT. You already accounted for the TEM in the TH process. Back when you were firing your mortar on the ATT you ignored the TEM for the TH roll and applied it to the effects. For the ITT and the Vehicle Target Type, the TEM applies to the TH roll, not to the effects (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.3" class="topiclink">C.3</a>). Continue. &quot;We roll a 7, no DRM apply, so we have no effect.&quot; Frustrating sometimes, isn't it? Even more insulting, if you fire AP at a target during their MPh, you don't even leave Residual FP. Let's not bother with continuing your ROF.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Now that you've seen how Acquisition works, there's something more for you to consider as you set up your Gun. Check to see if you're lucky enough to be the Scenario Defender—the Index says that means all of your opponents units enter from offboard and you don't have to capture any terrain that you don't already own to win the scenario. As a Scenario Defender, you can choose to Bore Sight (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">C6.4</a>) your Guns (as well as any AFV MA, and any MMG, HMG, or light mortar within its normal range).</p>
<p>Bore Sighting is sort of like a pre-Acquired hex, and gives you the Case M -2 DRM from the TH table. Before a scenario begins, record a Location within your LOS and within 16 hexes as your Bore Sighted Location. If your opponent moves a unit into this Location you instantly get the -2 TH DRM against it, without going through the process of shooting a couple of rounds to Acquire it first. You can't combine Bore Sighting with Acquisition, though; it's either one or the other.</p>
<p>Bore Sighting is great if you see a choke-point that your opponent needs to pass through, like a road intersection. It is a nice benefit if you think you know where he'll be going, like a building he needs to capture (but you can only Bore Sight the ground level of a building [<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.42" class="topiclink">C6.42</a>]). It's nice to instantly get the equivalent of -2 Acquisition even if they just popped into your LOS. A nasty trick—if it works.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You have a new supply of HE rounds. I want you all to know that normally this would never happen, and we had to send out for these simply because you used up your supply so fast. &quot;Maybe we shouldn't be trying to use an AT Gun against Infantry. Sir.&quot; Sure, Lyman. And seeing how your Gun is supposedly designed for shooting at tanks, maybe the Germans would be polite enough not to send their Infantry after your position here. One does what one needs to do, Private.</p>
<p>Now that it's the next PFPh, let's try a longer range shot. See the simulated squad over in the woods in 4AA4? Trace your LOS along the hex-spine, just between the building you were focusing on before and the woods right next to them. Now do you see them? What would you need to hit? &quot;Range is 16 hexes, Infantry Target Type gives us a Basic TH# of 6, modified +1 for a L Gun and -1 for firing a Gun ≤57mm, giving a modified TH# of 6. Case Q gives them a +1 DRM for TEM, and Case R gives them a +1 for Hindrance from the Grain in hex 4W4. We need a DR ≤ 4 to hit, Sir.&quot; Yeah, not too promising. But before you shoot, let's look at another option.</p>
<p>So long as you are firing HE rounds, you could use the Area Target Type. That means your Basic TH# might get better, especially at longer ranges. There's also a bunch of Firer-Based and Target-Based Hit Determination DRM that no longer apply (marked by the red daggers on the left margin of the charts). You would no longer use Case Q (TEM) for your TH DR. So look through the TH tables again, and tell me what would you need? &quot;Area Target Type at a range of 16 hexes has a Basic TH# of 8, C4 gives us a -1 for a Gun ≤ 57mm, and a +1 for a L Gun for a modified TH# of 8. Case Q for TEM no longer applies, but Case R still gives us a +1 for the Grain Hindrance. We need a 7 or less, Sir.&quot; Much better chance of hitting. Area Target Type also gives you the benefit of affecting all in-LOS targets in the hex (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">C3.33</a>), even if in different Locations.</p>
<p>But of course there's also disadvantages to using the Area Target Type. If you hit, the TEM that you ignored for the TH DR now applies to the IFT DR (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.331" class="topiclink">C3.331</a>). Also, because you're using Area Target Type, all of your ROF is used up on the first shot (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.33" class="topiclink">C3.33</a>). And, what's most dramatic if you do hit, you must halve your FP on the IFT from the 6/50 column to the 2/30 column. So you've increased your chances to hit, but had to drastically decrease your chances of actually doing any damage once you hit.</p>
<p>Go ahead and roll for that 7 you needed. &quot;We get a 7. We get no ROF because this is Area Target Type.&quot; Right. But you do get to mark the hex with a ⅝&quot; -1 Acquisition counter. And with a DR of 7, you would have once again used up your HE Special Ammo. You'll keep drawing rounds from your special stockpile here, though. Roll for your effects on the IFT. &quot;We roll a 10 on the 2/30 column, and have to add 1 to the DR for TEM. No effect.&quot; Well, not too surprising. But there's more trickery that you can still pull off.</p>
<p>Our Player Turn ends, and during the German Player Turn the squad in 4AA4 stays put He wasn't too worried about that 2/30 column, it would seem. But if you can get another shot, you can use Bracketing (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.52" class="topiclink">C6.52</a>) to convert your shot from Area Target Type to the Infantry Target Type. In other words, switch your ⅝&quot; Acquisition counter on the hex to a ½&quot; Acquisition counter on the squad. This way, you keep the advantage of the Acquisition you placed last round, and that will help your TH DR a little bit more.</p>
<p>Okay, so you're using Infantry Target Type again. What do you need to hit? &quot;Basic TH# for ITT at a range of 16 hexes is 6, -1 for the range, +1 for a long barrel—modified TH# is 6. For DRM, C6 gives us -1 for Acquisition, +1 for TEM, and +1 for Hindrance. We need a 5, Sir.&quot; And what do you roll? &quot;We roll a 5, colored die is 4 so we hit but there's no ROF. And we flip the Acquisition counter over to -2.&quot; Excellent.</p>
<p>Now you roll on the 6/50 column of the IFT, with no modifiers. What do you roll? &quot;We get a 7, which is a NMC.&quot; Germans roll a 6, and pass their MC. But now their position isn't quite as safe as it looked last turn, is it? Nice work, boys.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Let's stop a moment. Remember when you learned about Critical Hits (CH) (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">C3.7</a>) with mortars? &quot;Yes Sir! You roll snake eyes, you double the IFT equivalent, and everybody dies.&quot; Er, more or less. Well there's good news and bad news about CH with the Infantry Target Type. The good news is it can happen without rolling snake-eyes. The bad news is, it takes a little more calculation, and often a snake-eyes won't get you a CH. First, recall how it usually works with a mortar using the Area Target Type. If you didn't need a 2 just to hit your target, then rolling a 2 means you got a CH. It works just the same with Guns when using either Area Target Type or Vehicle Target Type. But when using Infantry Target Type, you need to start paying closer attention.</p>
<p>With Infantry Target Type, if your Final TH DR is less than half of your Modified TH# (<a href="chc_chc4.htm#4.5" class="topiclink">C4.5</a>), you score a CH. You need to look more closely at this step. The Modified TH# is your basic TH# from C3, then you add in only the C4 Gun &amp; Ammo Basic To Hit Number Modifications. C5 and C6 from the TH tables are DRM—which literally means that they modify the DR, not the TH#.</p>
<p>On that last shot, your Modified TH# was 6. To roll less than half of this, you'd need to have a Final DR of 2. &quot;How is this different from a regular CH, Sir?&quot; Notice that you need a Final DR of 2, not an Original DR of 2. The last shot had a total DRM of +1 from the C5 and C6 tables, so even if you rolled snake-eyes, your Final DR would be a 3, and in this case you wouldn't necessarily score a CH. You would still have a chance, however, with a subsequent dr = 1 or ≤ half the Modified TH#.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there's no way for us to get a CH against those guys? What a rip-off.&quot; Pipe down Goetz. It isn't that bad. When using the Infantry Target Type, an Original 2 results in a possible CH. You make a subsequent dr and if that dr is ≤ half the modified TH# (or equal to 1), you get a CH. In our case, we would have needed a dr of 1, 2, or 3.</p>
<p>But we've seen cases where the DRM can add up to some big modifiers to your advantage. Let's look back at our simulated squad in the building at 4T3. What would your shot be if they spent 1 MF and moved out to S3? Assume this is not Assault Movement. &quot;Range is 8 hexes, so the Basic TH# is 7. C4 has no modifiers at this range.&quot; Okay, stop right there. So your Modified TH# is 7. This means you need a Final DR of 3 or less for a CH. Now, what DRM apply? &quot;Are they Dashing?&quot; No, just moving normally. &quot;Then we'd get Case J3 and J4 for FFNAM and FFMO, which is a -2 DRM.&quot; Right. Now the DRM applies before you look at your CH chances. You don't need to roll an Original 3 or less for a CH, you need to roll a Final 3 or less. Which means for this roll you'd need to roll 5 or less to score a CH. Now do you see how sweet this can get?</p>
<p>A quick rule of thumb: If you roll low (like a DR of 4 or less), back up and think about what you need to score an Infantry Target Type CH. Or, if Tables C5 and C6 leave you with a negative DRM, then step through the whole process. And the process is:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Find your Basic TH# from Table C3.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Calculate your Modified TH# from Table C4, and calculate the Final TH# needed for a CH.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Roll the dice.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Now apply any DRM from Tables C5 and C6, and see if you score a CH. And that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>If you do get a CH, you double your IFT equivalent. Your 6/50 would jump to the 12/70 column. A CH using Area Target Type goes from half FP to double FP (or four times the usual FP for that target type). And as if this wasn't bad enough on your target, any positive TEM it claimed is reversed to a negative TEM for the CH IFT resolution. So if you scored a CH on that squad in the woods, its +1 TEM would become a -1 on your IFT DR.</p>
<p>A Critical Hit doesn't necessarily affect every unit in a Location—if there's more than one to choose from, use Random Selection (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.9" class="topiclink">A.9</a>) to select your victim. Everyone else is still affected, but on the regular IFT column using the same IFT DR.</p>
<p><img src="blitz.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="Blitz" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Now let's try shooting at a vehicle. We have a parked German Opel truck down in 4P10. Use the Vehicle Target Type on the C3 TH Table. Because this is not an AFV, you'll probably do more damage if you fire a HE round at it. Also notice that this vehicle is outside your CA, so your first shot will require swinging your Gun around to point at it. Look through the TH tables and tell me what modifiers you see.</p>
<p>&quot;Range is 9 hexes, so the Vehicle Target Type gives us a Basic TH# of 9. C4 has no relevant modifiers. Case A 'Firer outside CA' is gonna apply, right Sir? What do we do?&quot; Okay. Ordnance that uses a Covered Arc has two different ways to swivel around. Some high-tech Guns, like the M1 40mm AA Gun, are on a 360° mount (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">C2.3</a>). These sorts of Guns pivot easily, and are considered Turreted Guns (T) for Case A modifiers. You can recognize a (T) mounted Gun by the white circle going around the Gun depiction on the counter. Your Gun, however, isn't designed for spinning quickly, and you treat it as a Non-turreted (NT) Gun. Those are the only two modifiers that apply to field artillery changing its CA—that middle modifier (ST) stands for Slow Traverse; it's a tank thing you might learn about another day.</p>
<p>Under Case A, you see a NT Gun gets a +3/+1/+1 modifier. This is the TH DRM the Gun gets for each hexspine it rotates. In your case, the first 60° turn to face hexspine K5-L4 would be a +3 DRM. If you rotated another hexspine for this shot to point at hexspine J4-K5, you'd get an additional +1 DRM, and if you rotated a third hexspine (and turned your Gun around to point due west towards hexspine J3-J4) you'd have another +1 DRM. So if you had to turn your Gun 180° to fire at someone behind you all in one shot, you'd start with a +3 +1 +1, or +5 DRM just for turning the Gun all the way around. Fortunately, you're only turning one hexspine to hex L5 so you'll get a +3 DRM for Case A. Remember, had you been in a building, woods, or rubble hex, this modifier would be doubled. Now keep reading down the TH Tables.</p>
<p>&quot;Case A is +3. Case P, Target Size is, er...normal, because the Opel has two black stars on its right edge. Case Q is +0 for TEM, but Case R is +2 for Hindrance from the Grain in 4N8 and O9. So our Modified TH# was 9, +3 DRM for C5, +2 DRM for C6. We need a 4 or less.&quot; Correct. And roll. &quot;We roll an 8, colored die is 2, so we miss but maintain ROF&quot; Barely. Remember that by changing your CA, you are using Conditional ROF (C2.5) and have to reduce the ROF of your Gun by one. Mark your target with Acquisition, and you get another shot.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have to pay for the Case A modifier again, do we?&quot; No, we've already turned the Gun and applied that modifier for the first shot, so it doesn't apply to this shot (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.12" class="topiclink">C5.12</a>). What do you need to hit? &quot;Modified TH# of 9, C5 is +0. For C6, Acquired Target gives us a -1, and +2 for Hindrance. A total of +1 DRM. We need an 8 or less TH.&quot; Right. And roll. &quot;We roll a 7, colored die is 3, so we hit and keep ROF.&quot; Dandy.</p>
<p>All Direct Fire hits against vehicles are resolved on the appropriate To Kill (TK) Table (C7) for the type of ammo you fired. To resolve an HE hit, you look on the <a href="tables_c7_34heandflametktable.htm" class="topiclink">C7.34 HE &amp; Flame To Kill Table</a>. &quot;Aren't we supposed to use the « column on the IFT?&quot; No, you'd only use that if you had fired Small Arms at the truck, or had hit the truck using the Area Target Type (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.34" class="topiclink">C7.34</a>). Looking at the HE TK Table, your Gun falls into the 50+ column. So against an unarmored vehicle you have a TK# of 10. Now take a quick glance at the C7.2 Obtaining Modified TK# Table— none of these affect your shot. Look at the Unarmored Vehicle Destruction Table. This shows us what your DR means, compared to your TK#. If you roll exactly the TK number (for this shot that would be a DR of 10), you only Immobilize the truck. If you roll &lt; your TK# (in this case 9 or less), you Eliminate the truck, and flip it over to its wreck side. And if your DR is ≤ half the TK# (in this case if you roll a 5 or less), you not only Eliminate the truck, you replace it with a burning wreck. Roll your effect.</p>
<p>&quot;We roll 10. Er...we only immobilized it, Sir.&quot; Well, that's okay. You still have ROF. Notice that your last two TH rolls were either equal to or above your HE Depletion numbers, and normally you wouldn't have any more HE rounds to fire. So, for the practice, let's fire off an AP round and see what's different. What do you need to hit? &quot;Like our last shot, the Modified TH# is 9, C5 is +0. For C6, Acquired Target is now -2, and +2 for Hindrance. A total of +0 DRM. We need a 9 or less TH. We roll a 9, colored die is 5. We hit, and lost ROF.&quot;</p>
<p>Excellent. Now this time, instead of looking on the HE TK Table, look at the AP To Kill Table. Look at the bottom of the chart, under &quot;Unarmored Targets,&quot; and look along Gun Size until you find the 37-57mm range. That says you have a Final TK# of 8. The Obtaining Modified To Kill# Table doesn't apply, since 8 is your Final TK#. &quot;Does that mean that a CH doesn't affect our TK#, sir?&quot; Good question, Valerien. A CH vs an unarmored vehicle still doubles the Basic TK# on the pertinent TK Table (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">C3.71</a>). Other than a CH, however, the Basic TK# vs an unarmored vehicle is the same as the Final TK#. Now, roll for effect just like you did for the HE shot. &quot;That means we need to roll 8 or less?&quot; Right.</p>
<p>&quot;We roll a 7, and Eliminate the truck.&quot; Had any passengers been on board, they'd now roll for Crew Survival (cs) (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">D5.6</a>). On the back of the Opel counter, you see the cs# is 6, so any Passengers need to make a DR of 6 or less to get out alive. Because the truck is unarmed, it only has an Inherent Driver (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">D5.1</a>) who never appears on the board as a separate counter. No need to worry about whether he survives or not, unless you're his mom. Of course, any hypothetical Passengers would have undergone a Specific Collateral Attack (<a href="chd_chdintro.htm#.8a" class="topiclink">D.8A</a>) from your earlier shot that Immobilized the truck using the same effects DR. Of course, a DR of 10 on the 6 FP column would have been no effect. But there is no Collateral Attack vs anyone who survives the Elimination of their vehicle.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, don't some vehicles have a capital &quot;CS&quot; on the back of the counter?&quot; Very observant, Valerien. That means the vehicle is armed and has an Inherent crew which can take counter form. Vehicle crews aren't Elite like Infantry crews, but they are qualified to fire Guns, whereas, even after I have trained you, you slobs would still have a tough time driving a tank.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> There's something else you could have done here. Remember how you paid +3 to change CA? That's pretty harsh. What if you had to turn even further? &quot;We'd add +1 for each additional hexspine, Sir.&quot; Right. And if you'd been in woods or a building, the modifier would have been doubled. Not good for your chances to hit. So instead of turning and trying a lousy shot, you could have not fired during our PFPh, and instead spent the phase to just change the Gun's CA to point at the truck. Then, during our AFPh, you could fire with only the Case B +2 modifier—H3 if in woods or a building (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.2" class="topiclink">C5.2</a>)—instead of all the modifiers from Case A (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.22" class="topiclink">C3.22</a>). I call this maneuver &quot;Twist'n'Shoot.&quot; Of course, if you fire during the AFPh, you can't utilize ROF (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.2" class="topiclink">C5.2</a>) or Intensive Fire (IF) (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">C5.6</a>). But it's an option to consider.</p>
<p>Another option to use in this situation is Opportunity Fire (<a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.25" class="topiclink">A7.25</a>). Just like other Infantry, during your PFPh you can choose to be marked with a Bounding Fire marker to show that you're saving your shot for the AFPh. This is useful, for instance, if you think an enemy unit might drop its concealment to fire during its DFPh. If you declare Opportunity Fire during the PFPh, you can then shoot without the Case B modifier during the AFPh. You also would lose any CX counter and its +1 DRM that would have applied in PFPh (since CX counters are removed at the start of your MPh). Unlike Guns that didn't declare Opportunity Fire and find themselves firing during the AFPh, you still can use ROF and IF. But being an Opportunity Firer, you couldn't change your Gun's CA during your PFPh—your Gun is basically &quot;frozen&quot; until its big moment in the AFPh. You'd change your CA (and pay the applicable Case A DRM price for it) during the AFPh.</p>
<p><img src="blitz.gif" width="71" height="70" alt="Blitz" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><img src="motion.gif" width="63" height="61" alt="motion" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, listen up. Hear that? There's another truck moving our way. And there it is, bouncing along in hex 4R2. Its counter is pointing at hex-spine R3-S3, so it'll be moving into either S3 or R3 unless it turns or stops. Or blows up. Just like Infantry, you can shoot at a moving enemy vehicular target during its MPh. Swing the CA around and do your best. What do you need TH?</p>
<p>&quot;Um, range is 7 hexes, so our Basic TH# using the Vehicle Target Type is 9. C4 has no modifiers for us at this range. In C5, we get a +3 for changing our CA back to the L3-L4 hexspine. Sir, does 'Bounding Firer' apply?&quot; No, that's an Attacker's trick, used while moving. &quot;Then no other C5 modifiers apply.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, I see you're hesitating at the modifiers under Case J. Let's look at what's new under C6 Target-Based Hit Determination DRM.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why the chart mentions both Moving and Motion Vehicles. A Moving Vehicle is something you see during your Defender half of a turn. To be a Moving Vehicle, the vehicle must either enter a new hex during its MPh, use Vehicle Bypass Movement, or begin the turn marked with a Motion counter. Once a vehicle moves, it remains a Moving vehicle through the end of AFPh. A Motion vehicle only shows up after your opponent's MPh when a vehicle that didn't spend an additional MP to Stop during its MPh is marked with a Motion counter. Your target, though, is Moving because it just entered 4R3 from R2. So you get the Case J +2 DRM.</p>
<p>Now look at Cases J1 and P. If a vehicle just popped into your LOS, you get some TH penalties because you didn't see it coming. J1 gives you an additional +1 if the vehicle has spent 3 MP or less in your LOS, alternatively P gives you a +2 if the vehicle has spent ≤ 1 MP in your LOS. Note that J2 is used instead of J1, if it applies. How many MP has the truck spent? &quot;One, Sir?&quot; No. Look at your Chapter B divider. For a truck to enter Open Ground, it must expend 4 MP per hex—definitely not a fast off-road vehicle. So even though you've only seen him enter one hex, it cost him 4 MP to enter that hex. That means neither J1 nor J2 would apply.</p>
<p>You can only fire once for each MP the truck spends in a Location (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.17" class="topiclink">C6.17</a>). So you have a choice: you could fire at him on his first MP in your LOS, and suffer a +4 DRM for Cases J2. You could fire on him on his second or third MP in the same hex, and suffer +3 for Cases J1. Or you could fire on him when he spends his fourth MP still in the same hex, and just suffer +2 for Case J. &quot;Why would we ever think of firing earlier, Sir?&quot; Well, if you wait until his fourth MP, fire, and maintain ROF, you can't use the ROF shot until he uses another MP. He might use his next MP to spoil your shot somehow. That's a call you have to make. &quot;Well, the terrain he's heading towards is still in our LOS, so he isn't going to disappear. We might as well wait until the fourth MP is spent, and save our ROF if he keeps moving.&quot; Good. An AFV might dispense some Smoke or Bounding First Fire, but this is just a truck.</p>
<p>So what do you need to hit? &quot;Modified TH# is 9, C5 gives us +3 for changing our CA, and by waiting until his fourth MP expenditure we pay only +2 from C6. Need a 4 or less to hit.&quot; Roll. &quot;We roll 7, colored die is 3, so we miss, keep ROF, and mark him with a -1 Acquisition.&quot; Nope. Boys, you changed your CA for this shot, so your ROF is reduced by one. You missed your ROF. It's all right. Just watch him drive.</p>
<p>What happens to your Acquisition when he moves? Remember back when you were firing mortars, you were using the Area Target Type and were targeting the whole hex. Anybody moving into the hex was in your Acquisition, and anyone moving out escaped. But with the Vehicle Target Type (and Infantry Target Type), your Acquisition stays with the target unit. So the -1 marker will stay on the truck. The truck spends 4 MP to enter R4, spends 4 MP to enter S5, and disappears from our LOS as it spends 4 MP to enter S6. Because the truck left our LOS, the -1 Acquisition counter remains in hex S5. If any enemy unit was foolish enough to move into that hex, you could immediately apply your Acquisition against it.</p>
<p><img src="pz4h.gif" width="71" height="73" alt="Pz4H" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> You've used HE and AP against Infantry and unarmored vehicles. Let's up the ante and try shooting at an AFV. And what do you know? Look what's coming down the road in hex 4S3. We got ourselves a PzKpfw IVH coming at us. It enters 4S3 from 4T2 with its bow and turret both pointing at the R2-R3 hexspine, so you're going to be shooting at its thickest armor. Stay calm, it's not much different than shooting at a truck. Unless you declare otherwise, everyone assumes you're firing AP at the tank because it's armored. What do you need to hit?</p>
<p>&quot;Range is 8 hexes, on the Vehicle Target Type our Basic TH# is 9. C4 adds no DRM at this range. In C5, we're pointed the right direction, so Case A doesn't apply. In fact, nothing applies in C5. For C6, we get +4 for Case J2 Moving and spending ≤ 1 MP in our LOS. Target Size Modifier is 0 for the tank. So we're base 9 with +4 DRM. We need a 5 or less.&quot;</p>
<p>Before you roll, I need to mention one additional condition. Your TH DR also determines whether you hit the tank in the hull—with its Armor Factor (AF) (<a href="chd_chd1.htm#1.6" class="topiclink">D1.6</a>) of 8, or in the turret—with its weaker AF of 6. If the colored die is ≥ the white die, you hit the hull. So just over half the time, that's where you'll hit. Otherwise, you hit the turret. Remember your TH DR now shows whether you hit, whether you maintain your ROF, and where you hit the tank, plus all the usual stuff like malfunction, sniper activation, Special Ammo Depletion if you fired it, and so on.</p>
<p>You will want to pay close attention to the AFV's Armor Factors, since they interact with your Gun's TK# and your DR to determine what happens to the AFV after a hit. Just under the AFV's MP are two AF numbers; the first is the Front hull AF, the second is the side/rear hull AF. The turret AF will be the same as the hull unless enclosed in a square (and it is higher) or enclosed in a circle (and thus lower).</p>
<p>Fire when ready. &quot;We roll an 8, colored die is 2. We miss, and maintain ROF.&quot; Put your -1 Acquisition counter on the tank. Now you have to wait. Even though you have ROF, it has only spent one MP in your LOS. So you have to see what it does before you can shoot again.</p>
<p>The tank spends one MP to move into hex R3. You can shoot now. &quot;Range is now 7 hexes, we still have a Modified TH# of 9. C5 has no modifiers that apply. In C6, now that he's spent 2 MP in our LOS we get +3 for Case P Moving instead of the +4 for Case J2. We also get the -1 for Acquisition, so the total DRM is only +2. We need a 7 or less TH.&quot; And roll. &quot;We roll a 9, and miss again. Colored die is 3, so we keep ROF and flip over the Acquisition counter to -2.&quot; Gotta love these high ROF Guns, don't you?</p>
<p>The tank continues to come towards us, and spends 1 MP to move into hex Q4. Fearless, ain't he? Fire; maybe you can show him the error of his ways. &quot;Range is 6 hexes, so we have a Modified TH# of 10. C4 and C5 still don't modify our TH. C6 throws Case J at us for a +2, and we've seen the tank spend 3 MP so far, so Case J1 still applies for a +1. We now get -2 for Acquisition, so we'll hit on 8 or less. We roll, and get an 6. A hit! Colored die is 3, white die is 3—so we keep ROF and hit the tank in the hull.&quot; Very good.</p>
<p>Now that you've hit, you need to roll a second time to determine the effect. Look at the <a href="tables_c7_31aptktable.htm" class="topiclink">C7.31 AP To Kill Table</a>, and glance along the GUN SIZE row until you find your Gun. You're not a mere 57, you're further to the right under the 57L. Cross-reference that with the BASIC TK# row, and you see a 15. That's the power behind your punch. Take a quick look through the Obtaining Modified TK# Table, and see if any of these cases apply. You see this isn't a Rear Target Facing, isn't Aerial/DC/MOL, isn't a Critical Hit, and the Range modifier for AP (back on the AP To Kill table) is zero at this range. Now look at the Obtaining Final TK# Table. This basically says you subtract your target's AF from your Modified TK#. Your TK# is still 15, and the frontal AF of a PzKpfw IVH hull is 8. Fifteen minus eight is seven. That's your Final TK#—the number you want to roll less than or equal to.</p>
<p>Now look over at the <a href="tables_7_7afvdestructiontable.htm" class="topiclink">C7.7 AFV Destruction Table</a>, under Bomb/Direct Fire. Looks a lot like it did when you shot the truck, doesn't it? If you roll less than your Final TK#, in this case a DR of 6 or less, you destroy the tank and flip it over to its wreck side (<a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">D10.1</a>). If your DR is ≤ half the Final TK# (in this case 3 or less), the tank is not only a wreck, it's a burning wreck (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.6" class="topiclink">C7.6</a>). If you roll exactly the TK#, you either Immobilize (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.5" class="topiclink">C7.5</a>) or Shock (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.4" class="topiclink">C7.4</a>) the vehicle, depending on whether you hit it in the hull or turret respectively. You hit the hull, so a DR of exactly 7 would Immobilize the tank. And if you rolled one more than your TK# (in this case if you rolled exactly 8), you score a Possible Shock (P. Sh) (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.42" class="topiclink">C7.42</a>). When using HE, one more than the TK is an automatic Shock. Let's examine these different results.</p>
<p>If a vehicle counter has a white wreck (<a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">D10.1</a>) depiction on the back, it gets flipped over when you destroy it. Little vehicles, like Jeeps, don't even leave a grease mark big enough to bother showing on the board if they get eliminated. But most vehicles have a wreck depiction, and the hulk becomes a +1 Hindrance for LOS traced through a hex with a wreck in it (<a href="chd_chd9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">D9.4</a>), and a +1 TEM for any Infantry hiding under the counter (<a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">D10.3</a>). The wreck side of a counter also displays the Crew Survival Number (CS#) for the vehicle.</p>
<p>If you rolled half of what you needed to score a kill, you create a burning wreck. This automatically kills the crew and any passengers, with no need to check the CS#. A burning wreck causes Smoke (<a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.2" class="topiclink">B25.2</a>) with a +2 LOS Hindrance.</p>
<p>A hit that is equal to or one greater than the TK number leads to some less certain results. I know you went over Immobilization and Shock as part of your light mortar training, so you may want to review your notes from that course. With a P.Sh result, the tank's crew must pass a NTC to avoid being Shocked.</p>
<p>Now that you've hit the tank, roll to see what the results are. &quot;We roll a nine. No effect?&quot; The shot bounces off their front armor. Hmm. Ah well, this happens. The tank spends another MP to move to hex P4.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Let's try firing some of your Special Ammunition—APDS—at the tank. APDS gives you a higher TK#, as well as To Hit penalties at longer ranges. But the TH procedure is exactly the same as for AP. You've just seen the tank spend another MP, so fire. &quot;Modified TH# is 10, +2 for Moving, -2 DRM for Acquisition, so we need 10 or less.&quot; Or 4 or less to fire APDS. If you roll higher than your Depletion Number, you lose your APDS, but it's as if you haven't even taken a shot yet unless you malfunction your Gun. You aren't marked with a Fire counter, so you could choose to fire at someone else. If this were your first shot in PFPh, you could even decide to move instead. Roll your dice. &quot;We roll a 2!&quot; Fantastic—that's a CH (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">C3.7</a>). Always remember to check your dice. Here you've managed to hit, in the Hull, kept ROF, and can still fire APDS in the future. A CH against a vehicle doubles your Basic TK# (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.72" class="topiclink">C3.72</a>).</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="tables_c7_32apcr-apdstktable.htm" class="topiclink">C7.32 APCR/APDS To Kill Table</a>. This is similar to the AP To Kill Table. Your Basic TK# is under the D57L column (D for APDS), which shows it to be 18. Look at the CASE D TK# CHANGE rows here. Both APCR and APDS are modified by range, much more so than AP. At this range, you're not affected. So your Final TK# is 28 (18 times 2 [for the CH] minus 8 [for the tank's hull AF] equals 28). Since rolling half your Final TK number or less, a 14 or less in this case, results in a burning wreck, that tank crew should be a little worried.</p>
<p>What is your TK DR? &quot;We roll a 12.&quot; Ouch. An original TK DR of 12 is always a Dud (<a href="chc_chc7.htm#7.35" class="topiclink">C7.35</a>), and has no effect on your target. &quot;That doesn't seem fair, Sir!&quot; I know, but at least it never happens when you're firing at Infantry. Consider yourself fortunate that you still have ROF. Just think, with your CH and your Dud, you're actually having average luck.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Look at the PzKpfw IV now. It just popped off its Smoke Dischargers. Seems its crew got a little worried with that APDS shot you just bounced off the tank. Because it successfully fired its sD, the tank marks its hex with a +2 Dispersed Smoke counter, spending another MP in our LOS. You can fire at it again if you want. &quot;Urnm, is now the time? I mean, it's up to something. Maybe we should wait and see if we get a better shot, Sir.&quot; That's a good point. Let's wait and see what it does.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the tank is turning. It's now spending one MP to change its VCA to face the O5-P5 hexspine, but keeping its TCA pointing towards you and your Gun to take advantage of its better frontal turret armor. Looks like the tank might be ducking out of our LOS, so now's the time to shoot. &quot;We'll try another APDS shot. Modified TH# is 10, +2 for Moving, -2 DRM for Acquisition, +2 for the Smoke, so we need 8 TH. We roll a 9, colored die is 5, so we miss.&quot; No, that's not right. You're firing Special Ammunition, so because you rolled over your Depletion Number, it's as if you haven't even fired yet. You now know you're out of APDS, but you can still act as if you hadn't shot yet. Try loading AP. &quot;Still need an 8 to hit it, we roll 11. Missed, no ROF.&quot; Hmm. And just like we thought—the tank spends its next MP to pull into P5 and out of our LOS.</p>
<p><img src="pz6g.gif" width="71" height="73" alt="Pz6G" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &quot;If that PzKpfw IV is bugging out, Sir, then why does it sound like it's getting closer?&quot; Well, son, take a look behind you. There's another tank pulling into 4F3, with its Gun and VCA pointing toward the G3-G4 hexspine. &quot;Holy cow! Look at the size of that thing! What is that?&quot; That's the new German heavy tank, the King Tiger. And it looks like it's here to help out its little buddy that you just scared off.</p>
<p>Now it's a new MPh. In spite of the fact that we're simulating a split-second decision, we're going to look in detail at what options you have to pursue. There are quite a few. First, let's look at the tank. It's driving Crew Exposed (CE)—awfully arrogant of its commander, but he looks confident. Its turret armor is 18, and its hull armor is a whopping 26.</p>
<p>Would AP stop such a beast? Even if you still had APDS to fire, you haven't had a Modified TK number yet that would be high enough to even threaten armor like that. It looks Like AP isn't an option unless you were lucky enough to score a CH, and even that might not work.</p>
<p>Can HE do anything different? Look at the <a href="tables_c7_34heandflametktable.htm" class="topiclink">HE &amp; Flame To Kill Table</a>. HE rounds have a Basic TK# of 10 for 57mm ammo. This isn't an improvement. But there's another HE rabbit you can pull out of your hat— you could fire HE using the Area Target Type. Remember how light mortars worked against AFV? You can do the same thing with your Gun, although you don't get ROF using ATT. When using ATT you still need to make a TH DR, but against this monster you're not too worried about the odds of missing, even though it would be easier to hit using Vehicle Target Type at this range with no TEM to worry about. If you hit, look at the IFT table. The 6/50 column for your Gun would be halved to the 2/30 column for using Area Target Type. Then you'd have to score a KIA to kill the tank, or a K/# or one greater than a K/# to cause automatic Shock or Immobilization. Since the Tiger's AF are all at least 8, you add one to your IFT roll (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.55" class="topiclink">C1.55</a>). The Tiger, however, isn't sitting in any terrain that would lend it a TEM bonus. So what do you need to hurt this behemoth? &quot;With the +1 to our DR because of its armor, we'd need to roll a 2 to Shock or Immobilize the Tiger, sir.&quot; This is not exciting yet. At least you're marginally more likely to have an affect than you were with AR.</p>
<p>You could also affect the exposed crew with an HE shot using the Vehicle Target Type. This is called a Specific Collateral Attack (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.14" class="topiclink">A.14, A.14A</a>). Using the same DR as for your almost futile TK against the tank, you check for an IFT effect on the 6/50 column against the exposed crew. But with the Tiger crew's 9 morale and +2 CE DRM, your small-caliber HE isn't likely to have an effect. But it's better than hoping for an AP CH.</p>
<p>Finally, you have one option that actually has a slightly-better-than-useless chance of doing some damage—you can make a Deliberate Immobilization Attempt (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.7" class="topiclink">C5.7</a>). This shot aims to damage the tracks of the tank instead trying to destroy the tank itself. To be able to try this, you must use Direct Fire, be within 6 hexes of the target, and your Ammo must have a Basic TK# greater than the target's lowest hull armor factor. But there is a price to pay. Look at Case G on the C3 To Hit Table. You get a +5 to your TH DR for Deliberate Immobilization, and you must get a hull hit. You aren't allowed to use any Acquisition, either, although the shot does allow placement of an Acquired counter on the tank for future regular shots. In your favor, the King Tiger's Target Size modifier (-2 for a Very Large Target) applies to your TH DR. If it all works, the tank is immediately Immobilized, forcing the crew to pass a TC to keep from Abandoning the tank (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">D5.5</a>). A Deliberate Immobilization shot never causes a Specific Collateral Attack, nor do you get a CH if you roll snake-eyes. Not a decisive outcome, but it looks to be your best hope. Sometimes, depending on the Victory Conditions you must fulfill, just stopping the tank might be every bit as effective as killing it. With all those TH DRM, let's try to affect the crew with an HE shot as we change CA and maybe try Deliberate Immobilization later.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> But as soon as you declare that you're going to shoot, the King Tiger chooses to declare a Gun Duel (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.2401" class="topiclink">C2.2401</a>). This means it's going to Bounding First Fire at us, trying to shoot you before you shoot it. &quot;How likely is it that it'll shoot first, Sir?&quot; It might be close. It's moving, but you have to turn your CA all the way around. To calculate who gets to shoot first, do this: add up all the C5 Firer-Based Hit Determination DRM that apply to each shot, plus if either you or the tank had Acquisition, you'd add that in, too. And the Brass Sez you would include the DRM of any Armor Leader the tank might have. The side with the lowest total modifiers gets the first shot. A moving tank has such heavy modifiers against it that it probably won't win a Gun Duel unless the opposing Gun must change its CA.</p>
<p>So what are your modifiers? &quot;We have to turn the Gun around, so Case A gives us +3+1+1 for a total of +5. Do we ignore the fact that the tank just came into our LOS?&quot; Yes, except for Acquisition, you only look at the Firer-Based DRM. We'll look at the rest of the modifiers if you get to shoot. The King Tiger, it applies Case C4, which includes Cases B, C, C1 and C2 (although doubling the lower dr doesn't count for Gun Duels). That's +2 for B, +2 for C, C1 doesn't apply, and +2 for C2. The Tiger's total is +6, and you win the first shot. Had the Tiger won the first shot, it would shoot before you turned your Gun to face him. Because you won, you turn the Gun and then shoot.</p>
<p>Okay, now for your shot. Fire HE and hope the crew gets hurt. You know Case A will be steep. What else applies? Remember, you're shooting for real now, so work your way through the whole chart. &quot;Modified TH# for Vehicle Target Type at this range is 10. Case A Firing outside our CA is +5, Case J Moving Vehicle is +2. Case J2 Defensive First Fire against a Moving Vehicle that's spent ≤ 1 MP in our LOS is +2, Case P Target Size Modifier is -2. We need a 3 or less to hit, Sir.&quot; Yeah, well, here's hoping. Roll? &quot;We get a 7, colored die is 6. We miss and lose ROF.&quot; And you place a -1 Acquisition on the Tiger. Now I suggest everyone duck.</p>
<p>The King Tiger gets its shot off with the 88, and misses. Not too surprising with the penalties for moving. It also fires its machine guns at us— that's a total FP of 10, halved to 5 for Bounding First Fire (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.31" class="topiclink">D3.31</a>), and halved yet again for non-Stopped fire. You still get your +2 for being Emplaced, and there's no effect. We're okay, so far.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> The King Tiger now spends one MP to Stop, and its remaining MP in Delay to end its MPh. You can now fire at it with only the Case J modifier, not the &quot;time spent in LOS&quot; modifiers of Cases J1 and J2 (<a href="chc_chc6.htm#6.16" class="topiclink">C6.16</a>.). &quot;Haven't we shot our wad, too, Sir? We lost ROF.&quot; Yes, but you can still Intensive Fire (IF) (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.6" class="topiclink">C5.6</a>).</p>
<p>Most Guns can Intensive Fire, and get one extra shot after exhausting ROF. You can't use IF during the AFPh unless using Opportunity Fire, but can during all other fire phases, although possibly with same-hex or adjacent-target restrictions during the DFPh (<a href="cha_cha8.htm#8.41" class="topiclink">A8.41</a>). Even Guns that have no ROF can IF, unless the Gun specifically says it can't. You can't use IF if you are Pinned or marked with a No Fire counter or Intensive Fire counter. In exchange for this extra shot you suffer some penalties. First, you gain a +2 TH DRM for Case F. Second, you have an increased chance of malfunctioning your Gun, and could even permanently disable it. Your B# is reduced by 2 and your original B# becomes an X#.</p>
<p>So let's use IF to try to Deliberately Immobilize the King Tiger during its MPh. What do you need? &quot;It's not a Moving Vehicle, is it?&quot; Yes it is. Even though the tank is Stopped, it still entered a new hex this turn, so it's still considered moving. &quot;Modified TH# is 10, Case F Intensive Fire is +2, Case G Deliberate Immobilization is +5. Case J Moving Vehicle is +2, Case N Acquired Target doesn't apply for Deliberate Immobilization, Case P Target Size DRM is -2. We need a 3 To Hit.&quot; And you need to hit the hull. Roll. &quot;We get exactly 3! Colored die is a 2, so it's a hull hit! It's immobilized!&quot; The German crew easily passes its Immobilization TC (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">D5.5</a>) and stays inside.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we are sitting in the gun sights of a King Tiger, who's probably more than a little bitter about the fact that it can't move anymore. Seeing how our Player Turn is coming up, we should acknowledge that discretion can be the better part of valor, and take this opportunity to abandon our position. We'll step down into K5 during our MPh and get out of the Tiger's LOS. You've done the best you can against it with this little Gun, and you can wait until somebody better prepared finishes the job.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Okay. While you're regaining your composure, let's talk about some unusual rules that you haven't seen today. Some Guns have a number in parentheses next to their caliber, like the M1 A2 37mm AA Gun. This number is the cannon's Infantry Fire Equivalent (IFE) (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.29" class="topiclink">C2.29</a>). Instead of rolling to hit and then rolling the effects on the IFT, you have the option to just roll the IFE value on the IFT, similar to firing a MG. The colored die of your IFT roll also determines if you keep your ROF, but your ROF is one less than normal when using IFE. IFE is not exactly like firing a MG, though, since you can't be part of a FG, for example.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;There are times when the modifiers just are too much, and practically add up to your Modified TH#. Normally, you'd assume that you couldn't hit. But there's always a very small chance to hit—no matter how many TH DRM you've accumulated. This is called an Improbable Hit (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.6" class="topiclink">C3.6</a>). If you roll an Original 2 that would normally miss, make a subsequent dr. A 1 is a CH, a 2 is a turret hit, a 3 is a hull hit, and 4-6 is a miss. If you're firing at Infantry, then 1 is still a CH, and 2 or 3 is a regular hit.</p>
<p>Similarly, while using any target type, if you roll a 2 when you needed—after all modifiers—a 2 just to get a hit, you don't automatically get a CH. Instead, you again make a subsequent dr (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">C3.7</a>) like you do with an Improbable Hit. A 1 on the subsequent dr means you get a CH after all, while any other result is a normal hit.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> We've been looking at tanks and Guns from later in the war. In the early days, though, many cannons didn't have as large a caliber as your 57mm Gun. These smaller Guns do, however, fire a lot faster than bigger Guns. To reflect this, Guns with a caliber of at least 15mm but no greater than 40mm get Multiple Hits (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.8" class="topiclink">C3.8</a>) if the firing unit rolls doubles on any successful TH DR that is not a CH. If you get a Multiple Hit, you can roll twice for the TK effects, choosing which result you want to use.</p>
<p>An Improbable Hit or CH never counts as a Multiple Hit. The first Multiple Hit always strikes the hull (since the DR was doubles, the colored die equals the white die), but the TK DR for the first Multiple Hit also doubles as a hit location DR for the second roll.</p>
<p><img src="81mtr.gif" width="72" height="71" alt="81mtr" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Let's look at an 81mm mortar counter—I want to reintroduce you to a bigger version of an old buddy of ours. When your Drill Sergeant first taught you about mortars, he didn't mention much about the larger mortars on ⅝&quot; counters. The rules for light mortars that you learned before are still just as applicable to Gun-sized mortars. Can you tell me anything that would be different between an 81mm mortar and a light, SW mortar?</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the 81mm requires a crew to fire without the Non-Qualified Use penalty, Sir. And it needs to declare a CA, so it suffers from the Case A Firer Outside CA modifiers.&quot; That's right. It's easy for you to say that now, but you can see why you might have overlooked all this during your introductory mortar training. Don't forget that a Gun-class mortar can be Emplaced and can Intensive Fire, too.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;One more special rule to keep in mind. Tanks have the option of overrunning a position (<a href="chd_chd7.htm" class="topiclink">D7</a>). I'm not going to get into the specifics of how a tank does this. I'll leave that to the tank commander. But if a tank is trying to overrun your Gun, and you've used up your ROF and your IF, you can still take just one more shot. This is called Overrun Prevention (<a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.64" class="topiclink">C5.64</a>). Similar to FPF, this final, desperate shot also counts as a morale check for you, the Gun crew. Hopefully, you won't be faced with a decision like this too often. When you get back to your barracks, your Drill Sergeant has a flowchart that explains the Overrun process in detail. I suggest you get a copy and review it.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Let's go back to your Gun in 4K4. I haven't heard the German crew swearing for a while now, so maybe they've left. Yup, all the hatches are open. We'll assume they are gone. Stop looking over your shoulders and let's get back to work. Swing your CA around to face east again, towards hex M4.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Look over at 4I2. See the wall? Infantry behind it would get the normal +2 TEM, but an AFV behind the wall gets an even better break. Since your LOF traces through the wall depiction, the tank would be Hull Down (HD) (<a href="chd_chd4.htm#4.2" class="topiclink">D4.2</a>) to your fire. Tanks on higher elevations can also maneuver to get into a HD position against fire from lower elevations. You shoot at a HD tank just like any other tank, but instead of using the Case Q TEM for the wall on your TH DR, you must hit the turret to have any effect. Otherwise, you hit only the wall, or the side of the hill against tanks HD behind a Crest Line. This means just over half your hits have no effect—a very nice position for a tank to be in. And, reasonably, you are not allowed to try a Deliberate Immobilization shot against a tank that is HD. &quot;Sir, since the colored die equals the white die on snake-eyes, wouldn't a CH always miss a HD tank, hitting the wall instead?&quot; No, you get a break here, a CH always hits a HD target in its upper superstructure.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> If a tank crosses a wall and you're within six hexes of the hex it's about to enter, you have a chance at an Underbelly Hit (<a href="chd_chd4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">D4.3</a>). First, you must trace your LOS through the tank's Vehicle Covered Arc (VCA) to a vertex, tank commander's choice, of the hexside being crossed. Then, if you score a Turret hit, you use the vehicle's Aerial AF, usually much lower than the tank's normal turret AF, on the resulting TK attempt. A sweet shot opportunity, if it arises. By the way, you can also score an Underbelly Hit if you're in front of and within six hexes of a tank that's climbing out of a stream or gully, or crossing a Bocage hexside.</p>
<p><img src="hmfile_hash_c83a4d47.gif" width="72" height="74" alt="37L gun" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, you have one more target type to try. We've shot at vehicles and Infantry, but let's see what it takes to hit an opposing Gun. We have a German 37mm Gun over in 4O3 pointing its CA at us. It is manned by more of our simulated Germans, this time by a crew.</p>
<p>When you are shooting at a Gun, you're just as interested in shooting the crew manning the Gun as you are in actually destroying the Gun. Anything, so long as that enemy Gun stops firing. There are three possible effects when shooting at a Gun—a miss, a Direct Hit against the Gun, or a Near Miss that affects the crew. The results of the latter two are tactically similar in that the enemy Gun stops shooting, but the mechanics can be different.</p>
<p>Attacks on the IFT, such as those by Small Arms or machine guns, are resolved just like you've always done against Infantry targets. Make a DR on the IFT and add in any applicable TEM. Unless it's in unusual terrain like the desert, an Emplaced Gun gets a +2 TEM if it doesn't claim any other TEM. If the Gun has a Gunshield (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.5" class="topiclink">C11.5</a>), its crew could claim the Gunshield's +2 DRM (+1 DRM against Indirect Fire) so long as you fired at the crew through the Gun's CA and the crew isn't claiming any other TEM (terrain or Emplacement). No surprises so far.</p>
<p>When firing ordnance at a Gun, you calculate your TH DRM and IFT effects just like you do when firing against Infantry—using either Infantry Target Type or Area Target Type. Let's compare these two choices.</p>
<p>Using the Area Target Type:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; The target Gun's size would modify the TH DR.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; The Gun's TEM (whether it used Emplacement, Gun Shield, or TEM—but not more than one) would apply to the IFT resolution.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; Your IFT equivalency would be halved.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; You must fire HE.</p>
<p>Using the Infantry Target Type:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; The target Gun's size would modify the TH DR.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; The TEM would apply to the TH roll instead of the IFT resolution.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; Once you hit, you use the full strength of your HE round.</p>
<p>• &nbsp; If you fire AP, you use the HE Equivalency Table.</p>
<p>If the target Gun has a Gunshield, there's an additional modifier to consider when you're firing ordnance. If you hit, you roll normally on the IFT. A KIA or K/# result is a Direct Hit (<a href="chc_chc11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">C11.4</a>), killing the crew and either destroying the Gun (if a KIA) or malfunctioning it (if a K/#). But any other IFT result must also add +2 for the Gunshield DRM. Also, a Gun and crew hit by a CH are both immediately eliminated (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">C3.71</a>). Let's try this shot out. We've been pointing at 4O3 for at least a turn now, so take your shot and ignore Case A.</p>
<p>&quot;Range is 4 hexes, we'll try a Infantry Target Type shot. We have a Basic TH# of 8. C4 has no DRM that apply, nor does C5. In C6, Case P Target Size gives us a +1, and Case Q TEM is +2 for being Emplaced. We need a 5 or less to hit.&quot; And roll. &quot;We roll a 7, colored die is 1, so we miss and keep ROF and gain a -1 Acquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>Try again with your undepletable HE. &quot;Same DRM as before, with an additional -1 for Case N Acquired Target. We need a 6 or less to hit. We roll a 6, colored die is 5. We hit, lose ROF, and flip the Acquisition counter over to -2.&quot; Very good. Now you're hitting the crew on the 6/50 column of the IFT. What do you roll? &quot;We get a 7, which is modified to a 9 by the Gunshield. Our NMC just became a No Effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't grouse too much. Since you're a Gun crew behind a Gunshield, you also get this benefit. Makes it all the more evident that Small Arms and MG fire can be more effective at clearing out a Gun crew than a tank's Main Armament. Okay, that's enough target practice for today.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;&quot;Sir? I remember from my Infantry training that Area Fire halved our firepower. How does that work with a Gun?&quot; It is important to keep straight the difference between Area Fire and Area Target Type. Using the Area Target Type halves your Gun's firepower on the IFT, but Area Fire (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">C.4</a>) does not. While there are several situations that result in Area Fire for a Small Arms attack, for your Gun the primary instance occurs when firing at a concealed unit, for which you must add the Case K +2 DRM to your TH DR. A Light Anti-Tank Weapon (LATW) (<a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.1" class="topiclink">C13.1</a>) firing out of a marsh or stream would also add the Case K DRM for Area Fire, as would ordnance firing at a gunflash at night. Firing SMOKE at an empty hex would not invoke the Case K Area Fire DRM. Smoke is a Special Ammo we'll leave to the expert gunnery course.</p>
<p>Well, you've seen the important parts of firing a Gun, but you should explore what happens if you ever need to move it. Let's leave your targets alone for a while, and worry about what you do to get underway. Meet me over at the M2A1 105mm artillery piece after a short break.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> TEN HUT!</p>
<p>Shooting is always fun, if not always easy. But what if you ever need to move your Gun? Manhandling is often not easy, and seldom much fun.</p>
<p>Some Guns need to be limbered before they can be pushed or towed. According to the back of your 57mm AT, your Gun is a QSU Gun, so it doesn't need to be limbered to move it (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.23" class="topiclink">C10.23</a>). Or unlimbered again after you've moved it. Examine a M2A1 105mm Howitzer counter (or look at its picture in Chapter H). Notice that instead of having malfunction information on the reverse of the counter, it has a limbered status. You'd flip this counter over to show that the Gun is limbered and ready to be moved. Some Guns can even fire when they're limbered (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.24" class="topiclink">C10.24</a>), like that infernal German 88 (the 8.8cm FlaK 18 o. 36). A crew or other manning Infantry can flip a Gun from its limbered side to the unlimbered side, or vice versa, during any Friendly Fire Phase in lieu of firing it. The crew, by the way, needs its full attention on this task, so it must be in Good Order and unpinned to limber or unlimber a Gun (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.111" class="topiclink">C10.111</a>).</p>
<p>Some Guns are so doggone big that they can't be limbered if they start out unlimbered, or vice versa, in the time frame of a scenario. These are called No Movement (NM) (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.26" class="topiclink">C10.26</a>) Guns. There are even bigger Guns, the truly heavy artillery, called Restricted Fire, No Movement (RFNM) (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.25" class="topiclink">C10.25</a>) Guns. They aren't meant to be in the cauldron of a battle, and they suffer some heavy TH DRM for up-close targets. I won't get into the specifics because these aren't very common. Just read up on them if you encounter a situation calling for one of these monsters.</p>
<p>Your 57mm Gun, however, is a QSU, and can be pushed or towed at the drop of a hat. Let me show you how to push a Gun. Check that. I'll tell you how you can push a Gun (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">C10.3</a>). Unless it's a QSU Gun, a Gun must be limbered before it can be pushed. You also can't move a Gun that has fired or changed its CA during this Player Turn (<a href="chc_chc3.htm#3.22" class="topiclink">C3.22</a>).</p>
<p>There are some steep movement penalties for pushing a Gun. You spend twice the normal MF to enter a Location, and while you're pushing you're conducting Hazardous Movement (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.62" class="topiclink">A4.62</a>). Plus, you can't be hauling anything else that costs PP. You can't move under a Wire counter or try a Minimum Move to get into a difficult hex (like uphill into the woods). You lose any chance for Road Bonus, but you can declare Double Time in an attempt to push your Gun further. On the front of the counter, in the white dot on your 57mm Gun, your Gun's Manhandling Number (M#) (<a href="chc_chc2.htm#2.27" class="topiclink">C2.27</a>) is shown as M10. Before you can Push a Gun into a new hex, you must make a DR ≤ its M#. The bigger the Gun, the lower the M#, and the lower you have to roll to Push it. Of course, this DR is subject to various DRM. The most common modifications come from the terrain you're trying to move into. Add both the TEM of the terrain and the number of MF you're about to spend to the DR. &quot;You mean the doubled MF for pushing a Gun, Sir?&quot; Afraid so. Look at the chart in <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.3" class="topiclink">C10.3</a>. Modifiers to keep in the back of your helmets include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If it's muddy or snowy (+3).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you can get another MMC to help you (-1 per additional HS).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If your Gun is marked with Low Ammo (fewer ammo boxes gives you a -2).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;If you're pushing across a Road hexside (-2).</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Any Labor Status you've accumulated (-1 or -2).</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent is any mention of leadership modifier. I can give you more MF to possibly move farther, but I can't make you push harder. For now, you're on your own. No need for me to be using Hazardous Movement. Give it a go.</p>
<p>How many MF would you need to push your Gun from 4K4 into K5? &quot;Entering Grain normally costs l½ MF, so this would cost us 3 MF, Sir.&quot; So add the TEM of 0 to your DR, and add the MF cost of +3. You need to roll a 7 or less to enter the hex. Try it. &quot;We roll a 6, and push the Gun into K5.&quot; Very good. Now during the same MPh declare Double Time to raise your MF up to 5, and push it back to K4. What was that you said, Appel? &quot;Er, I was just saying we need to make another DR, Sir.&quot; TEM is +0, MF is +2, so you need a DR of 8 or less. Go ahead and roll. &quot;We got an 8, Sir.&quot; Okay, if your Final DR is less than your M#, you push the Gun with no problem. If it's higher than your M# you stop, but you can mark yourself with a -1 Labor Status counter (or flip an existing -1 Labor to a -2 Labor). But if your Final DR equals your M#, you move the Gun into the hex but can go no farther. Either way, when you stop pushing the Gun, you're marked with a TI counter for the rest of your Player Turn. When you push the Gun into its new hex, you can set its CA to point in any direction you want. Point it east again, back at hex-spine L3-L4. Even though you're back in your initial hex, you've lost your Emplacement TEM because you moved the Gun.</p>
<p>Come next turn, try pushing the Gun into the woods in hex J4. What do you need to roll? &quot;Um, +1 for the TEM, and 44 for the MF cost for a total of +5. We need to roll a 5 or less, Sir.&quot; And roll. &quot;We get a DR of 9—so we staU here against this tree root, and are marked with a TI counter.&quot; And a -1 Labor Status counter, to help you next turn. Note how easily you got stuck with a Gun that is relatively easy to push. Just remember this next time you are thinking about pushing a Gun—it's not easy to do by yourselves unless you're heading for relatively open terrain.</p>
<p><img src="jeep.gif" width="74" height="70" alt="jeep" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> Okay, so pushing is a pain. Instead, you can try to recruit a passing vehicle to help you tow the Gun. That's why the Army put them here, right? Let's look at a Jeep. &quot;Is a Jeep big enough, Sir?&quot; The lower left of any vehicle counter shows the Towing Number (T#) (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.1" class="topiclink">C10.1</a>) for that vehicle. The T# must be less than or equal to your Gun's M# for the vehicle to be able to tow your Gun. As you can see the Jeep has a T10. &quot;So a Jeep can just barely tow our Gun!&quot; Right.</p>
<p>To Hook Up (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">C10.11</a>) or Unhook your Gun, the Jeep must spend half its MP and can't be in the middle of a Vehicle Bypass. This expenditure of MP doesn't mean the Jeep is actually moving, but it does count as an opportunity for the enemy to fire at you during your MPh (<a href="chc_chcintro.htm#.8" class="topiclink">C.8</a>). If the Gun's M# is in a circle, and I mean a true circle like we saw on the 105mm ART Howitzer we looked at earlier, not the white dot that shows a Gun is a Small Target, a vehicle would have to spend two-thirds of its MP to Hook Up or Unhook. Likewise, you crew members must be ready to get to work, so you can't fire the Gun or change its CA during the Player Turn you Hook Up or Unhook, plus you must be unpinned and in Good Order to do any hooking or unhooking (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.111" class="topiclink">C10.111</a>).</p>
<p>As the manning crew, you can automatically load onto the Jeep as you're Hooking Up. &quot;Geez, Sir, is there still room? That Jeep looks like its gonna drag on the ground.&quot; Any time a vehicle is towing a Gun, its PP is reduced by 4 for all your ammo boxes (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a>). If this Gun were 100mm or bigger, it would cost the vehicle 8 PP for the ammo. A Jeep has 9 PP, your ammo takes up 4 PP, and a crew takes up 5 PP (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">D6.1</a>). So long as there isn't any spare SW already in the Jeep, there's just barely enough room for you and the Gun. &quot;Looks like you'll be walking, Sir.&quot; Drop and give me 50, Tracy. No, a SMC doesn't take up any room unless there's more than four of us. Don't get comfortable just yet. I'd like to show you what you do with a towed Gun. Unhooking a Gun is just the opposite of Hooking Up. You can Unload from your vehicle and Unhook the Gun in one MPh if you want.</p>
<p>No matter what, though, if you Hook Up a Gun both towing vehicle and Gun crew (Gun crew only if Unhooking) are marked with a TI counter for the rest of the Player Turn. <span class="f_Highlight">[errata included]</span> &nbsp;So you can't Hook Up and drive off in one Player Turn, and you can't Unhook and fire in one Player Turn.</p>
<p>If you're in a hurry, or if the vehicle's MP were too few to make it all the way to your hex this turn, you could push your Gun into the hex with a vehicle and then Hook Up (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">C10.31</a>). The only trick is, you have to be able to hypothetically push the Gun another hex—you can't be out of MF So you need to roll less than your modified M# (because if your rolled equal to the M# you would have to stop).</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Let's look at the 81mm Mortar counter again. Notice it has a M#, so moving it will be like moving a Gun (unlike the light Mortars you carried as a SW). Additionally, you can dismantle a mortar that's between 76mm and 82mm and replace it with a ½&quot; counter that costs 5 PP to lug around. This is nominally more portable than pushing it like a Gun. If you wanted to transport it on a vehicle, the dismantled mortar would take up only 4 PP (<a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.13" class="topiclink">C10.13</a>), with no additional cost for the ammo boxes. So if you loaded this on a Jeep, with a 9 PP capacity, you could put the mortar (at 4 PP, not 5 PP like it says on the counter) into the back, and there'd still be room to haul you crew members. On the other hand, if you were a Rider on the back of a vehicle, like on an AFV, you'd still have to use the 5 PP cost for a dismantled mortar (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">D6.2</a>).</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n</span> &nbsp;Well, that's it. I've taught you the complete Guns and Advanced Ordnance Principles training course. This hasn't been an exhaustive description of absolutely every rule relating to Guns and ordnance, but it certainly covers most the points that you'll need to know to use them. As always, you should become familiar with the rulebook and be comfortable with finding what you need to know in there.</p>
