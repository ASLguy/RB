It is depicted on the RB map by the presence of a dark gray &quot;floor&quot; covered by debris and, aside from not having a roof, is considered a building in all respects. A unit may never gain Rooftop status in a Roofless Factory Hex.</p>
<p><a id="5.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.41 FACTORY DEBRIS:</span> All non-rubbled Roofless Factory Hexes contain debris (<a href="cho_cho1.htm" class="topiclink">1.</a>). Factory debris is not Inherent Terrain (i.e., it exists only within the building depiction), and may not be Cleared. Only building (not Factory debris) TEM applies to a Direct Fire attack whose LOS is not traced entirely within the Factory (see the entry for &quot;<a href="cho_cho5.htm#5.43x2" class="topiclink">Squad J</a>&quot; in the illustration for the second 5.43 example) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if the firer's LOS enters the target's Roofless Factory Hex within the building depiction (see the <a href="cho_cho5.htm#5.43x1" class="topiclink">first 5.43 example</a>)]</span>. Indirect Fire, and Direct Fire whose LOS is traced entirely within the Factory to a Roofless Factory Hex, is subject to both Factory TEM (+1) and Factory debris TEM (+1). Moreover, LOS (and Indirect Fire) that incurs the +1 Factory Hindrance of a Roofless Factory Hex also incurs that hex's +1 debris Hindrance, for a total of +2 per-hex LOS Hindrance (an EXC to the last sentence of <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.7" class="topiclink">A6.7</a>).

Squad H, if fired on by squad C, would receive a +6 DRM (+2 for the Factory and debris Hindrances in L16, +2 for the Factory and debris Hindrances in K17, and +2 for the Factory and debris TEM of K18).

<p><a id="5.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.43 ROOFTOP LOS:</span> Since it lacks a roof, a unit in a Roofless Factory is more vulnerable to fire from above (and vice-versa). For game purposes, the dark jagged artwork delineating the interior edge of the roof acts like a hill Crest Line (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.2" class="topiclink">B10.2</a>); however, LOS may be traced directly along such a hexside (even if also an Interior Factory Wall hexside) just as if tracing it along a cliff hexside (<a href="chb_chb11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">B11.2</a>).<a href="cho_chofootnotes.htm#5" class="topiclink">5</a> The Rooftop artwork extending into a Roofless Factory Hex never itself blocks LOS. Barring other LOS Obstacles, a unit on or higher than a Factory roof has no LOS into roofed ground-level Factory Locations past the first such Location its LOS enters.

If firing at the ground level of O15 it incurs the +1 Factory TEM of that target hex; if firing at O16 it incurs a +2 Factory debris TEM; if firing at O17 it incurs the +3 stone-building TEM.

An Original SMOKE source in a Roofless Factory Hex does Drift if there is a Mild Breeze, but only at ≥ that Factory's full-level height equivalent. Such Drifting SMOKE is placed on a Level counter corresponding to the height of the Factory (e.g., on a Level One counter if Drifting in/from a 1½-level Factory, or on a Level Two counter if Drifting in/from a 2½-level Factory) in each hex it Drifts into <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: it is placed on a Roof counter if Drifting into a roofed hex of that Factory]</span>. Such Drifting SMOKE rises from the Level/Roof counter it is placed on to the same height as that of its Original SMOKE source.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The wind is blowing to the northeast. The Original (level two) smoke source in R12 (in a 1½-level Factory) Drifts into S12 (at rooftop level). Since all Drifting SMOKE from an Original SMOKE source in a Roofless Factory Hex is at &gt; ground level, the squads at ground level in the illustration have unhindered LOS to each other. If squad R were to fire at a rooftop-level unit in S12 the smoke Hindrance would be +4 (+2 for the first-level smoke in T11 and +2 for the rooftop-level smoke in the target hex; <a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.8" class="topiclink">A24.8</a> would not apply since the in-hex smoke is not in the firer's Location). Were the R12 Factory 2½ levels high, level-two smoke in the Factory would not Drift because the 2½-level S12 Factory is higher than the level-two smoke, thereby preventing its Drift.</span></p>
