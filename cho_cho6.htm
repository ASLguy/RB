The RB Cellar level is ignored when determining the Base Level of a building hex.</p>
<p><a id="6.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.11 FORTIFIED:</span> A RB Cellar Location is always considered to be a Fortified Building Location with a TEM of +4 <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: +3 if wooden]</span>. All Fortified Building rules apply except as stated otherwise. A RB Cellar Location can be Breached (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.9221" class="topiclink">B23.9221</a>) only across a hexside that is common to an ADJACENT RB Cellar Location.</p>
<p><a id="6.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.2 ENTRY:</span> Only Infantry/SW may setup-in/enter a RB Cellar, and their presence therein is indicated by placing them beneath a Cellar counter. Infantry may enter/exit the RB Cellar level only via a Stairwell, Manhole, or &quot;connecting&quot; Trench or Tunnel, and only as per <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.922" class="topiclink">B23.922</a> <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: see <a href="cho_chointro.htm#.2a" class="topiclink">O.2A</a> and <a href="cho_cho11.htm#cg6" class="topiclink">SSR RB6</a>]</span>. Infantry already in a RB Cellar may directly enter an adjacent RB Cellar Location only if the two hexes involved share a building hexside, as determined by the building's depiction <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Rowhouse]</span>.</p>

It is not ADJACENT to the RB Cellar Locations of B24 and C24, as hex C25 does not share a building hex-side with either.</span></p>
<p><a id="6.21"></a><img src="trench.gif" width="73" height="70" alt="TRENCH" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6.21</span> All Trench &quot;connections&quot; (<a href="cho_cho11.htm#cg6" class="topiclink">SSR RB6</a>), Manholes, and Tunnel entrances/exits &quot;open into&quot; the RB Cellar level if it exists in that hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if the ground level above the RB Cellar has been Rubbled; <a href="cho_cho6.htm#6.6" class="topiclink">6.6</a>]</span>; otherwise, Sewer/Tunnel (<a href="chb_chb8.htm" class="topiclink">B8.</a>) and Trench (<a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.5" class="topiclink">B27.5</a>) rules are unchanged <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a tunnel's entrance and exit Locations may be at different levels]</span>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: see the 6.2 illustration. The squad in the D24 trench may directly enter the C25 (or C24) RB Cellar Location at a cost of two MF (see also <a href="cho_cho11.htm#cg6" class="topiclink">SSR RB6</a>). The only other Locations from which the C25 RB Cellar Location may be entered are the two Locations ADJACENT to it (see the <a href="cho_cho6.htm#6.2ex" class="topiclink">6.2 EX</a>) or via Sewer movement (since C25 is a Manhole Location) or a connecting tunnel.</span></p>
<p><a id="6.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.3 LOS:</span> Infantry in a RB Cellar tracing LOS outside of their building's depiction to a non-ADJACENT Location do so as if entrenched at ground level (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>), and trace LOS to an ADJACENT Location in the normal manner (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.25" class="topiclink">B23.25</a>; <a href="chb_chb8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">B8.2</a>). There is no LOS between adjacent RB Cellar Locations across a Rowhouse black bar hexside <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Breached; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.711" class="topiclink">B23.711</a>]</span>. A unit in a RB Cellar Location may never claim Wall Advantage.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="cho_cho6.htm#6.2ex" class="topiclink">6.2 illustration</a>. The squad in the C25 RB Cellar has a LOS to the ADJACENT RB Cellar Location in B25 (despite the actual LOS going outside the building depiction). However, squad B does not have a LOS to hex D23 (due to wall hexside C24-D24), since it traces LOS outside of its building depiction to a non-ADJACENT Location as if entrenched at ground level. A unit in D25 would never receive Height Advantage for an attack from the C25 RB Cellar.</span></p>
<p><a id="6.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.4 FIRE EFFECTS:</span> The Inherent FP of a unit/FG in a RB Cellar is halved as Area Fire if the LOF leaves their building's depiction and is not traced to an ADJACENT RB Cellar Location, and the US# of the unit(s) currently using such Inherent FP is ≥ 3. (A leader directing fire from an RB Cellar Location does not add his US# for this calculation.) Otherwise, a RB Cellar has no effect on the use of SW/Inherent-FP other than those normally caused by being fired in a building. A DC in a RB Cellar may be Thrown only into an ADJACENT Location.</p>
<p><a id="6.5"></a><img src="blaze.gif" width="63" height="62" alt="BLAZE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6.5 BLAZE SPREAD:</span> A Blaze may spread from (or to) a RB Cellar Location only to (or from) an ADJACENT Location.</p>
<p><a id="6.6"></a><img src="rubblestone.gif" width="72" height="72" alt="RUBBLESTONE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">6.6 RUBBLE: </span>A RB Cellar Location can be rubbled like any other building Location. If a RB Cellar Location is rubbled, it and all other building Locations in that hex cease to exist and the appropriate Rubble counter is placed at ground level in that hex. All occupants, weapons, Tunnel-entrances/exits and Manholes in that hex are eliminated, as is its Fortified Building status (if any), and an AFV can no longer fall into it (<a href="cho_cho6.htm#6.62" class="topiclink">6.62</a>; <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.4" class="topiclink">B24.4</a>). If the ground-level Location above a RB Cellar is rubbled, the appropriate Rubble counter is placed at ground-level on top of a Cellar counter. The RB Cellar Location beneath such still exists, but all LOS out of that Location across a non-building hexside is blocked. Trenches no longer &quot;connect&quot; to a RB Cellar Location if the ground-level Location above it has been rubbled, though a tunnel entrance/exit and Manhole are unaffected.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The ground- and first-level Locations of M6 have been rubbled as signified by a stone rubble counter on a Cellar counter in that hex. Movement and LOS from RB Cellar Locations L5 to M6 (and vice-versa) is still possible. However, if the rubble counter were placed in the hex not atop a Cellar counter (thus signifying that all building Locations in that hex are rubbled at ground level), the RB Cellar Location in that hex would cease to exist. Movement at RB-Cellar-level directly from L5 to N5 (and vice-versa) via M6 would not be possible without first ascending to ground level in L5 and N5.</span></p>
<p><a id="6.61"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.61 STAIRWELL:</span> A stairwell between the RB Cellar level and ground level is affected in the normal manner if that ground-level Location is rubbled (<a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.4" class="topiclink">B24.4</a>).</p>
<p><a id="6.62"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.62 COLLAPSE:</span> The <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.41" class="topiclink">B23.41</a> cellar rules apply unchanged to a RB Cellar. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: An AFV falls into an RB Cellar if the Original colored dr of the Bog Check is ≥ 4. If the crew of such an AFV survives, it may automatically attempt to Scrounge the AFV and the crew is then placed in the RB Cellar Location instead of at ground level. In all cases the AFV is eliminated and leaves no wreck. Each Infantry unit in such a RB Cellar Location must take an immediate NMC; if it fails this NMC a dr (r) must then be made for each SW it possesses: a 6 eliminates that SW and a 4-5 result malfunctions it.]</span> The removal of an AFV for falling into a cellar in a single hex building does not create a RB Cellar Location in that hex.</p>
<p><a id="6.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.7 &nbsp;ENCIRCLEMENT:</span> The principles of <a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.72" class="topiclink">A7.72</a> (Upper Level Encirclement) do not apply to RB Cellar Locations; i.e., a unit in a RB Cellar is not Encircled merely by having no exit to ground level.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="cho_chofootnotes.htm#7" class="topiclink">7</a></span></p>
<p><a id="6.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.8 &nbsp;SMOKE:</span> Smoke placed at ground level does not extend INTO a Cellar Location. LOS from a Cellar Location to a ground-level Location is affected by Smoke at the ground level of the Cellar unit's hex but the +1 Hindrance for firing out of SMOKE (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.8" class="topiclink">A24.8</a>) is NA.</p>
