<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">RB SSR: SPECIAL RULES for all RB Scenarios</span></h1>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, all SSR below apply in all RB scenarios—both CG and non-CG type.</p>
<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB1.</span> EC are Moist, with no wind at start.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB2.</span> Sewer Movement is allowed. Russians may use it freely; Germans may use it only if a leader passes a 4TC (<a href="chb_chb8.htm#8.4" class="topiclink">B8.4</a>). A unit may use Sewer Movement to cross from one side of a gully to the other only if it ends its MPh in the Sewer Location of a gully-Manhole hex (e.g., hex Y38). A unit entrenched in a Manhole Location (see <a href="cho_chorbssr.htm#5" class="topiclink">SSR RB 5</a>) may not enter that hex's Sewer Location, since a unit may enter a Sewer only at the very start of its MPh (<a href="chb_chb8.htm#8.4" class="topiclink">B8.4</a>).</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB3.</span> Rooftops (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.8" class="topiclink">B23.8</a>) are in effect. Control of a Rooftop/Sewer Location never counts as Controlling a building Location.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB4.</span> The river (i.e., the Water Obstacle hexes in the northeast corner of the map area) is Flooded (<a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.122" class="topiclink">B21.122</a>; <a href="chb_chb21.htm#21.21" class="topiclink">B21.21</a>) with a Heavy current flowing north to south. Hex CC31 contains a one-lane wooden bridge; all other bridges are two-lane stone.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB5.</span> Hidden-Mines/Entrenchments (including A-T Ditches; <a href="chb_chb27.htm#27.56" class="topiclink">B27.56</a>, <a href="cho_cho11.htm#11.621" class="topiclink">O11.621</a>) may be placed in a paved-road hex that also contains shellholes; mines set up thusly can attack regardless of whether or not the unit entering their Location is using the road rate/bonus. A roadblock may also be set up IN a gully or Culvert to block a gully/Culvert hexside. A roadblock IN a gully or Culvert may be crossed by Infantry only via a Minimum Move, does not affect Bypass in adjacent Level 1 Locations, and for LOS purposes is treated as a wall at Level 0 (the level of a unit IN a gully on the RB map).</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB6.</span> Trenches (including A-T Ditches) are considered to &quot;connect&quot; (as per <a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.8" class="topiclink">B30.8</a>) to (but not through) all ADJACENT building/rubble Locations <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: not to a Location that is rubbled during play of that scenario]</span> (see also <a href="cho_cho6.htm#6.21" class="topiclink">O6.21</a> and <a href="cho_cho6.htm#6.6" class="topiclink">O6.6</a>, last sentence). Infantry entering such a building/ rubble Location need not pay an extra MF to leave the trench in that Location, but must still pay applicable building/rubble COT. Infantry leaving such a building/rubble Location need not pay an extra MF to enter a &quot;connecting&quot; trench. Infantry may not enter such a trench while using Bypass Movement; nor may they use Bypass Movement while in such a trench; nor may they exit such a trench to directly use Bypass Movement. A unit entering/ leaving a building/rubble Location via a &quot;connecting&quot; trench is not subject to Snap Shots as it does so. A vehicle must pay the appropriate MP-costs/penalty to cross such a trench while using VBM; hence those vehicle types not allowed to cross a trench may not do so while using VBM. Infantry may enter a Fortified Building Location as if that Location were not Fortified provided they enter it from a trench/AT-Ditch that is &quot;connected&quot; to that building Location.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB7.</span> Due to superior German aerial reconnaissance, Entrenchments/Wire given-in/purchased-for any Russian OB may not be set up using HIP.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB8.</span> Rubble is treated as a building for Ambush (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">A11.4</a>) and Street Fighting (<a href="cha_cha11.htm#11.8" class="topiclink">A11.8</a>) purposes.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB9.</span> German Air Support, when available, is always in the form of Stuka M42 with bombs. The actual number received and their turn of arrival is still determined as per <a href="che_che7.htm#7.2" class="topiclink">E7.2-.21</a>.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB10.</span> All Locations <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Aerial; IN a Sewer or Culvert]</span> are eligible sniper target Locations.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB11.</span> Hand-to-Hand CC (<a href="chj_chapj.htm#2.31" class="topiclink">J2.31</a>) is allowed in all RB scenarios; markers to indicate Hand-to-Hand status are provided in the RB countermix.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB12.</span> For both sides: neither 150+ mm OBA nor any Rocket OBA may fire Smoke; no OBA may fire WP; only MTR OBA and German 100+ mm OBA may fire IR.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB13.</span> ATMM (<a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.7" class="topiclink">C13.7</a>) are available to elite (only) German Infantry, but only on an ATMM Check Original dr of 1 (i.e., no drm apply). The effects of an Original 6 dr remain unchanged.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB14.</span> No Quarter (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.3" class="topiclink">A20.3</a>) is in effect for both sides.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB15.</span> Russians always have a Level C Booby Trap capability <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: in the CG they may increase it to Level A or B by CPP expenditure]</span>. Booby Traps are active over the entire RB map, but are activated only by appropriate German TC. Mines factors may not be exchanged for Booby Traps. Germans have no Booby Trap capability.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB16.</span> A tunnel entrance/exit may cross a cliff hexside provided that tunnel begins or ends in the lower-level hex and &quot;crosses&quot; that cliff hexside, and the Base Level of that cliff hex is one level lower than that of the hex at the other end of the tunnel.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB17.</span> Any road exiting a map edge on the RB map is considered, for purposes of <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">A2.51</a>, to extend off that map edge along that lettered hexrow (if off the north or south edge), or in hexes of the same coordinate (if off the west or east edge). The off-map road is considered of the same type (paved/dirt) as the road hex it is connected to on the map. For instance, paved roads extend off the north edge along hexrows D, V and Y, and dirt roads extend off the east edge along hexes with a coordinate of 38, 40 and 43. All terrain on the off-map setup area is still considered Open Ground. If units are setup to enter (as per <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">A2.51</a>) they must enter during that Player Turn or be forfeit <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: in the RB Campaign Game such unentered units may not enter during that scenario but are Retained for the next CG scenario]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><span class="f_Strong">RB18.</span> All Good Order Russian elite and first line Infantry are Stealthy.</p>
