<h1 class="p_Heading12"><span class="f_Heading12">2. SLOPE HEXSIDES</span></h1>
<p><a id="2.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.1</span> A slope hexside<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chp_chpfootnotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">2</a></span> represents an undulation in the terrain substantial enough to give an Up-Slope (<a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.2" class="topiclink">2.2</a>) unit a LOS advantage. On the KGP maps a slope hexside is represented by brown hash-marks along that hexside (EX: StG9-F8). The entire hexside (inclusive of vertices) marked by a slope, but not the slope artwork itself, is considered part of that slope hexside.</p>
<p><a id="2.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.2 UP-SLOPE/DOWN-SLOPE:</span> A Location whose hex contains ≥ one slope hexside is either Up-Slope or Down-Slope to LOS drawn across that hexside to or from that hex. If the slope lines are in the Location's hex, the Location is defined as being Down-Slope across that hexside; if the lines are in an adjacent hex along the hexside common to both hexes, the Location is Up-Slope across that hexside. A Location can be both Up- and Down-Slope across two different slope hexsides.</p>
<p><a id="2.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.3 LOS:</span> Slopes are neither obstacles nor Hindrances. Being Up-Slope affects LOS only in that an Up-Slope Location is treated as being ¾ of a level higher than normal to LOS that begins or ends in that Location and crosses an Up-Slope hexside of that Location.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chp_chpfootnotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">3</a></span> Thus, barring other obstructions to LOS, an Up-Slope unit—even if not in a hill Crest-Line hex—can trace a LOS across an Up-Slope hexside of its hex to a lower elevation (i.e., across a hill Crest Line) and/or over (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">B.4</a>) obstacles and Hindrances whose topmost obstacle/Hindrance height is &lt; the Up-Slope elevation of the viewing unit <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: entrenched LOS restrictions would still apply as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>, as would wall/hedge TEM as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">B9.3</a> (see also <a href="chp_chp6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">6.2-.3</a>)]</span>. Otherwise, being Up-Slope or Down-Slope itself has no effect on LOS (e.g., slopes are ignored if the LOS goes through their hex or along their hexside, and also when calculating an <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.41" class="topiclink">A6.41-.43</a> increase or decrease in the number of Blind Hexes caused by an intervening obstacle). Being Up-Slope itself can neither grant HA nor allow an Up-Slope unit to make a HD attempt. The presence of ≥ one slope hexside does not change the elevation of that hex's Base Level.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="p23.jpg" width="529" height="470" alt="p23" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: Squad A's LOS to squads B, E and F (and to hex J13) is unaffected by slopes. Squad A (which is at Level 3) has no LOS to Level 2 squads G, C or D. Squad B has a LOS to all squads depicted. Squad B could claim Height Advantage only if fired on by squad G or squad(s) C/D. Squad E can see squads A, B and F. Squad F has a LOS to squads A, B, D and E; however, it could see squads C and G (and hex I12) as well if it were Up-Slope from them along hexside K13-L13. In all cases, LOS reciprocity (<a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.5" class="topiclink">A6.5</a>) applies. See also the <a href="chp_chp6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">6.2</a> example.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If hexes J11-K12 contained a two-hex Two Story House (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.22" class="topiclink">B23.22</a>), K11 would be a Blind Hex to squad B but L10 would not be (since the building's topmost height would be Level 3½ whereas squad B is at Level 3¾ due to its being Up-Slope along that LOS).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">An AFV/wreck in J13 would Hinder squad A's—but not squad B's—LOS to squad E (and vice versa), but would not Hinder squad A's/B's LOS to squad F (or vice versa). An AFV/wreck in H12/I13, and/or a wall/hedge/slope along hexside(s) H11-H12/H12-I13, would not Hinder squad B's LOS to/past squad G.</span></p>
<p><a id="2.31"></a><img src="firelane2.gif" width="61" height="62" alt="FIRELANE2" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.31 FIRE LANE:</span> For the purposes of Fire Lane LOS/LOF drawn across ≥ one slope hexside, assume that the term &quot;same-level&quot; means &quot;same-Base-Level&quot;. See also <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.42" class="topiclink">2.42</a> and its example.</p>
<p><a id="2.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.4 COVER:</span> A slope can, in certain instances, provide a +TEM (<a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.41" class="topiclink">2.41</a>) or a +DRM (<a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.42" class="topiclink">2.42</a>).</p>
<p><a id="2.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.41 DIRECT-FIRE TEM:</span> Ground-level Infantry in a hex containing ≥ three (or two non-contiguous) Down-Slope hexsides may claim a +1 slope TEM vs Direct Fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: FT]</span>, provided the attack originates from a non-adjacent firer whose elevation advantage (if any) over that of the target is &lt; the range of the attack and the attacker's LOS crosses ≥ one of the target hex's Down-Slope hexsides. (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">A.5</a> applies to a FG attack.) Slope TEM is cumulative with no other +TEM <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Mud/Deep-Snow TEM]</span>). Being Up-Slope itself provides no TEM, does not negate the FFMO/FFNAM DRM, and does not affect Wall Advantage rules.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">2.3</a> illustration, and assume that the following attacks are Small Arms. Squad E can claim slope TEM if fired on by squad B (or from hex J12 or H14), but not if fired on by squad A (whose LOS does not cross a Down-Slope hexside of K14) or from H12, I12, etc. Squad F can fire on adjacent squad E with no slope TEM, regardless of which unit has Wall Advantage. If squad E is fired on by squad A or F, the -1 for FFMO can be claimed if otherwise applicable. If squad E is fired on by squads A and B (even in conjunction with [an]other firer[s] in J13/J14/K13) as a FG, squad E can claim slope TEM (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">A.5</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="2.42"></a><img src="firelane2.gif" width="61" height="62" alt="FIRELANE2" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.42 FIRE-LANE DRM:</span> Infantry being attacked by a Fire Lane receives a +1 Fire Lane slope DRM if the firer is Up-Slope from, ¾ of a level higher than, and not adjacent to, that target <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if the Infantry is attacked by a Fire Lane Snap Shot (<a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.221" class="topiclink">A9.221</a>), the DRM applies only if these three conditions apply to each of the two hexes that form the Snap Shot hexside, as determined by the firer's separate LOS to each of them]</span>. An Up-Slope attacker's Fire Lane cannot affect a target that lies at a different Base Level (see <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">2.3</a>) from that of the attacker.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="p23.jpg" width="529" height="470" alt="p23" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">2.3</a> illustration, and assume that squads A and B each have a MG. If squad A places a Fire Lane counter in hex L13 (or beyond L13 along that same LOF), all moving Infantry in I13, J13, K13 (or I14, J13, K14; <a href="cha_cha9.htm#9.221" class="topiclink">A9.221</a>) and L13 can be attacked by that Fire Lane with no slope DRM (since squad A is not Up-Slope from any of those Locations). If squad B places a Fire Lane counter in K14, all moving Infantry in J13 (or J14) can be attacked by that Fire Lane with no slope DRM (since those hexes are adjacent to the firer), but moving Infantry in K14 could claim both the slope TEM (<a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.41" class="topiclink">2.41</a>) and slope DRM. If that Fire Lane counter were instead placed beyond K14 along that same LOF (e.g., in M14), moving Infantry in J13 (or J14) and K14 would be affected no differently while moving Infantry in L13 (or L14) would be attacked with no slope DRM (note that I14 is not Up-Slope from L13 and L14 along squad B's individual LOS to each of those two hexes), nor (for the same reason) would the slope DRM apply to Infantry attacked by a Fire Lane Snap Shot at hexside L13-L14. If squad B places a Fire Lane counter in I12 (or beyond I12 along that same LOF), moving Infantry in I12 and I13 could be attacked by that Fire Lane, but those in I12 would receive the slope DRM.</span></p>
<p><a id="2.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.5 ENTRY:</span> A unit crossing a slope hexside that it is Down-Slope from is moving Up-Slope. A unit crossing a slope hexside that it is Up-Slope from is moving Down-Slope.</p>
<p><a id="2.51"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.51 MF COST/BONUS:</span> Infantry/Cavalry (or a Wagon) must expend ½ MF + COT in order to move Up-Slope. Infantry on skis would receive a ½-MF bonus for each Down-Slope hexside they cross (cumulative with any bonus received for moving to a lower elevation). Crossing a slope hexside while moving on a road does not negate the <a href="chb_chb3.htm#3.4" class="topiclink">B3.4</a> MF road bonus.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="p23.jpg" width="529" height="470" alt="p23" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: See the illustration. Squad A must expend 2½ MF to enter hex I14 (1 [COT] + 1 [crossing a barbed-wire-fence hexside; <a href="chp_chp3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">3.2</a>] + ½ [moving Up-Slope] = 2½): if it were also crossing a Crest Line to Level 4, the cost would be 3½ MF ({1 [COT] x 2 [ascending across a Crest Line]) + 1 [crossing a barbed-wire-fence hexside; <a href="chp_chp3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">3.2</a>] + ½ [moving Up-Slope] = 3½). Squad A would expend 2½ MF to enter graveyard hex H14. Squad B would expend one MF to enter J13, since there is no additional cost to move Down-Slope.</span></p>
