For LOS and movement purposes, the roadblock is considered to extend from center dot to center dot of the two hexes formed by that hexside. A Narrow Street roadblock cannot convey Wall Advantage, provides no TEM vs Indirect Fire or Residual FP, and prohibits VBM along the straddled hexside. As a non-Bypassing unit crosses a hexside that is straddled by a Narrow Street roadblock, it must declare a vertex of that hexside in order to establish, vs any ensuing Snap Shot, which &quot;side&quot; of the roadblock it is on (thus determining whether it will be able to claim the roadblock's protective benefits vs that attack).</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="p5141ex.jpg" width="354" height="314" alt="p5141ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: A roadblock has been placed in hexes StO17-O18, with its arrow pointing toward the O17-O18-P17 vertex. Since the roadblock is considered to extend from the center dot of O17 to the center dot of O18, squads F and G have no LOS to each other (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.2" class="topiclink">B9.2</a>), and squad H can claim neither roadblock TEM nor Wall Advantage if fired on by squad F. Squad G must also expend one MF to cross the roadblock if it Bypasses direcdy to vertex O17-O18-P17 (the two MF being expended simultaneously).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad H may enter O17 (whether entering or Bypassing the building) without the roadblock affecting its entry cost. If it directly enters building O17, its owner must declare if it crossed the hexside on the vertex O17-O18-P17 or O17-O18-N17 side of the roadblock; if he chooses the latter, an ensuing Snap Shot conducted by squad F (or by any other unit—including one in Bypass at vertex O17-O18-P17—whose LOS to vertex O17-O18-N17 first crosses the roadblock) will be subject to the roadblock's TEM. If squad H instead enters O17 by Bypassing along Narrow Street hexside O17-N17, each ensuing attack vs it [EXC: Indirect Fire] at vertex O17-O18-N17 by any unit whose LOS to that vertex first crosses the roadblock will likewise be subject to roadblock TEM. </span></p>

<p><a id="5.1411"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.1411 REMOVAL: </span>Clearance attempts vs a Narrow Street roadblock can be made only from any of the four ground-level Locations that touch the straddled hexside. A unit wishing to use a DC to eliminate a Narrow Street roadblock must occupy one of the three hexes that form a vertex of the straddled hexside, and must declare the attempt to eliminate it. The DC is then Placed/Thrown/Set vs that vertex, and can affect nothing but the roadblock when it detonates. Direct Fire ordnance can eliminate a Narrow Street roadblock only if the firer has a LOS to the entire straddled hexside and declares the roadblock as its sole target prior to firing; the attack can affect nothing but the roadblock. Indirect Fire HE eliminates a Narrow Street roadblock with the proper result vs either of the two ground-level Locations that form the straddled hexside. <a href="chb_chb29.htm#29.5" class="topiclink">B29.5</a> applies otherwise unchanged.</p>

The removal of such revealed mines as per <a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.53" class="topiclink">B28.53</a> is NA. Mines in either of the two hexes common to a Narrow Street hexside (or in both such hexes, if one contains A-P mines and the other A-T mines) can possibly affect a unit using Bypass along that hexside; however, if each such hex contains mines of the same type but of a different strength from that in the other Location, only the higher strength can be used to attack the Bypassing unit. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC to both: If that hexside is also a Crest Line hexside, only the mines in the lower-Base-Level hex are used.]</span></p>

A unit Bypassing along the N17-O18 Narrow Street hexside would undergo the eight-FP attack of the O18 minefield.
