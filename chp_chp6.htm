Examples of Hillside hedges are SLX32-Y32 and ChK2-K3; an example of a Hillside wall is StS17-T16. All normal wall/hedge rules apply to Hillside wall/hedges except as modified herein.</p>
<p><a id="6.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.2 LOS:</span> A Hillside wall/hedge (including both its depiction and its associated hexside; <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.1" class="topiclink">B9.1</a>) is ignored when determining whether or not a LOS exists between units whose elevations differ by ≥ one full level <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a unit entrenched behind a Hillside wall/hedge still has its LOS restricted as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>]</span>. It is likewise ignored when determining the number of Blind Hexes created by a Crest Line. If a hill Crest Line ends at a Hillside wall/hedge, the line along which the hill depiction meets the wall/hedge depiction is considered to be the actual Crest Line.</p>

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad A (whose Base-Level elevation is Level 2) has a LOS to squads B, C, D, F, G and I. If squad A were entrenched, it would have a LOS to all squads except B, C, D, E and H.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad B (at Level 1) has a LOS to all squads except G (since G is not Up-Slope across hexside T12-T13).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad C has a LOS to all squads except H and I.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad D has a LOS to all squads except G.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad E has a LOS to all squads except A and G.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad F has a LOS to all squads. If entrenched, it would have a LOS to all squads except B, D and H.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad G has a LOS to squads A, C, F and I.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad H has a LOS to squads B, D, E, F and I.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad I has a LOS to all squads except C (since squad I is not Up-Slope across hexside T12-U13). </span></p>
<p><a id="6.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.3 ELEVATION, TEM &amp; WALL ADVANTAGE:</span> A Hillside wall/hedge is always at the higher of the two Base Levels it lies between, and is treated as a normal wall/hedge when calculating the TEM of targets at ≥ the wall/hedge's base elevation. However, a unit at any level lower than that on which a Hillside wall/hedge sits never receives any benefit (including Wall Advantage; <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.32" class="topiclink">B9.32</a>) from that wall/hedge hexside. A unit in Crest status may claim Wall Advantage over a Hillside wall/hedge that forms a hexside of that unit's hex only if both are at the same elevation and on the same side of the Depression. Otherwise, a unit's inability to claim Wall Advantage over a Hillside wall/hedge hexside does not prevent it from claiming Wall Advantage over another wall/hedge hexside, provided the unit meets all the other <a href="chb_chb9.htm" class="topiclink">B9</a> criteria for doing so.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: See the <a href="chp_chp6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">6.2</a> illustration. Only squad F can claim Wall Advantage across hillside hedges T12-S12/T12-T11. Furthermore, squads C and E can never receive any benefit from the hillside hedges along hexsides(s) of their hexes, as the units are both lower than those hedges.</span></p>
