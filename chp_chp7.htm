<p><a id="7.1"></a><img src="minefield.gif" width="56" height="55" alt="MINEFIELD" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><img src="minefield6.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="MINEFIELD6" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7.1</span> Special minefield counters have been included in KGP. These are termed Known Minefield<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chp_chpfootnotes.htm#10" class="topiclink">10</a></span> counters, and are treated as normal mines except as specified otherwise. &nbsp;Known Minefield counters have the normal depiction on the front but list no attack strength; the reverse side is the same but with the strength shown. When Known minefields are called for in any scenario (or RePh; <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6073" class="topiclink">8.6073</a>), the owner places the desired number of these counters onboard (with the strength-side down). Once the strength of such a counter has been revealed, it is flipped over. Known Minefield counters may represent minefields previously discovered by reconnaissance or in a previous engagement; therefore, Known minefields are set up onboard even in night scenarios. If a Known Minefield counter has its strength reduced or eliminated by OBA/bomb attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">B28.62</a>), that counter is replaced by one having the appropriate new strength (or by a Dummy Minefield counter [<a href="chp_chp7.htm#7.2" class="topiclink">7.2</a>] if its strength was eliminated); if its strength was unrevealed at the time, its new strength remains unrevealed.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A player whose OB contains 24 Known minefield factors may set up two Known Minefield counters with 12 factors each, or three with 8 factors each, or four with 6 factors each, or two with 6 factors each plus one with 12 factors, etc.</span></p>
<p><a id="7.2"></a><img src="dummyminefield.gif" width="113" height="59" alt="dummyminefield" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">7.2 DUMMY MINEFIELDS: </span> Some Known Minefield counters have &quot;Dummy&quot; printed on their reverse side in lieu of a FP factor, thus representing Dummy minefields. When the opponent discovers that it is a Dummy (which must be announced when any ground unit enters, or successfully Searches [<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.152" class="topiclink">A12.152</a>], its Location), simply remove it from play. A Dummy minefield is unaffected by a K/KIA resulting from a bomb/OBA attack (<a href="chb_chb28.htm#28.62" class="topiclink">B28.62</a>). The number that may appear beneath a Dummy Minefield counter depiction in a printed scenario OB represents the number of Dummy counters allotted. In a scenario that does not allot Dummy minefields (which includes all CG scenarios), a player may add (at no extra FPP cost) one Dummy Minefield counter to his OB for every 24 Known minefield factors he sets up. In addition, in any scenario in which a player has received ≥ one Dummy Minefield counter, he may make a Secret dr (halved; FRD) and receives an additional number of Dummy mine counters equal to the result.</p>
<p><a id="7.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.3 HIDDEN MINES:</span> Known Minefield counters may also be used to mark hexes containing hidden mines whose presence (but not strength) is discovered either by Searching (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.152" class="topiclink">A12.152</a>) or by a unit's being subjected to a mine attack DR therein. In addition, any &quot;normal&quot; Minefield counter (i.e., one of the types covered in Section <a href="chb_chb28.htm" class="topiclink">B28</a>) is considered to indicate the presence of Known mines when placed onboard. Normal mines may not be otherwise exchanged for or converted to Known mines <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6073" class="topiclink">8.6073</a>]</span>.</p>
