<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1. <a href="chp_chp1.htm#1.1" class="topiclink">1.1 PINE WOODS:</a></span> The KGP pine woods represents old stands of conifers, where many boughs are above &quot;head&quot; level and in which undergrowth is reduced by the limited amount of sunlight able to filter down to the forest floor.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2. <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.1" class="topiclink">2.1 SLOPE HEXSIDES:</a></span> The normal ASL hill rules, having been composed for the smaller hills depicted on the standard 8&quot;x22&quot; mapboards, do not portray the very large KGP hills realistically in the sense that the per-level width between Crest Lines effectively creates a series of plateaus (or wide terraces) that greatly restrict LOS between different levels. Slopes were devised primarily to alleviate this plateau/terraced-hillside effect</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3. <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">2.3 SLOPE LOS &amp; ELEVATION ADVANTAGE:</a> </span>Giving an Up-Slope unit a ¾-level elevation advantage may seem overly complicated, but it in effect allows the unit to see over half-level—yet not over full-level—obstacles/Hindrances rising from the same Base Level as that unit The &quot;half-level&quot; Hindrances referred to are brush, bridge, grain, marsh, crag and AFV/wrecks.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4. <a href="chp_chp2.htm#2.53" class="topiclink">2.53 CREST-LINE SLOPES:</a></span> The presence of a slope along a Crest-Line hexside sometimes also represents an embankment. These often occurred along the roads, some of which were cut far enough into the hillside that the high-side embankment completely blocked vehicular movement. Since the two embankments along the opposite sides of such a road usually differed significantly in height/steepness, it could not be considered a true sunken road.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5. <a href="chp_chp3.htm#3.1" class="topiclink">3.1 BARBED WIRE FENCES:</a></span> Farmers' barbed-wire fences so criss-crossed some of the areas depicted on the KGP maps that they had a definite impact on the outcome of several battles. In game terms, it was decided early on to prohibit the elimination of barbed-wire-fence hexsides simply be cause otherwise the maps would quickly become cluttered with the dozens of counters that would be needed to mark such hexsides.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6. <a href="chp_chp4.htm#4.2" class="topiclink">4.2 STREAM CULVERT:</a></span> The Stream Culvert represents a three- to five-foot-wide pipe beneath the road, providing an underground passageway for the stream. Its small size and the continuous presence of cold water in it should make the reasoning behind its many game restrictions and penalties self-evident.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7. <a href="chp_chp5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1 NARROW STREETS:</a></span> The local villages and hamlets had quite a number of narrow streets, which are represented on the KGP maps by &quot;hexside roads&quot;. Such streets were notorious for restricting the maneuverability of even average-size vehicles.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">8. <a href="chp_chp5.htm#5.11" class="topiclink">5.11 ONE-LANE:</a></span> Here &quot;road&quot; is defined to mean a string of ≥ one contiguous Narrow Street hexside between the two vertices/hexsides where that string either ends (EX: vertex StO18-O19-N18), joins with two other Narrow Street hexsides (EX: vertex O17-O18-N17), or becomes a non-hexside road (EX: vertex P17-O18-O17). Hence, each of the following constitutes a separate &quot;road&quot; for one-lane purposes: hexsides N17-O18 and N18-O18; hexside N17-O17; hexside O17-O18; hexsides N16-O16 and N16-017; hexsides N15-O15 and N15-O16; hexside N15-N16 to hexside L15-M15 (inclusive); hexside N16-N17 to hexside J18-K19 (inclusive); hexside J18-J19; hexside I19-K19—and so on.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">9. <a href="chp_chp5.htm#5.11" class="topiclink">5.11 DASHING/ROUTING:</a></span> Dashing across/along a Narrow Street is NA mainly to prevent any conflict between the rules for First Fire vs a Dashing unit and those for Snap Shots. Routing along a Narrow Street is NA because a routing unit may not Bypass (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">A4.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">10. <a href="chp_chp6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1 HILLSIDE WALLS &amp; HEDGES;</a> &amp; <a href="chp_chp7.htm#7.1" class="topiclink">7.1 KNOWN MINEFIELDS:</a> </span>These are essentially reprints of the Hillside Walls &amp; Hedges (<a href="chf_chf10.htm" class="topiclink">F10.</a>) and Known Minefield (<a href="chf_chfintro.htm#.7" class="topiclink">F.7-.7C</a>) rules in WEST OF ALAMEIN. They are reprinted (and Known Minefield counters are provided) in KGP I so that WOA need not be a prerequisite for this module.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">8.2 MAP GROUP:</a></span> Phrases like &quot;per Map Group&quot; and &quot;of that Map Group&quot; might be construed to imply that &gt; one Map Group is being used. This is, of course, not true for CG I-III, but such phrases have been left in the body of the rules in case another CG using all the Map Groups appears in some future edition of the ASL Annual.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">12. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#cg6" class="topiclink">8.4 SSR CG6c ELIGIBILITY:</a></span> If the Germans have no Eligible Entry Area on the &quot;St&quot; or &quot;Ch&quot; Map Group, newly purchased German RG must enter from off-map (representing a relief force attempting to break through to their isolated compatriots). If the same situation occurs on the &quot;Lg&quot; Map Group, newly purchased German RG are instead added directly to a friendly Setup Area (representing units that were already in the pocket but not yet committed to the battle).</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">13. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#cg20" class="topiclink">8.4 SSR CG20 VIADUCT ENTRY AREA:</a></span> Vehicles are prohibited from using this Entry Area on the northern edge of the &quot;Ch&quot; map due to the presence (just off-map) of a very steep embankment beside a set of railroad tracks which cross the Ambleve via a narrow viaduct. Infantry were able to traverse the viaduct and embankment with no problem.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><span class="f_Strong">14. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.602" class="topiclink">8.602g MARKER REMOVAL:</a> </span>Each unit still hidden at scenario end is placed on-map concealed (in its respective setup Location) so that it cannot &quot;magically&quot; escape from an Isolated Area, and for use in determining Controlled Strategic Locations. As a house rule, such a unit could be kept off-map unless in danger of being Isolated or needed to verify Control of Strategic Terrain. However, if such a unit's Location is later determined to be Isolated or part of an enemy Setup Area, it must immediately be placed on-map concealed in that Location.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><span class="f_Strong">15. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6044" class="topiclink">8.6044 BOGGED:</a> </span>Each bogged, non-captured U.S.-color vehicle receives a -1 drm to reflect the greater chance of support being available to aid in its unbogging—and also to help minimize the possible U.S. &quot;sleaze tactic&quot; of intentionally trying to bog a vehicle in the hope that it will become Immobilized, thus forming a Strategic Location.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><span class="f_Strong">16. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.608" class="topiclink">8.608 PRISONERS:</a></span> Prisoners are actually being withdrawn to a holding area. Historically, the Germans kept the U.S. POWs they had captured in Stoumont (as well as all German wounded) at the Chateau de Froidcour. When the chateau was abandoned during the night of 21-22 December, most able-bodied prisoners and the German walking wounded were taken to La Gleize; severely wounded men remained at the chateau in the care of two U.S. medics and a German doctor.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><span class="f_Strong">17. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6112" class="topiclink">8.6112 CREW COMBINING</a>:</span> The German side, especially, tends to accumulate &quot;dismounted&quot; vehicle-crews, due in part to less-important Mobile vehicles (e.g., halftracks) being abandoned in order to enable the refuelling of more valuable Out-of-Gas vehicles. Frequently such a crew has also been previously stunned, leaving it marked with a &quot;+#&quot;(Stun) counter when it is not Inherent (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.34" class="topiclink">D5.34</a>). Even though this counter imparts no penalty to the vehicle-crew counter, it does represent the wounding, incapacitation or death of one or more crewmen. This rule represents the combining of two such crews into one &quot;full&quot; one.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><span class="f_Strong">18. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6131" class="topiclink">8.6131 VACATED SETUP AREA:</a></span> Due to the normally limited visibility conditions, the enemy is assumed not to notice that all friendly units have vacated their positions.</p>
<p><a id="19"></a><span class="f_Strong">19. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6141" class="topiclink">8.6141c U.S. M10 &amp; GERMAN SPW 234/2:</a> </span>The special restrictions on siphoning gas from and refuelling M10 TD and SPW 234/2 arise from the fact that, unlike all other vehicles used in KGP, these two required diesel fuel (see <a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#23" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 23</a> and <a href="chh_germannotes_chhgermanvehiclenotes.htm#75" class="topiclink">German Vehicle Note 75</a>).</p>
<p><a id="20"></a><span class="f_Strong">20. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6141" class="topiclink">8.6141c GERMAN REFUELLING dr:</a></span> This represents the fuel obtained from a Luftwaffe air drop made on the evening of the 22nd.</p>
<p><a id="21"></a><span class="f_Strong">21. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.617" class="topiclink">8.617 HISTORICAL WEATHER:</a></span> During the KGP playtest the most commonly asked question about the CG weather was, &quot;Where's the snow?'. The answer is that during the period 19-23 December there was none to speak of in the area depicted by the maps. This was due to a thaw that began on 18 December, melting the snow and turning the frozen ground soggy. For several days thereafter, dense mist blanketed the wet battlefield. Gradually it began to thin out (particularly in the afternoons), and on the morning of 22 December an alternating mixture of rain and snow fell. Then, on the night of 22-23 December, a &quot;Russian high&quot; moved in from the east, bringing freezing temperatures, clear skies, and a breeze that dispersed the last of the mist. The temperature was not to rise above freezing again for weeks—and 29 December would bring blizzards and arctic winds.</p>
<p><a id="22"></a><span class="f_Strong">22. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.619" class="topiclink">8.619 RG COUNTERMIX UNITS:</a> </span>Normal countermix limits do not apply to RG purchases (including any associated Availability DR for optional armament; <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">H1.41</a>). Players should agree on the substitution of other types for those lacking—or purchase more countersheets.</p>
<p><a id="23"></a><span class="f_Strong">23. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6192" class="topiclink">U.S. REINFORCEMENT GROUP CHART footnote &quot;g&quot; M12 GMC OBA:</a></span> On 21 December a lone M12 Gun Motor Carriage (<a href="chh_usnotes_chhamericanvehiclenotes.htm#45" class="topiclink">U.S. Vehicle Note 45</a>) appeared at Targnon (off-map to the west of the &quot;St&quot; Map Group) and positioned itself there to fire into Stoumont. After Peiper withdrew to La Gleize the M12 moved to the Chateau de Froidcour, from where it plastered La Gleize with 196 155mm rounds on 23 December.</p>
<p><a id="24"></a><span class="f_Strong">24. <a href="chp_chpkgpssr.htm#ssr13" class="topiclink">SSR KGP13 GERMAN FUEL SHORTAGE:</a></span> Some playtesters disliked the &quot;abruptness&quot; with which German vehicles run out of gas, and wondered why its occurrence couldn't be preceded by a &quot;low fuel&quot; status similar to the way Low Ammo (<a href="chd_chd3.htm#3.71" class="topiclink">D3.71</a>) works. The reasoning behind the present rule is that, historically, Peiper's vehicles were already low on fuel by the 19th, and by the 20th the situation was becoming critical. Hence in game terms players might visualize each German vehicle's fuel gauge as being almost on &quot;Empty&quot; on the 19th, and on or below the Empty mark after the 21st</p>
<p><a id="25"></a><span class="f_Strong">25. <a href="chp_chpkgpssr.htm#ssr13" class="topiclink">SSR KGP13 TCA-CHANGE DRM:</a> </span>This extra DRM represents the fact that, when the AFV was out of fuel, the turret's electric/hydraulic power-traverse system was inoperable. Hence when the gunner traversed the turret he had to do so manually, using a handwheel —a significantly slower (and more fatiguing) method.</p>
<p><a id="26"></a><span class="f_Strong">26. <a href="chp_chpkgpssr.htm#ssr15" class="topiclink">SSR KGP15 U.S. PF:</a></span> The 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment had captured an entire truckload of PF in Holland. The firing instructions were translated and disseminated to the men, who then underwent training in the use of the weapon.</p>
<p><a id="27"></a><span class="f_Strong">27. <a href="chp_chp8.htm#8.6192" class="topiclink">8.619 U.S. REINFORCEMENT GROUP CHART; G5 AA SECT; M4 18-Ton High Speed Tractor:</a></span> During the war, the U.S. Army desired to have all artillery towed by purpose-built, fully-tracked vehicles, but their supply could never meet the demand. One of the more commonly used types was the M4 18-Ton High-Speed Tractor, which was designed and produced by Allis-Chalmers. Entering production in late 1942, it was used for towing the 3-in. or 90mm AA gun, or (with different ammunition racks and a small swing crane at the rear) the 155mm gun, 8-in. howitzer. The M4 utilized chassis components of the obsolete M2A1 Medium Tank, and was powered by a Waukesha 6-cylinder gasoline engine.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Footnote P27 The US M4 18-Ton High Speed Tractor provided in KGPII should have a 4FP AAMG using the 12.7mm To Kill number with “2” ROF as per&nbsp;<a href="chh_usnotes_chhmultiamivehnotes.htm#o" class="topiclink">U.S. Multi-Applicable Vehicle Note O</a>. Revised counters for these and other counters from KGPII are included in Doomed Battalions. &nbsp;[Counters replaced in DB, and replacements replaced in ABTF]</span></p>
<p>[IMPORTANT: Note the existence of a Level 8 Crest line in &quot;St&quot; hexrows TT28-OO31-MM30-JJ31-JJ32-II33-II34-HH34-HH37-GG38-GG40-HH40-HH47-II48-II54-JJ54-JJ56. Also, the level 3 Crest Line in StM49 runs into hexes M50 and N50, and thence off-map along the south side of unpaved road N51-O57.</p>
