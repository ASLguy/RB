<p><a id="2.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.1</span> &nbsp;Partial Orchards allow for tree-lined roads (akin to <a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.6" class="topiclink">B14.6</a>) to exist, but with the trees on only one side of the road.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chq_chqfootnotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">3</a></span> &nbsp;Any whole hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a whole hex created by butting two mapboards together]</span> containing only two round, green orchard symbols is a Partial Orchard hex. Hex DD17 is an example of a Partial Orchard hex. &nbsp; All rules pertaining to orchards apply to Partial Orchards unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><a id="2.2"></a><img src="q221ex.gif" width="296" height="358" alt="q221ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">2.2 &nbsp;LOS:</span> &nbsp;The orchard obstacle/hindrance of a Partial Orchard hex is not Inherent Terrain. &nbsp; A Partial Orchard's effect on LOS/LOF is determined by which of the Partial Orchard's hexsides/vertices are crossed by that LOS/LOF. &nbsp;The three contiguous hexsides closest to the hex's orchard symbols (including the two vertices joining them together) are termed Orchard Hexsides; the three hexsides farthest from the hex's orchard symbols (including their four vertices) are termed Open Ground Hexsides. If a LOS crosses one or more of the Partial Orchard hex's Orchard Hexsides, that hex is treated as an orchard hex; for LOS crossing only one or more Open Ground Hexsides, that hex<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chq_chqfootnotes.htm#4" class="topiclink">4</a></span> is treated as an Open Ground hex.</p>
<p><a id="2.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.21</span> Since Partial Orchard hexes are not Inherent Terrain, the orchard obstacle/hindrance in them is treated as Inherent Terrain for LOS along a hexside that is common to two Partial Orchard hexes only if that hexside is an Orchard Hexside for both of those hexes.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Squad A's LOS to G is subject to a +1 orchard hindrance (and vice versa), as is the LOS between Squads B and E. Squad A's LOS to 1 is subject to a +2 orchard hindrance because both Partial Orchard hexes along that LOS are considered to be orchard hexes for that LOS. Since Partial Orchard hexes are not Inherent Terrain, Squad C has an unhindered LOS to F and H. Additionally, because the vertices formed where a Partial Orchard hex's Open Ground Hexsides and its Orchard Hexsides meet are Open Ground, Squad D's LOS to G is unhindered. As per <a href="chq_chq2.htm#2.21" class="topiclink">2.21</a>, there is a +1 orchard hindrance for LOS between Squads B and I. See also the <a href="chq_chq8.htm#8.3" class="topiclink">8.3</a> example.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: As Squad H enters N21 (without expending 1 MF to enter the Irrigation Ditch), it is subject to FFMO for fire from Squads A, B, and D only.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Assuming Mud is in effect, Squad I could expend 1½ MF to enter hex O22 (considered Open Ground for the move), while Squad B would expend only 1 MF to cross the Orchard Hexside into the same hex. </span></p>
<p><a id="2.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.3 &nbsp;MOVEMENT:</span> For movement purposes when entering a Partial Orchard hex, units are considered to be entering an Orchard hex if they cross an Orchard Hexside, and entering an Open Ground hex if they cross an Open Ground hexside <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: &nbsp;OBA, Residual FP and TPBF are resolved as though any target was entering an Open Ground hex regardless of hexside crossed]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="2.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.31 &nbsp;RIDERS:</span> AFV Riders may only enter/exit a Partial Orchard hex across an Open Ground hexside (<a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">D6.2-.21</a>).</p>
<p><a id="2.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.4 </span> Partial Orchard hexes are not considered Concealment Terrain for any purpose.</p>
<p><a id="2.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">2.5 &nbsp;AERIAL:</span> An in-season Partial Orchard hex is considered an in-season orchard hex for Sighting TC (<a href="che_che3.htm#3.7" class="topiclink">E3.7</a>) purposes <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a target in an in-season Partial Orchard hex receives only a +1 DRM if the aircraft counter's Attack Position is predesignated as entering the target hex through an Open Ground hexside]</span>. A glider landing in a Partial Orchard hex receives a +1 Crash drm, but only if landing across an Orchard hexside.</p>
