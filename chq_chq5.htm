<p><a id="5.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.1 TERRAIN COMBINATIONS:</span> Some hexes on the PB map contain combinations of two terrain types that are not normally found in the same hex. For these combinations, all rules for both individual terrain types apply normally. (The terrain effects of both terrain types are cumulative as per <a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.1" class="topiclink">B.1</a>.) The existing rules for these situations are further clarified below.</p>
<p class="p_Highlight"><span class="f_Highlight">Q5.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How is a gully / irrigation ditch hex (e.g., PB R22) treated?</span></p>
<p class="p_Highlight"><span class="f_Highlight">A. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like a gully hex.</span></p>

<p><a id="5.2"></a><img src="q5a.gif" width="408" height="114" alt="q5a" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5.2 IRRIGATION-DITCH PARTIAL-ORCHARD HEX:</span> A unit that enters an irrigation ditch across an orchard hexside (EX: PBPP16-QQ17) and that pays the additional MF to claim the conditional +1 TEM expends 2 MF to do so. A fully-tracked vehicle entering an irrigation ditch across a non-road orchard hexside pays 3 MP (4 MP for a half-track).</p>
<p><a id="5.3"></a><img src="q5b.gif" width="410" height="127" alt="q5b" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5.3 STREAM-PARTIAL-ORCHARD HEX: </span>A unit enters a stream-partial-orchard hex (EX: PBP17) across a stream hexside at the normal stream cost. If entering across an orchard hexside, movement costs are cumulative (e.g., 4 MF to enter a shallow stream-partial-orchard hex). &nbsp;All rules for Crest Status (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.9" class="topiclink">B20.9</a>) apply in a stream-partial-orchard hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Good Order Infantry may gain Crest status in such an Accessible hex, along the non-stream partial-orchard hexside they cross, at a cost of 2 MF]</span>. The orchard terrain rises (to its normal height) from the Crest level of—not from IN— the stream hex.</p>
<p><a id="5.4"></a><img src="q5c.gif" width="410" height="128" alt="q5c" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5.4 &nbsp;BUILDING-ORCHARDS:</span> The entry COT for a Building-Orchard hex (EX: PBZ14) prior to any further modification for Infantry is 3 MF and that or vehicles is 1 MP plus normal building COT.</p>
<p><a id="5.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.41</span> Units may bypass the building obstacle (unless otherwise prohibited; <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">A4.3</a>, <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">D2.3-.31</a>) by moving through the orchard portion of the building-orchard hex and in such case would not be subject to FFMO.</p>
<p><a id="5.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.42</span> &nbsp;A LOS through a building-orchard hex (i.e., a LOS that is not blocked by the building) is subject to the normal orchard LOS rules (<a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.2" class="topiclink">B14.2-.21</a>).</p>
<p><a id="5.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.43</span> &nbsp;The TEM of a building-orchard hex is +2 or +3 according to the type of building in the hex and it does not apply to a unit in Bypass.</p>
<p><a id="5.44"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.44</span> &nbsp;The Kindling Number of a building-orchard hex is 7 or 8 according to the type of building in the hex; EC DRM do not apply to Kindling attempts. A building-orchard hex's Spreading Fire Number is 9 and EC DRM do apply to the Spreading Fire DR provided that the spreading fire is not from a Flame in that hex, nor from a directly attached building. The -1 DRM for a Fortified Building applies to all Kindling/Spreading-Fire DR if the building Location is fortified.</p>
<p><a id="5.5"></a><img src="q5d.gif" width="410" height="116" alt="q5d" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">5.5 BUILDING-ROAD:</span> &nbsp; Hexes PBW18 and PBX18 are unique in that each contains a building with a road running through the hex.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chq_chqfootnotes.htm#11" class="topiclink">11</a></span> For all purposes, the building is treated as a normal single-story house (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.21" class="topiclink">B23.21</a>) and the road is treated as a Narrow Street (<a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1</a>) that runs along hexsides X18-X19 and W18-W19 <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: The TCA change restrictions of <a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.121" class="topiclink">4.121-.122</a> do not apply; instead, a vehicle using VBM along these Narrow Street hexsides may never have its own hex within its TCA. LOS to units on the road is always traced to its center dot (or as per <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.132" class="topiclink">A4.132</a>), not to its vertex, although the building depiction can block such LOS. &nbsp;Vehicles move directly from hexside X18-X19 to hex PBY18 (and vice versa) and from hexside X18-X19 to hexside W18-W19 (and vice versa)]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="5.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.6 SLOPES &amp; ORCHARDS:</span> Because an Up-Slope unit is treated as being at a different elevation than its Base Level (<a href="chq_chq3.htm#3.3" class="topiclink">3.3</a>), in-season orchards are same-level LOS obstacles to units in hexes with the same Base Levels as those orchards if the unit is Up-Slope to the target.</p>
