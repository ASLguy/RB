<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="6.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.1</span> &nbsp;Towers represent tall, narrow building-like structures that contain an upper level Location with no ground level Tower Location (although the hex contains a Location at ground level).<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chq_chqfootnotes.htm#12" class="topiclink">12</a></span> &nbsp; Towers are represented by an obviously round, single-hex structure containing a white, square stairwell symbol (EX: PBC9). &nbsp; A Tower (but not the ground level Location of its hex) is treated as a wooden building unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p class="p_Highlight"><span class="f_Highlight">Q6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hex C9 should have a square, white staircase symbol indicating it is a Tower.</span></p>
<p><a id="6.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.2</span> &nbsp;The height and LOS charactistics for each Tower are specified by SSR. Towers will be defined by SSR as being either an LOS Obstacle or Hindrance. &nbsp; Each Tower contains only a single Tower Location that exists at a Level above ground level which is specified by SSR; the Tower Obstacle/Hindrance height is ½ Level above the SSR designated Tower Location height.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: An SSR that reads, &quot;Hex PBC9 contains a Tower Hindrance with a Tower Location 1 Level above ground level,&quot; describes a 1½ Level LOS Hindrance.</span></p>
<p><a id="6.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.21 STACKING:</span> The stacking capacity of a Tower hex's ground level Location is unaffected by the presence of the Tower. A Tower Location has a normal stacking limit (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">A5.1</a>) of one HS-equivalent and 5PP. Towers have no Rooftop Locations and may never be fortified.</p>
<p><a id="6.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.3 &nbsp;TEM:</span> &nbsp;A unit at the ground-level Location of a Tower hex is considered to be occupying the other terrain in that hex and so uses the TEM of that other terrain. A Tower Location has a TEM of 0, although units therein are eligible for the +1 Height Advantage TEM. Units entering a Tower hex/Location are never subject to FFMO.</p>
<p><a id="6.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.31 AIR BURSTS:</span> Locations of a Tower that are in a woods hex are subject to Air Burst TEM only if those Locations are not higher than the top-most Level of those woods.</p>
<p><a id="6.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.4 &nbsp;MOVEMENT:</span> The cost for Infantry to enter the ground level of a Tower hex is 1 MF plus COT. &nbsp; Cavalry may only enter a Tower hex using bypass movement. &nbsp;A Gun may neither set up in nor enter, nor may a dm 76-82mm mortar be assembled in, a Tower hex/Location.</p>
<p><a id="6.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.41 </span>Vehicles must use VBM to enter a Tower hex. Fully-tracked, BU, CT, AFV may also enter the Tower obstacle as per <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.41" class="topiclink">B23.41</a> <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a Tower has no cellar and adds an extra -1 drm to the colored dr of the AFV's Bog Check as though the tower was a single story building]</span>. </p>
<p><a id="6.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.42</span> &nbsp;Infantry may move to/from a Tower Location via the Tower's stairwell or by Scaling (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.424" class="topiclink">B23.424</a>). &nbsp;Movement along a stairwell costs 1 MF per Level changed and is subject to movement penalties for Snow. &nbsp;A unit may never end its MPh in an intermediate stairwell Location (i.e., it must end its MPh either in the Tower Location or in the Tower Hex's ground level Location).</p>
<p><a id="6.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.43</span> &nbsp;Infantry moving to/from a Tower Location via the Tower's stairwell may be attacked at ground level (if descending) and/or the Tower Location (if ascending) in the normal manner. &nbsp; If there is a second-level Location, however, they may also be attacked at the first-level &quot;quasi-Location&quot; of that hex by a unit that has a LOS to that quasi-Location. Such a quasi-Location is not considered Open Ground, but such an attack vs it receives no TEM. The target is assumed to expend one MF per level changed; if pinned or broken while at that quasi-Location it reverts to the level it was attempting to leave (and may be attacked by any Residual FP at that level as it re-enters it). The Residual FP left by an attack vs such a quasi-Location remains at that level (place the Residual FP counter on the appropriate Level counter) to attack each unit subsequently entering that level in that hex during the same MPh.</p>
<p><a id="6.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.5 &nbsp;CONCEALMENT:</span> The other terrain in a Tower hex determines whether or not the ground-level Location of that hex is Concealment Terrain. &nbsp; A Tower Location is treated as a building Rooftop (<a href="chq_chqpbssr.htm#7" class="topiclink">SSR PB7</a>; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.82" class="topiclink">B23.82</a>) for HIP/concealment purposes (only).</p>
<p><a id="6.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.6 ROUT:</span> A Tower hex/Location is not considered a building for rout purposes.</p>
<p><a id="6.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.7</span> &nbsp;The ground level Location of a Tower hex is not considered a building Location for Victory purposes, but any Tower Location is.</p>
