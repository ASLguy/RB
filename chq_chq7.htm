<p><a id="7.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.1</span> A barbed-wire fence is depicted by a series of small black Xs overlaying a hexside (EX: PBS11-T11). Barbed wire is neither an obstacle nor a Hindrance, provides no TEM, does not negate the FFMO/FFNAM DRM, and cannot be Cleared or eliminated in any way.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chq_chqfootnotes.htm#13" class="topiclink">13</a></span></p>
<p><a id="7.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.2 MF COST:</span> Infantry must pay one MF + COT to cross a barbed-wire-fence hexside, unless using Armored Assault or moving within a trench or tunnel (in which case only the COT applies). The cost for Cavalry is two MF + COT. No Wagon, ridden bicycle, Infantry on skis, or currently-CX Infantry/Cavalry/horse may cross a barbed-wire-fence hexside. All barbed-wire-fence hexside MF costs are doubled at night. A Straying unit required, but unable, to cross a barbed-wire-fence hexside becomes TI instead.</p>
<p><a id="7.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.21 TEMPORARY BREACH:</span> A non-Straying, Good Order Infantry MMC neither beneath an Entrenchment/Pillbox nor above a Wire counter may create a temporary breach in one barbed-wire-fence hexside of its hex by expending two MF in its MPh while at ground level in (but not IN) that hex. Place the top edge of the MMC counter over the selected barbed-wire-fence hexside and mark the unit TI. For as long as that MMC remains TI, unpinned, and in Good Order, it is considered to be using Hazardous Movement but that hexside's barbed-wire cost for Infantry <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if broken, berserk, Manhandling, or part of a Human Wave]</span> becomes ½ MF. (A vehicle crossing that hexside would still be subject to Bog as per <a href="chq_chq7.htm#7.3" class="topiclink">7.3</a>, but would not affect that hexside's temporarily-breached status.) Creating a temporary breach in barbed wire is a concealment-loss activity (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.141" class="topiclink">A12.141</a>).</p>
<p><a id="7.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.3 MP COST &amp; BOG:</span> Barbed wire has no effect on MP costs; however, no motorcycle may cross a barbed-wire-fence hexside. Each vehicle that enters a new hex by crossing a barbed-wire-fence hexside must undergo a Bog DR, in addition to any other Bog Check required for entry of the Location. If it Bogs, it is left in the hex it was attempting to enter. (If it Bogs twice, due to both crossing a barbed-wire-fence hexside and other terrain in the hex, mark it with a Mired—not a Bog—counter.) The only DRM that can apply to a barbed-wire Bog Check are:</p>
