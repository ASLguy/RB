<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1. <a href="chq_chq1.htm#1.1" class="topiclink">1.1 IRRIGATION DITCHES:</a> </span>There were many irrigation and drainage ditches in the fields near Pegasus Bridge, varying in size from small ones which would be of little impact in battle to ones almost gully-sized. It was decided early on that a generic representation of the average ditch was required. An average ditch is several feet across, and at least several feet deep, often with small footpaths crossing it. A wheeled vehicle would have little chance of crossing this ditch, while even tracked vehicles could get mired in the larger ditches. Moving infantry could cross this ditch with little or no delay, or they could slosh through it, receiving cover from incoming fire.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2. <a href="chq_chq1.htm#1.43" class="topiclink">1.43 VEHICULAR MOVEMENT THROUGH AN IRRIGATION DITCH:</a></span> &nbsp;During playtesting, a vehicle would often enter an irrigation ditch hex along a road hexside and then exit the hex via a non-road hexside with no penalty. &nbsp;This struck many as incongruous. &nbsp;The solution was to require the MF and Bog penalties for non-road movement to be paid upon either entrance or exit. &nbsp; It didn't seem worthwhile to add another counter just to show whether or not a vehicle had entered an Irrigation Ditch hex via a road, although a side note of this status might be useful if the game is paused.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3.  <a href="chq_chq2.htm#2.1" class="topiclink">2.1 &nbsp;PARTIAL ORCHARDS:</a></span> The roads along the Canal de Caen at Benouville (as well as some of the other roads in the area) had trees lining only one side of the road. &nbsp; The obvious parallel was to the Orchard Road (<a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.6" class="topiclink">B14.6</a>); ultimately, adapting the Orchard rules worked best for simulating this terrain feature. &nbsp; Some thought was given to trying to adapt Hedges (<a href="chb_chb9.htm" class="topiclink">B9.</a>) for this purpose, but that concept didn't work out well.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.  <a href="chq_chq2.htm#2.2" class="topiclink">2.2 LOS:</a></span> &nbsp; The number of hindrances for a sharply angled shot along a road lined with Partial Orchards can seem high, but in reality such a LOS can indeed be blocked. &nbsp; One playtest group suggested that the number of hindrances should equal the number of Partial Orchard hexsides crossed divided by two (FRD). &nbsp; In practice, this seemed more trouble than it was worth, so the simpler method won out. &nbsp; If during play you find the hindrances to be too high, use the above as a house rule for a more intricate simulation.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.  <a href="chq_chq3.htm#3.1" class="topiclink">3.1 SLOPE HEXSIDES</a>, <a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1 VILLAGE TERRAIN</a>, &amp; <a href="chq_chq7.htm#7.1" class="topiclink">7.1 BARBED-WIRE FENCES</a>:</span> &nbsp;These are essentially reprints of the Slope Hexside (<a href="chp_chp2.htm" class="topiclink">P2.</a>), Village Terrain (<a href="chp_chp5.htm" class="topiclink">P5.</a>), and Barbed-Wire Fences (<a href="chp_chp3.htm" class="topiclink">P3.</a>) rules in KAMPFGRUPPE PEIPER. &nbsp; They are reprinted in PB so that KGP need not be a prerequisite for this module. &nbsp;Although PB does not have the wide range of elevations that KGP does, the additional flexibility provided by the slope rules in overcoming the plateau effect made it much easier to represent the actual terrain.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.  <a href="chq_chq3.htm#3.3" class="topiclink">3.3 SLOPE LOS &amp; ELEVATION ADVANTAGE:</a> </span>Giving an Up-Slope unit a ¾-level elevation advantage may seem overly complicated, but it in effect allows the unit to see over half-level-yet not over full-level-obstacles/Hindrances rising from the same Base Level as that unit. The &quot;half-level&quot; Hindrances referred to are brush, bridge, grain, marsh, crag and AFV/wrecks.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.  <a href="chq_chq3.htm#3.53" class="topiclink">3.53 CREST-LINE SLOPES:</a></span> The presence of a slope along a Crest-Line hexside sometimes also represents an embankment. These often occurred along the roads, some of which were cut far enough into the hillside that the high-side embankment completely blocked vehicular movement. Since the two embankments along the opposite sides of such a road usually differed significantly in height/steepness, it could not be considered a true sunken road.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.  <a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1 NARROW STREETS:</a></span> The local villages and hamlets had quite a number of narrow streets, which are represented on the PB map by &quot;hexside roads&quot;. Such streets were notorious for restricting the maneuverability of even average-size vehicles.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.  <a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11 ONE-LANE:</a></span> Here &quot;road&quot; is defined to mean a string of ≥ one contiguous Narrow Street hexside between the two vertices/hexsides where that string either ends (EX: vertex PBDD10-DD11- EE11), joins with two other Narrow Street hexsides (EX: vertex K12-K13-L12), or becomes a non-hexside road (EX: vertex J12-K12-K13). &nbsp;Hence, each of the following constitutes a separate &quot;road&quot; for one-lane purposes: hexsides K9-L9 and K10-L9; hexsides K13-L12 and L13-L12; and single hexsides B16-C16; P12-P13; K12-K13; K12-L12- and so on.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">10.  <a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11 DASHING/ROUTING:</a></span> Dashing across/along a Narrow Street is NA mainly to prevent any conflict between the rules for First Fire vs a Dashing unit and those for Snap Shots. Routing along a Narrow Street is NA because a routing unit may not Bypass (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">A4.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.  <a href="chq_chq5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">5.5 BUILDING-ROAD:</a></span> &nbsp; The Gondree Cafe (hex PBX18) is less than 10 meters from the canal, with the tow-path road running in between. &nbsp; Although the building-road hex was designed reluctantly to simulate this terrain, in practice the concept worked out well.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">12.  <a href="chq_chq6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1 TOWERS:</a></span> &nbsp; The Towers represent the water towers scattered throughout rural France, as well as other types of unenclosed towers and observation platforms. &nbsp;Clock towers and other substantial enclosed structures will be better represented by normal buildings (<a href="chb_chb23.htm" class="topiclink">B23.</a>), perhaps in combination with Steeples (<a href="chq_chq4.htm#4.2" class="topiclink">4.2</a>.) &nbsp;Towers can also be depicted, via an SSR, by on-map buildings. &nbsp; The definition of Towers in these rules was left some what open; the rules were given &quot;plug in&quot; characteristics with the intent that scenario designers adapt them to their own specific situations.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">13.  <a href="chq_chq7.htm" class="topiclink">7.1 BARBED-WIRE FENCES:</a></span> &nbsp; Barbed-wire fences enclosed some of the small fields and orchards depicted on the PB map and, in such areas, had a definite impact on infantry and vehicular movement. &nbsp; In game terms, it was decided not to allow the elimination of barbed-wire-fence hexsides because otherwise the map could become cluttered with the counters needed to mark such hexsides.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><span class="f_Strong">14.  <a href="chq_chq8.htm#8.1" class="topiclink">8.1 HILLSIDE WALLS &amp; HEDGES:</a></span> &nbsp;These are essentially reprints of the Hillside Walls &amp; Hedges (<a href="chf_chf10.htm" class="topiclink">F10.</a>) rules in WEST OF ALAMEIN. They are reprinted here so that only the counters from WOA are a prerequisite for this module.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#cg12" class="topiclink">9.4 CG12 GERMAN PANZERFAUST:</a></span> During the playtest, German players ahistorically overused PF vs Infantry, since they knew the British would receive no armor until late in the CG. &nbsp; Reducing the number of PF available simulates the German Infantry's historical reluctance to use its limited anti-tank resources vs Infantry targets.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#cg13" class="topiclink">9.4 CG13 SNIPERS:</a></span> &nbsp;Sniper fire, especially from the church steeple in Le Port, harassed the British all day long, making control of the steeple a priority for the bridge defenders. This provision also serves as an incentive to the British player not to ignore Le Port until the end-game. &nbsp; Unlike the other HASL modules, PB requires the use of two Sniper counters even though only one map is used. &nbsp;Since the battle tends to break down into two separate conflicts (one for Le Port and one for Benouville), the usually random aspect of Snipers could be manipulated by setting up a solitary Sniper counter so that it never moved too far from one half of the battle. Two randomly activated Sniper counters help remove this control from the players.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><span class="f_Strong">17.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#cg17" class="topiclink">9.4 CG17 &nbsp;WALKING WOUNDED (WW) MMC:</a></span> &nbsp; There were many instances of men from the 7th Battalion or from the Ox and Bucks staying in the fight despite suffering severe wounds; there was no where to retreat to but into the arms of the Germans. &nbsp;Only the most seriously wounded were moved several hundred yards to the rear of the &quot;front lines&quot; to where a surgeon of the Ox and Bucks treated them.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.51" class="topiclink">9.51-.52: &nbsp; PB CAMPAIGN GAME I &amp; PB CAMPAIGN GAME II:</a> </span> The Victory Conditions are designed to prevent the British player from merely huddling around the bridge, while at the same time giving the German player a powerful incentive to take back the bridge from the British. &nbsp;Also, Lord Lovatt's (non-Airborne) commandos were desperately needed in Ranville. Delaying a significant portion of them in Benouville would surely have allowed the 21st Panzer Division to break through in that sector—victory enough for the Germans. &nbsp; Capture of the Orne River Bridge (500 meters east of the canal) was just as important to the Allied effort as Pegasus Bridge, but historically the river bridge fell to the Ox and Bucks without a shot being fired, and no fighting occurred around it. Early renditions of the map included the river bridge, but, unlike the western edge of the map, it never came into play.</p>
<p><a id="19"></a><span class="f_Strong">19.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.52" class="topiclink">9.52 &nbsp; PB CAMPAIGN GAME II:</a> </span> &nbsp;The second CG allows players to enjoy simulating the battle without having to use the night/glider rules. Although almost anything can happen by the time dawn arrives in the first CG, the second represents the rough historical disposition of troops after the Germans withdrew from their night attacks. &nbsp; Players will probably notice that the first CG plays considerably different from this second, as the British losses inflicted by the Germans at night are often much more than occurred historically. A third CG involving only the three night scenarios is in the works and may appear in some future edition of the ASL Annual.</p>
<p><a id="20"></a><span class="f_Strong">20. &nbsp; <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.602" class="topiclink">9.602f MARKER REMOVAL:</a></span> Each unit still hidden at scenario end is placed on-map concealed (in its respective setup Location) so that it cannot &quot;magically&quot; escape from an Isolated Area, and for use in determining Controlled Strategic Locations. As a house rule, such a unit could be kept off-map unless in danger of being Isolated or needed to verify Control of Strategic Terrain. However, if such a unit's Location is later determined to be Isolated or part of an enemy Setup Area, it must immediately be placed on-map concealed in that Location.</p>
<p><a id="21"></a><span class="f_Strong">21.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.6113" class="topiclink">9.6113 BATTLE HARDENING LEADERS:</a></span> &nbsp; Given that the entire &quot;campaign&quot; lasts less than 24 hours, certain features of earlier HASL Campaign Games RED BARRICADES and KGP were not appropriate for PB, e.g., Battle Hardening during the RePh of retained MMC in the absence of a Hero and of non-heroic Leaders, removal of fortifications and wrecks during the RePh, &quot;resupply&quot; of Isolated units during a scenario, provisions for random weather, etc.</p>
<p><a id="22"></a><span class="f_Strong">22.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.6131" class="topiclink">9.6131 VACATED SETUP AREA:</a></span> &nbsp;Due to the confused nature of the battle lines and the short time span represented by the RePh, &nbsp;the enemy is assumed not to have noticed that all friendly units have vacated their positions, or to have been unable to react to the situation.</p>
<p><a id="23"></a><span class="f_Strong">23.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.615" class="topiclink">9.615 OB-GIVEN REINFORCEMENTS:</a></span> In such a short, focused &quot;campaign,&quot; balancing the historical flow of the battle with allowing the British player to choose from Reinforcement Groups just wasn't feasible. &nbsp;The Allied commanders didn't have the luxury of choosing which units to commit to battle or when to do so. Instead of RG, the British receive reinforcements on a set timetable. &nbsp; (Random reinforcements were found to affect play balance too much.) &nbsp; British reinforcements received for Night II represent the rest of the Ox and Bucks who landed at the Orne River bridge; those received for Night III and Dawn represent paratroopers making their way up from the area around Ranville; the Day II reinforcements are Lord Lovatt's commandos, striking towards Ranville to reinforce the paratroopers there; and the Dusk reinforcements are the Royal Warwickshires, attacking from Sword Beach with armor support. &nbsp;See the PB scenarios for more details.</p>
<p><a id="24"></a><span class="f_Strong">24.  <a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.6153" class="topiclink">9.6153 REINFORCEMENT WITHDRAWAL</a></span><a href="chq_chq9.htm#9.6153" class="topiclink">:</a> Lord Lovatt's commandos were desperately needed in Ranville and fought around Pegasus Bridge only long enough to ensure their passage through to the south. Simulating this in the CG was one of the trickier aspects of designing PB. The Sherman DD tank, however, did stay behind at the bridge and fought in Benouville.</p>
<p><a id="25"></a><span class="f_Strong">25. &nbsp; <a href="chq_chqpbssr.htm#6" class="topiclink">SSR PB6 HEDGES:</a></span> The hedges around Benouville verge upon becoming bocage. The Bog Check that all vehicles must take in the hex being exited when crossing a hedge helps simulate this.</p>
<p><a id="26"></a><span class="f_Strong">26. &nbsp; <a href="chq_chqpbssr.htm#14" class="topiclink">SSR PB14 OX AND BUCKS:</a></span> The Ox and Bucks had trained together long hours under Major Howard in preparation for capturing the bridges over the Orne river and the Canal de Caen at Benouville. &nbsp; They practiced night tactics via repeated assaults on mock-ups of the actual terrain and were more familiar with the area around the bridges than were the German defenders-to the point where consideration was given to exempting them from paying the extra MF for Concealment Terrain at night (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.51" class="topiclink">E1.51</a>). This was felt to be too powerful, however, so they were limited to the benefits of being Stealthy at night. They also trained extensively on various German small arms and machine guns and had developed a high regard for the latter. When they captured a cache of ammunition near the bridge, many men dumped their Sten guns for German machine pistols and the sought-after MG34 machine gun.</p>
<p><a id="27"></a><span class="f_Strong">27. &nbsp; <a href="chq_chqpbssr.htm" class="topiclink">SSR PB19 STARSHELLS:</a></span> The German forces were not well-prepared for night combat, while the Ox and Bucks were planning on using the cover of darkness to capture the bridge and Benouville. &nbsp; This is represented by limiting starshell usage to Leaders and AFV. The +2 drm for British leaders represents both the limited resources of the Ox and Bucks and their reluctance to light up the night, as well as helping to offset the higher number of Leaders the British get.</p>
