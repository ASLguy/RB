<p><a id="8.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.1</span> &nbsp;Partial Orchards allow for tree-lined roads (akin to <a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.6" class="topiclink">B14.6</a>) to exist, but with the trees generally on only one side of the road. Any whole hex containing only two round, green orchard symbols is a Partial Orchard hex. Hex M15 is an example of a Partial Orchard hex. All rules pertaining to Orchards apply to Partial Orchards unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><a id="8.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.2 &nbsp;LOS:</span> The orchard obstacle/hindrance of a Partial Orchard hex is not Inherent Terrain. A Partial Orchard's effect on LOS/LOF is determined by which of the Partial Orchard's hexsides/vertices are crossed by that LOS/LOF. The three contiguous hexsides closest to the hex's orchard symbols (including the two vertices joining them together) are termed Orchard Hexsides; the three hexsides farthest from the hex's orchard symbols (including their four vertices) are termed Open Ground Hexsides. If a LOS crosses one or more of the Partial Orchard hex's Orchard Hexsides, that hex is treated as an orchard hex; for LOS crossing only one or more Open Ground Hexsides, that hex is treated as an Open Ground hex.</p>
<p><a id="8.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.21</span> Since Partial Orchard hexes are not Inherent Terrain, the orchard obstacle/hindrance in them is treated as Inherent Terrain for LOS along a hexside that is common to two Partial Orchard hexes only if that hexside is an Orchard Hexside for both of those hexes.</p>
<p><a id="8.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.3 &nbsp;MOVEMENT:</span> For movement purposes when entering a Partial Orchard hex, units are considered to be entering an Orchard hex if they cross an Orchard Hexside, and entering an Open Ground hex if they cross an Open Ground hexside <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: OBA, Residual FP and TPBF are resolved as though any target was entering an Open Ground hex regardless of hexside crossed]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="8.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.31 RIDERS:</span> AFV Riders may only enter/exit a Partial Orchard hex across an Open Ground hexside <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if crossing a road hexside; <a href="chd_chd6.htm#6.21" class="topiclink">D6.21</a>].</span></p>
<p><a id="8.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.4</span> &nbsp;Partial Orchard hexes are not considered Concealment Terrain for any purpose.</p>
