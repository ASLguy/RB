<p>Unless specified otherwise, ABtF SSR apply to all ABtF scenarios—both CG and non-CG type.</p>
<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF1 CONCEALMENT:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chr_chrfootnotes.htm#19" class="topiclink">19</a></span> Regardless of LOS, British units setting up in Concealment Terrain may always begin the game concealed (before the German player may look at the board). British OB (or purchased) concealment counters are intended for use as Dummies (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.11" class="topiclink">A12.11</a>).</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF2 CLOAKING:</span> During Night Scenarios, the Scenario Attacker uses Cloaking (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.4" class="topiclink">E1.4</a>) for all units even if some/all of those units set up on map. Majority Squad Type for the Germans is always Lax. Majority Squad Type for the British is always Stealthy. On-map Cloaked SW need not be dm.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF3 PIATS:</span> At the start of play, the British Player may secretly record which units possess his available (by OB, or Retained; <a href="chr_chr9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">R9.4</a>, <a href="chr_chr9.htm#cg10" class="topiclink">SSR CG10</a>) PIATs. The presence of these PIATs must be revealed when the possessing unit is no longer Good Order or if it performs any of the following actions in LOS and within 16 hexes of an unbroken enemy unit: fires the PIAT, transfers the PIAT to another unit, or drops possession of the PIAT (even if subsequently Recovered). Once revealed, PIATs may not regain &quot;hidden&quot; status in the current scenario.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF4 NO QUARTER:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chr_chrfootnotes.htm#20" class="topiclink">20</a></span> No Quarter (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.3" class="topiclink">A20.3</a>) is in effect for both sides <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: units about to be eliminated for Failure to Rout will instead surrender to any ADJACENT, armed, Known enemy Infantry unit. Surrender may be refused (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.3" class="topiclink">A20.3</a>) only if all eligible captors already possess the maximum number of prisoners they can Guard (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.51" class="topiclink">A20.51</a>)]</span>. Massacres (<a href="cha_cha20.htm#20.4" class="topiclink">A20.4</a>) are NA.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF5 NARROW STREETS:</span> Due to the relatively narrow streets in the majority of the town proper, all fire attacks vs Dashing Infantry (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.63" class="topiclink">A4.63</a>) receive a cumulative +1 DRM (treated as an LV hindrance) when fired upon in the road Location. Such DRM ceases the instant Dash benefits become NA (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.63" class="topiclink">A4.63</a>).</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF6 GAMMON BOMBS:</span> All British Infantry units may roll for ATMM (<a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.7" class="topiclink">C13.7</a>) as if they were 1944 German Infantry <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a successful placement attempt results in a -2 CC Attack DRM (vice -3 for &quot;normal&quot; ATMM)]</span>. SMC receive a +2 drm to their ATMM Check dr. Walking Wounded MMC receive a +1 ATMM Check drm while Assault Engineer and Commando MMC receive a -1 drm to their ATMM Check dr.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF7 INTERROGATION:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chr_chrfootnotes.htm#21" class="topiclink">21</a></span> Civilian Interrogation (<a href="che_che2.htm" class="topiclink">E2</a>) is in effect for both sides. Both sides are considered to be in a neutral country.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF8 FANATICISM:</span> All British units are Fanatic (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.8" class="topiclink">A10.8</a>) in Building S11 (The Schoolhouse). See also <a href="chr_chr9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">9.4</a>, <a href="chr_chr9.htm#cg23" class="topiclink">SSR CG23</a>.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF9 STEALTH:</span> Elite British units are Stealthy. All German MMC are Lax at night.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF10 HAND-TO-HAND:</span> Hand-to-Hand CC (<a href="chj_chapj.htm#2.31" class="topiclink">J2.31</a>) may be declared by both sides. Additionally, the DEFENDER may declare Hand-to-Hand CC provided all ATTACKER units were Ambushed or are Withdrawing/pinned. Hand-to-Hand CC By/vs PRC/vehicle(s)/pillbox-occupant(s) is NA.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF11 ROOFTOPS:</span> Rooftops (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.8" class="topiclink">B23.8</a>) are in effect. Control of a Rooftop Location never counts as Control of a building Location.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF12 OFF-MAP ROADS:</span> Any road that exits the-map (i.e., to beyond the printed mapsheet area) is considered for the purposes of <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">A2.51</a> to extend beyond that map edge either along the same lettered hexrow, or in hexes of the same coordinate, as that edge hex (depending on configuration of the map hex grid). All terrain in the off-map Setup Area(s) is considered ground-level Open Ground <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: half-hexes; <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.51" class="topiclink">A2.51</a>]</span>. On the other hand, all on~map terrain that is not in play in a given scenario remains in effect for &quot;offboard&quot; movement and entry purposes during that scenario.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF13 KINDLING:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chr_chrfootnotes.htm#22" class="topiclink">22</a></span> The British may not conduct Kindling attempts. German units may conduct Kindling attempts in any scenario taking place on/after 19 September (or on/after 19AM for CG Scenarios). Units marked with a No Move counter may not conduct Kindling attempts.</p>
<p><a id="14"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF14 BURNT-OUT WRECKS:</span> A Burnt-out Wreck cannot be Scrounged, set Ablaze, or removed from play as per <a href="chd_chd10.htm#10.4" class="topiclink">D10.4</a>. A Burnt-out Wreck is a LOS Hindrance exactly like a normal wreck.</p>
<p><a id="15"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF15 FRIENDLY BOARD EDGE:</span> Recalled German vehicles must exit via the North edge on/east of Hexrow Q, via the south edge from hex R23, or anywhere along the east or west board edges. British vehicles are never Recalled; treat Recall results (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.341" class="topiclink">D5.341</a>) as stun (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.34" class="topiclink">D5.34</a>) instead. Multiple stun results on British Vehicle crews have no additional effects.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF16 GERMAN AFV:</span> German Vehicle crews may not voluntarily Abandon non-immobilized vehicles <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: SPW 250/sMG HT and SPW 250/7 HT]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="17"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF17 TRENCHES:</span> Trenches are considered to &quot;connect&quot; (as per <a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.8" class="topiclink">B30.8</a>) to (but not through) all ADJACENT building/rubble Locations <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: not to a Location that is rubbled during play of that scenario]</span> (see also <a href="chr_chr4.htm#4.21" class="topiclink">R4.21</a> and <a href="chr_chr4.htm#4.6" class="topiclink">R4.6</a>, last sentence). Infantry entering such a building/rubble Location need not pay an extra MF to leave the Trench in that Location, but must still pay applicable building/rubble COT. Infantry leaving such a building/rubble Location need not pay an extra MF to enter a &quot;connecting&quot; Trench. Infantry may not enter such a Trench while using Bypass Movement, nor may they use Bypass Movement while in such a Trench; nor may they exit such a Trench to directly use Bypass Movement. A unit entering/leaving a building/rubble Location via a &quot;connecting&quot; Trench is not subject to Snap Shots as it does so. A vehicle must pay the appropriate MP-costs/penalty to cross such a Trench while using VBM; hence those vehicle types not allowed to cross a Trench may not do so while using VBM. Infantry may enter a Fortified Building Location as if that building were not Fortified provided they enter it from a Trench &quot;connected&quot; to that building Location.</p>
<p><a id="18"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF18 WHITE PHOSPHOROUS:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chr_chrfootnotes.htm#23" class="topiclink">23</a></span> German squads may use WP Grenades (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.3" class="topiclink">A24.3</a>) as if they were 1944 British. Any German ordnance capable of firing Smoke (i.e., has a Depletion Number) is also considered to have a WP6 Depletion Number printed on the reverse of the counter. For the purposes of WP Fires (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.32" class="topiclink">A24.32</a>), EC are always considered Very Dry and the -2 Kindling DRM for buildings (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.32" class="topiclink">A24.32</a>) is NA.</p>
<p><a id="19"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF19 MISCELLANEOUS:</span> The river is deep with a Moderate Current to the west. Bore Sighting is NA. The difference in color between the darker colored green hexes near the river bank and the other Level 0 hexes on the map are for artistic purposes only. All such darker hexes are considered Level 0. Each Friendly Setup Area or Entry Area is considered separately for the purposes of any percentage calculations (e.g., Deployment, <a href="cha_cha1.htm#1.31" class="topiclink">A1.31</a>, <a href="cha_cha2.htm#2.9" class="topiclink">A2.9</a>; Cloaking, <a href="che_che1.htm#1.411" class="topiclink">E1.411</a>; allowed HIP, <a href="chr_chr9.htm#9.619" class="topiclink">9.619</a>, <a href="che_che1.htm#1.2" class="topiclink">E1.2</a>).</p>
<p><a id="20"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF20 SPECIAL AMMUNITION AVAILABILITY:</span> The OB of both sides is considered Elite (<a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">C8.2</a>) for the purposes of special ammunition supply.</p>
<p><a id="21"></a><span class="f_Strong">ABtF21 RUBBLE:</span> Rubble is considered a building for the purposes of Rout, Rally, and Ambush. A factory hex which is rubbled is still considered part of the factory for LOS purposes (EX: if hex M17 is rubbled, units occupying the rubble still have LOS to M19 as if M17 were still a standard ABtF factory hex).</p>
