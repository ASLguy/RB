<p class="p_Example"><img src="s112ex.gif" width="359" height="308" alt="s112ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: The German is the FRIENDLY side, the north edge of the map is to the left (i.e., the FBE is toward the bottom of this illustration), hence the hex rosette on the left would be used (if necessary) to determine a random advance, as its configuration aligns with the map's hexgrid. It is the start of the APh; the player needs to determine the advance maneuvers for the Advance Attitude ENEMY units depicted above. The squad in O7 stays in place as it possesses the Lt Mtr and has a Target. Next, the 5-2-7 in O9 advances into P8 in order to move closer to the FRIENDLY Controlled VPO (it could also have entered P9, but P8 has higher inherent TEM).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">The 4-4-7 squad in P6 must also advance toward the R8 VPO Location; the player moves the unit into Q7 (rather than P7, its other choice), as Q7 has higher hexside TEM than its other choice (P7). The Russian 4-4-7 &quot;D&quot; advances into the ground level of R6, as it has higher inherent TEM than Q7 (its other choice), which precedes hexside TEM in the <a href="chs_chs11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">11.2</a> Priority List. The units already in the R6 building Location will attempt to enter into CC with the FRIENDLY unit in the S7 foxhole (since it is Accessible to a FRIENDLY occupied Location the <a href="chs_chs11.htm#11.2" class="topiclink">11.2</a> guidelines do not apply) (see <a href="chs_chs11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">11.4</a>; Advance into CC/Melee).</span></p>
<p><a id="11.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.3 IN A DEPRESSION: </span>An eligible Activated ENEMY Infantry unit IN a Depression Location will use the APh to assume Crest status in that Location if a Target would be available for it from that position.

To do so it must pass a NTC (Leadership applies) using the following applicable DRM (or normal PAATC if advancing into a FRIENDLY AFV's Location). Failure to pass the TC results in the unit instead remaining in its present Location. Take one TC for each such eligible ENEMY unit, (best-class) leader first.</p>

The unpinned Advance Attitude ENEMY units in the ground level of R6 must attempt to advance into the Accessible FRIENDLY occupied Location (S7) by passing a NTC (<a href="chs_chs11.htm#11.4" class="topiclink">11.4</a>). The 8-0 leader takes his NTC first; a -1 DRM applies as he's in Advance Attitude, and another -1 DRM since the German unit in S7 possesses a HW (even though dismantled). The leader easily passes his NTC DR with a &quot;5&quot;. Next, the 6-2-8 squad takes its NTC; it also has a -1 DRM due to Advance Attitude, a -1 DRM for the German HW in the Location to be (potentially) advanced into, and (now) a -1 per ENEMY unit already entering the Location (since the leader passed his NTC and is slated to enter). However, even with the cumulative -3 DRM, it fails the NTC by rolling an Original 12. The leader's advance into CC is now cancelled, however, since he is allowed to advance only if accompanying another ENEMY MMC (<a href="chs_chs11.htm#11.41" class="topiclink">11.41</a>).</span></p>
