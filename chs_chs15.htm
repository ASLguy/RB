<p><a id="15.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.1 FRIENDLY UNITS: </span>The FRIENDLY side begins each Mission with 130 BPV (or as specified otherwise in a MSR) with which to purchase Infantry MMC (only) of the selected FRIENDLY nationality using the <a href="chh_chh1.htm" class="topiclink">Chapter H DYO</a> method. Such purchases should be made after the Mission's parameters have been determined, but before FRIENDLY MSR given units are determined and before S? are setup <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if playing the SASL CG the player's starting units are determined as per <a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.13" class="topiclink">17.13</a>]</span>, FRIENDLY vehicles and Guns are obtained only as per MSR or due to FRIENDLY RE occurrence. FRIENDLY units initially setup-for/enter the Mission as noted in the &quot;Sequence&quot; section of each Mission. To purchase the FRIENDLY force, use only rules <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.2" class="topiclink">H1.2-.26</a>, <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.28" class="topiclink">H1.28</a>, and <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.74" class="topiclink">H1.74-.83</a>.</p>
<p><a id="15.2"></a><img src="concealger.gif" width="61" height="61" alt="CONCEALger" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">15.2 FRIENDLY HIP UNIT:</span> Each FRIENDLY HIP unit is never a Target as long as it remains hidden. Such a unit can be placed onboard but should be covered with a ⅝&quot; &quot;?&quot; marker; use ½&quot; &quot;?&quot; markers for all other forms of FRIENDLY concealment during a Solitaire Mission. NOTE: the last sentence of <a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.3" class="topiclink">A12.3</a> is disregarded when using this solitaire system.</p>
<p><a id="15.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.21 FRIENDLY MINEFIELD:</span> During a Mission FRIENDLY minefield Locations may be marked on the mapboard(s) by the appropriate minefield counter placed onboard in the Location. If not yet Known to the ENEMY the counter should face toward the player. Once an Activated ENEMY unit has been attacked by the minefield (by any result other than &quot;-&quot; on the IFT) the minefield is considered &quot;Known&quot; by the ENEMY and the counter is rotated to face toward the EBE.</p>
<p><a id="15.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.3 COLUMN/CONVOY:</span> FRIENDLY units may begin a Mission setup in Column/Convoy (<a href="che_che11.htm" class="topiclink">E11.</a>) formation at the player's option. Unless otherwise noted, a Convoy vehicle has full PP capacity in SASL.</p>
<p><a id="15.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.4 SPECIAL CAPABILITIES:</span> A special capability (i.e., <a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.22" class="topiclink">H1.22-.26</a>) bought for a unit(s) of the FRIENDLY OB does not apply to FRIENDLY RE reinforcements unless so specified by RE or MSR.</p>
<p><a id="15.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.5 &nbsp;FRIENDLY UNIT ENTRY:</span> FRIENDLY units may be kept offboard (indefinitely), even if allowed to initially setup onboard. Each FRIENDLY unit (including each FRIENDLY RE unit <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: as per MSR]</span>) entering from offboard must do so along the (current) FBE. Reinforcing FRIENDLY units enter, in part or in whole, on/after their initial turn of availability. Each OB-given unit is available at Mission start.</p>
<p><a id="15.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.6 FRIENDLY UNIT EXIT:</span> A non-prisoner FRIENDLY unit may exit off the FBE during any RtPh or FRIENDLY MPh/APh (whether in Good Order or not). Any such exited unit is not considered eliminated for Casualty VP/CG purposes but may not reenter the mapboard during that Mission. Each FRIENDLY unit exited off a non-FBE is considered KIA <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: as required by a MSR/RE]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="15.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.7 &nbsp;FRIENDLY WEAPON SPIKING: </span>The ENEMY is awarded the Casualty VP value of any FRIENDLY Gun/vehicle intentionally destroyed by a FRIENDLY unit. Each captured FRIENDLY vehicle/Gun, and each FRIENDLY unit taken prisoner, is worth double Casualty VP value at Mission end (<a href="cha_cha26.htm#26.222" class="topiclink">A26.222</a>).</p>
<p><a id="15.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.8 &nbsp;FRIENDLY SEARCH/MOPPING-UP CASUALTIES:</span> Searching by a FRIENDLY unit can only remove ENEMY concealment (it will never reveal an ENEMY HIP unit/Fortification [<a href="chs_chs15.htm#15.9" class="topiclink">15.9</a>]). FRIENDLY casualties due to Search/Mopping-up occur in the normal manner (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.154" class="topiclink">A12.154</a>; i.e., the Casualty dr must be made by the player in an attempt to cause casualties to the FRIENDLY side).</p>
<p><a id="15.9"></a><span class="f_Strong">15.9 MOPPING UP ACTIVATION:</span> When a building is Mopped Up (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.153" class="topiclink">A12.153</a>) by a FRIENDLY unit(s), there is a chance that a HIP ENEMY unit(s) will be Activated <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Prevailing Attitude is Advance]</span>. Make a DR and apply a -1 DRM for each (non-Rooftop) Location of the building in excess of three that has not had a FRIENDLY unit in it. If this Final DR is ≤ 2 a Mop Up Activation occurs. Make a subsequent DR {A1} to determine the unit(s) Activated (if any). Each such Activated unit is placed in the Location of that building that is ADJACENT to the Location containing the most Mopping Up units (Random dr if ≥ two such Locations exist). Once all such units are eliminated the building is considered secured.</p>
