<p><a id="16.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.1 &nbsp;COMMAND CONTROL:</span> &nbsp;Each FRIENDLY unit, &nbsp;like each ENEMY unit, has the potential to Panic (even if offboard; <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.33" class="topiclink">16.33</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs13.htm#13.61" class="topiclink">13.61</a>, <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.32" class="topiclink">16.32</a>]</span>. The player does not know if a unit will be functional (in Command) for the current (ENEMY or FRIENDLY) Player Turn until its Command DR (CMD DR) is taken. Note that the following Command Control rules are in effect for the FRIENDLY side only; ENEMY Command Control is inherently built into the ENEMY Action Table DR {A2}.</p>
<p><a id="16.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.2 CMD#:</span> A FRIENDLY unit (including offboard/RE reinforcements) must first pass a CMD DR by rolling ≤ its Command Number (CMD#) in order to perform any non RPh/RtPh activities during the current Player Turn <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs13.htm#13.61" class="topiclink">13.61</a>, <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.32" class="topiclink">16.32</a>]</span>. A unit's CMD# is based on its morale, as per the following listing:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A leader/crew has a CMD# one &gt; its current Morale Level</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A squad/HS has a CMD# equal to its current Morale Level</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A vehicle has a CMD# one &gt; its current Morale Level (<a href="chd_chd5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">D5.1</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a SMC Rider/Passenger may use his own CMD# if it is greater]</span></p>

Passage of the CMD DR allows that unit to perform actions normally for the remainder of that Player Turn. Failure to pass the CMD DR results in that unit being immediately marked with a Panic marker; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.211" class="topiclink">6.211-.213</a> apply. An Original CMD DR of 12 always results in Panic. A CMD DR does not activate a Sniper (<a href="cha_cha14.htm#14.1" class="topiclink">A14.1</a>), nor is it a concealment-loss activity. Note that FRIENDLY and ENEMY units Panic by different methods, but the effects (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.21" class="topiclink">6.21-.213</a>) are the same.</p>
<p><a id="16.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.31 DRM:</span> The following Cumulative DRM apply to a unit's CMD DR:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;-1 &nbsp; if non-Stopped</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;-1 &nbsp; if in Convoy/Column/platoon formation</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;-1 &nbsp; if the unit has an Acquired Target</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;-1 &nbsp; CE AFV</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;-1 &nbsp; SMC possessing functioning radio/field-phone &amp; OBA is available</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;-1 &nbsp; Japanese Leader<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chs_chsfootnotes.htm#10" class="topiclink">10</a></span></p>
<p><a id="16.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.32 EXCEPTED UNITS:</span> A FRIENDLY unit that is berserk/broken/held in Melee/under Recall/Heroic/in Ocean Location/on a boat while in a Water Obstacle hex is never subject to Command Control. A FRIENDLY heroic leader exerts his Command Influence range (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.4" class="topiclink">16.4</a>) normally. All units in a Convoy/Column/platoon take a single CMD DR for the entire formation. The CMD# of the best FRIENDLY (armor) leader or Vehicle in that formation is used.</p>
<p><a id="16.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.33 OFFBOARD PANIC:</span> A FRIENDLY unit that Panics when offboard may not enter during that Player Turn. It must remain in its current (offboard) setup hex until the next FRIENDLY Player Turn, when it may again attempt to enter. All offboard whole-hexes are considered OG for FRIENDLY Command LOS purposes.</p>
<p><a id="16.34"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.34 PASSENGERS/RIDERS:</span> A Passenger/Rider is in Command if its transporting vehicle passes its CMD DR. However, if the unit becomes Infantry it must pass a new CMD DR in order to perform further actions in that Player Turn. If a vehicle transporting a Passenger/Rider fails its CMD DR its Passenger/Rider may attempt to pass its own CMD DR, passage of which allows the transported unit to continue actions normally for that Player Turn (e.g., unload; become CE/BU if in an armored halftrack; attack).</p>
<p><a id="16.35"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.35 LOADING/UNLOADING:</span> In order to load/unload (or hook/unhook; <a href="chc_chc10.htm#10.11" class="topiclink">C10.11-.12</a>), only the Personnel unit(s) wishing to perform such an activity need pass a CMD DR.</p>
<p><a id="16.36"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.36 SPOTTED FIRE:</span> If a Spotter (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">C9.3</a>) passes its CMD DR the unit(s) it is spotting for is also considered in Command, but only for purposes of Spotted fire for that Spotter, otherwise the unit performing Spotted fire must pass its own CMD DR.</p>
<p><a id="16.4"></a><img src="incommand.gif" width="168" height="59" alt="incommand" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">16.4 LEADER COMMAND INFLUENCE RANGE:</span> Each Good Order, unpinned, non-Captured FRIENDLY Personnel (non-armor) leader exerts his Command Influence into all Locations in his LOS within two hexes, as well as the Location he is in, at the moment his CMD DR is made. If pinned, such a leader exerts his Command Influence only into his currently occupied Location. See <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.43" class="topiclink">16.43</a> for a (Passenger/Rider) Personnel leader's Command effect on vehicles. A leader may have his CMD DR made as soon as he or any unit within his Command Influence Range wishes to perform its first action or to utilize its Command Influence. Mark each leader that passes his CMD DR with an &quot;In CMD&quot; marker.</p>
<p>Like a FRIENDLY Personnel leader, a FRIENDLY CE armor leader also has a two-hex Command Influence range. However, such a leader can only exert his Command Influence over other FRIENDLY vehicles, and only if all such vehicles are CE, or using platoon/Convoy movement, and within his LOS <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.32" class="topiclink">16.32</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="16.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.41 &nbsp;EFFECTS:</span> Each Good Order FRIENDLY MMC/lower rated leader (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.421" class="topiclink">16.421</a>) is automatically in Command (i.e., is considered to have passed its CMD DR) if any FRIENDLY leader exerting his Command Influence into its Location passes his CMD DR, even if that leader subsequently moves/breaks/pins/is eliminated, leaving the unit out of his Command Influence range. Once a FRIENDLY leader has passed his CMD DR, each FRIENDLY unit subject to that leader's Command Influence may perform actions, and at least one such unit must perform an action before another leader's CMD DR is made. A unit must first use a (higher-rated) leader's CMD DR as his own CMD DR if the unit is with in that leader's Command Influence range. If each leader that could exert his Command Influence into a MMC's Location fails his CMD DR, the unit may then, and only then, attempt its own CMD DR.</p>
<p><a id="16.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.42 &nbsp;MULTIPLE LEADER INFLUENCE:</span> If any one leader exerting his Command Influence over a unit passes his CMD DR, that unit is in Command for that Player Turn. Otherwise it must pass its own CMD DR.</p>
<p><a id="16.421"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.421 RANK:</span> A leader cannot exert his Command Influence over a FRIENDLY leader of equal or higher type (i.e., with the same or better morale and Leadership DRM). If he is not in Command due to being in the Command Influence range of a higher-rated leader, he must use his own CMD DR. Commissars cannot exert Command Influence over, nor benefit from the Command Influence of other leaders.</p>
<p><a id="16.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.43 VEHICLES AND COMMAND INFLUENCE:</span> A Good Order, FRIENDLY, non-Captured Personnel leader exerts his Command Influence over a vehicle/its-PRC only if he is currently a Passenger or Rider of that vehicle <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Convoy/platoon; <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.32" class="topiclink">16.32</a>]</span>, or if that vehicle/its PRC is (CE if an AFV and) in the leader's hex and in his LOS. Such a Personnel leader that is a Passenger/Rider on a Motion vehicle exerts his Command Influence only over his transporting vehicle and any other same-vehicle PRC. A leader that is a Passenger/Rider on a stopped vehicle exerts his Command Influence normally <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a Passenger leader in an AFV must be CE in order to exert his Command Influence over any non-Passenger of the same AFV]</span>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="s1643ex.gif" width="327" height="458" alt="s1643ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: In the illustration above the base level of all hexes enclosed by the red lines are within the two-hex Command Influence range (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.4" class="topiclink">16.4</a>) of the FRIENDLY 9-1 leader in 12Z5; each FRIENDLY Infantry unit in such a Location is in Command if the 9-1 passes his CMD DR by rolling ≤ 10 (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.2" class="topiclink">16.2</a>). The StuG in the 9-1's Location is not subject to his Command Influence since it is BU (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.43" class="topiclink">16.43</a>), and must therefore pass a CMD DR of its own (CMD DR of ≤ 9; <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.2" class="topiclink">16.2</a>) in order to be in Command during the current Player Turn. The truck in Y6 must also pass its own CMD DR as it is not in the 9-1's Location (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.43" class="topiclink">16.43</a>). Half-Squad B (IN the gully) and squad C (in X4) are not within the 9-1 's Command Influence range since they are not in his LOS.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Additionally, all MMC units within the blue lines are in the Command Influence range of the 8-0 in Z3, who is within the Command Influence range of the better-rated 9-1. Note, however, the 10-2 leader in AA2 is not in command, as the 8-0 (a lesser-rated leader) has no effect on him. Thus, if the 9-1 passes his CMD DR, all MMC units (and the 8-0 SMC) in hexes enclosed by all lines will be in Command. If the 9-1 fails his CMD DR (Original DR ≥ 11) another leader may attempt his CMD DR. If the CMD DR of the 10-2 is successful (Original DR ≤ 11), the 8-0 will automatically be in command. Additionally (if the 8-0 is in command), squad A in Z5 and each MMC enclosed by the double white lines will be in command (but not the 9-1; <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.421" class="topiclink">16.421</a>). If each FRIENDLY leader fails to pass his CMD DR, each FRIENDLY (non-leader) unit may then attempt its own separate CMD DR. Each such unit must roll ≤ its current morale level to be in command. Regardless, halfsquad B IN the BB5 gully will have to pass its own separate CMD DR, as it is out of all FRIENDLY leader's Command Influence range. The FRIENDLY hero in X1 is always in Command (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.32" class="topiclink">16.32</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Squad C wishes to Prep Fire as the first action of the German PFPh. The 10-2 leader may make his CMD DR at this time because the lesser ranked 8-0 leader in Z3, which is within the Command Influence Range of the 10-2, wishes to exercise its Command Influence over squad C—which is within the Command Influence Range of the 8-0 (<a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.4" class="topiclink">16.4-.41</a>).</span></p>
