Each unit/Weapon listed in a company's OB is considered Directly Attached to that company (<a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.131" class="topiclink">17.131</a>).

<p><a id="18.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">18.2 DATE VARIATIONS:</span> During the course of the war the OB of each nationalities' basic Infantry (aka Rifle) Company was at times reorganized, not only due to attrition, or as a response to enemy reorganizations, but also to incorporate new or improved Weapons (and to phase out obsolete ones). Therefore, each nationality often has several Infantry/Rifle Companies listed. The proper company to use depends on the date of the current Mission of the CG (<a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.21" class="topiclink">17.21</a>).</p>

<p>• &nbsp;In 9/43 the Italian company conducts one Mission against a German ENEMY after which the player decides whether to continue the campaign as Allied Italian or Fascist Italian. One Extended Rest and Refit is conducted following which all conscript MMC are upgraded to 2nd line. A Fascist (RSI) company conducts Missions against American, British, and Partisan ENEMIES beginning 11/43, and may have a German Ally. An Allied company conducts Missions against a German ENEMY beginning 12/43 and may have an American and/or British Ally. <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: A Blackshirt company does not conduct a 9/43 Mission against a German ENEMY and must continue as a Fascist company.</span></p>

<p>The Finnish Generation and Random Event Tables will be included in the upcoming release of Hakkaa Paalle, the Finnish extension of the ASL system. The following apply to Finnish units:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;A FRIENDLY Finnish Company is considered to have an underscored Morale Level of 8 for purposes of <a href="chs_chs12.htm#12.321" class="topiclink">12.321</a> (only).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Any time an AFV is rolled for on activation of a Finnish ENEMY S?, make a dr. If ≤ 2, substitute a squad for the AFV. This rule is N/A if the Mission is 'Tank Attack!&quot;.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;A FRIENDLY Finnish infantry company makes a dr at the start of any campaign prior to 10/44. If the result is 1-3, the squad type is 6-4-8. If the result is 4-6 the type is 5-4-8. &nbsp;There is a -1 drm in 1939-40.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;A FRIENDLY Finnish company rolls on the Finnish SW Allotment Chart at the start of the campaign to determine which type of LMG and ATR are received. A new roll may be attempted during any Rest &amp; Refit (<a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.9" class="topiclink">17.9-.91</a>) step.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;All squads/HS in a Sissi company are commandos (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.24" class="topiclink">H1.24</a>) and have MOL capability (<a href="chh_chh1.htm#1.25" class="topiclink">H1.25</a>).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;In 1939-40, make a dr prior to each Mission. If the result is ≤ 3 all Finnish non-crew MMC have MOL capability for the duration of the Mission.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;In 1939-40 any Russian ENEMY 5-2-7 and 6-2-8 squads are replaced by 4-4-7 and 4-5-8 squads respectively.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Any German AFV (FRIENDLY or ENEMY) generated are determined on the German AFV table on the Finnish Generation Card.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;Following any 8/44 Mission, a Finnish infantry company conducts one Extended Rest &amp; Refit (<a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.91" class="topiclink">17.91</a>) in 9/44, following which all 6-4-8 are converted to 5-4-8 and all 5-3-8 to 4-4-7. From 10/44 through 4/45, the Finnish company conducts missions against a German ENEMY. The Finns are not eligible to have an Ally (<a href="chs_chs2.htm#2.7" class="topiclink">2.7</a>) during this period.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;If an ENEMY Japanese infantry unit is required by the {A4} ENEMY Infantry Movement Tables to conduct non-assault movement towards a FRIENDLY unit that could result in a negative modifier to a FP attack against it (not counting leadership modifiers) from that FRIENDLY unit, that Japanese unit will instead declare a Banzai charge against that FRIENDLY unit, provided that its location can be entered that turn.

<p>• &nbsp;If ≥ 60% of the US# of all retained MMC of this company are elite and if the player's CG VP score is currently positive (<a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.51" class="topiclink">17.51</a>), the company is awarded Guards Status for the remainder of the CG (see modifier for MMC-Type Replacement Table). In addition, the Rifle company's HMG is replaced with a .50 cal HMG.</p>
<p>† Starting in 1943 many rifle and parachute companies became mixed companies with an SMG platoon replacing one of the rifle platoons. Prior to any 1943 or later mission, the player may permanently replace any three first line or elite rifle squads with their SMG equivalent. Prior to any 1944 or later mission, the player may replace an additional three squads in the parachute company with their SMG equivalent (for a total of six).</p>
