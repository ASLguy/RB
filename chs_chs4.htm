PLACEMENT:</span> The &quot;S? Placement/Entry&quot; section of each SASL Mission states the method that S? are setup-on/enter the mapboard configuration. If S? are to begin the Mission setup on the map, the player will be instructed to set up S? according to one or more of the following cases (a-e, following). Use a black background S? counter for each initially placed/entering S? (as well as for subsequently appearing S? of the same Attitude and governed by the same generation procedures as initially placed/entering S?; <a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.2" class="topiclink">3.2</a>). Refer to each Mission's section on &quot;S? PLACEMENT/ENTRY&quot; for more specific instructions on initial placement/entry of S? for that Mission. A maximum of two S? may be initially placed per on-board Location [EXC: 4.1e].</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">(a)</span> One S? in each (non-Rooftop/-Sewer) building/rubble/lumberyard Location [EXC: <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11-. 13</a>].</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">(b)</span> One S? in each woods/brush Location (including such depicted terrain as may be modified for other theaters such as PTO) that has an odd or even coordinate (as determined by a single at-start odd or even dr for each mapboard of the configuration; consider a coordinate of &quot;0&quot; as even) and is either part of ≥ three connected woods/brush Locations (i.e., the woods/brush depiction extends across a hexside(s) &quot;connecting&quot; to the woods/brush depiction in the ADJACENT Location) or is such a Location that is connected to the EBE in a Mission in which that edge may have additional mapboards activated along it [EXC: <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11-. 13</a>].</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Before beginning the &quot;Bunker Busting&quot; Mission the player must place S? according to 4.1's cases a and b. Two mapboards have been determined. As per case a, one S? is placed in each building/lumberyard Location (at each level) on both maps that is not within three hexes of a whole offboard hex along the FBE. Next, the player makes a dr for each map to determine S? Locations for case b. Both dr are even, therefore he now places one S? in each even-numbered woods/brush Location on each map, providing that Location is a part of a group of three or more connected woods/brush hexes. Note however, since no additional maps may be activated during this particular Mission, a woods/brush Location that is along (or connected to) the EBE is not eligible (unless it is part of a group of three or more connected woods/brush hexes).</span></p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">(c)</span> One S? in each VPO Location (including each non-Rooftop/-Sewer Location of a VPO building) regardless of terrain <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a S? is not placed on a multi-hex bridge unless the Location is Accessible to a land hex]</span>, as well as each Concealment Terrain Location ADJACENT to each VPO Location [EXC: <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11-. 13</a>].</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">(d)</span> One S? in each VPO Location (including each non-Rooftop/-Sewer Location of a VPO building) regardless of terrain <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a S? is not placed on a multi-hex bridge unless the Location is Accessible to a land hex]</span>, as well as each Concealment Terrain Location within two hexes of each VPO Location [EXC: <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11-. 13</a>].</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">(e)</span> For each just-placed mapboard, make a dr {A6d} to determine the number of Letter Chits to be drawn. Draw all Letter Chits (each chit drawn determines a hexrow of the mapboard); after all Letter Chits are drawn make a subsequent dr +2 (resulting in a Final number ranging from 3 to 8) for each chit selected. This dr +2 determines the coordinate number of the hexrow determined by the Letter Chit, thus determining a &quot;placement hex&quot;. Then make a dr {A6f} for a radius, in hexes, that S? are to be placed from the &quot;placement hex&quot;. Place one S? in each eligible Concealment Terrain Location <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11-. 13</a>]</span> within the determined hex-radius of each placement hex (including any such Location[s] in the &quot;placement hex&quot; itself). A maximum of one S? may be placed per Location using this method, even if a hex is within the radius &gt; one &quot;placement hex&quot;. An OG Location is considered Concealment Terrain for purposes of this S? placement method if a theoretical line of fire (regardless of whether such a LOS actually exists) from any level of (any of) the nearest off-board whole hex(es) of the FBE would cross a wall/hedge/bocage hexside of that Location and an ENEMY unit therein could gain wall advantage along such a hexside. Once all such S? are placed on a mapboard, return all Letter Chits to their opaque container, and repeat the procedure (as necessary) for each remaining mapboard.</p>
<p>NOTE: If &nbsp;≤ two S? are placed for a Letter Chit repeat the procedure (remove the just-placed S? [if any], draw a new Letter Chit and make a new placement dr).</p>
<p>Please see Example.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="s41ex.gif" width="442" height="328" alt="s41ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">4.1 EX: S? are to be placed on mapboard 33 according to 4.1e. The FBE is from A1 to GG1. The player's dr on Table {A6d} is a 3, giving a result of &quot;2&quot;. Therefore, two Letter Chits are drawn with the letters Q and S being displayed (thereby determining hexrows Q and S on board 33). Next, the player makes one &quot;dr +2&quot; for each letter chit selected. An Original dr of 4 for chit Q becomes 6, thereby determining hex 33Q6 as a placement hex. The &quot;dr +2&quot; for chit S is a 6, determining S8 as the other placement hex. Next, the player must make a dr for each placement hex, and consult Table {A6f} to determine the radius (in hexes) that S? are to be placed in Concealment Terrain Locations from each placement hex. The dr {A6f} for placement hex Q6 is 6, thus giving a result of &quot;1&quot;. One S? is placed in P5, P6 and each level of building hex R6. A S? is also placed in Q7 &quot;behind&quot; the Q6-Q7 wall hexside, as the LOF from the nearest offboard whole hex (offmap in hexrow Q in this case) would cross the Q6-Q7 wall hexside. Next, the &quot;radius&quot; dr {A6f}for placement hex S8 is a 4, thus giving a result of &quot;2&quot;. Therefore, one S? is placed in each level of building hex R7, and at ground level in hexes R8 and S8. A S? is placed in U8 (&quot;behind&quot; the U7-U8 hedge hexside) and in U9 (&quot;behind&quot; the U8-U9 hedge hexside), as the LOF from the nearest offboard whole hex would cross those hedge hexsides (respectively). Too, if Grain is in season, a S? would be placed in Grain hexes T6 and U7, as both are within two hexes of placement hex S8. Note that only one S? is placed in each Location of Q7 and R6 despite those Locations being within the determined radius of both placement hexes.</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">If the FBE instead ran from A10 to GG10, S? could not be initially placed in P8, R8, S8, U8 or U9, as all of these hexes are within three hexes of a whole offboard hex along the FBE (<a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.11" class="topiclink">4.11</a>). However, a S? would now be placed in U7 (regardless of season due to the U7-U8 hedge hexside.</span></p>
<p><a id="4.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.11 PROXIMITY TO FBE:</span> Regardless of the method used to place S?, a S? may never be initially setup within 3 hexes of any whole off-board hex along the FBE.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: S? are to be placed on board 4 according to <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1a</a> (only). The mapboard has been aligned such that the FBE extends from A1 to GG1 (the board number is towards the south). Buildings P1, S2 and X1 may not have S? setup in them due to their proximity to the FBE. A S? is setup in T3, however, since it is not within 3 hexes of any whole offboard hex along the FBE (i.e., it is not within three hexes of whole offboard hex &quot;S0&quot; or 'T0&quot;).</span></p>
<p><a id="4.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.12 S? PLACEMENT ON BUILT-UP MAPBOARDS:</span> Table {A9e} is used to determine S? setup (non-Rooftop/-Sewer) Locations of each building/rubble hex on a mapboard with ≥ 19 rubble-Locations/buildings (marked with the &quot;v&quot; and &quot;c&quot; prefixes on Table A9), even if the entire mapboard is not in play. S? counters placed in a rubble/building hex for any of cases <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1</a> a, c, d or e are removed if none of the determined Location(s) (as determined by a dr {A9e} for each hex) exist in that hex (e.g., a Final dr of 3 [&quot;none&quot;] or 5 [&quot;Second Level&quot;] {A9e} would have no effect for a Single Story House) [EXC: if such a hex contains ≥ one VPO Location, reroll until ≥ one S? is placed in a VPO Location of that hex]. For purposes of this rule, each rowhouse hex is considered a separate building.</p>
<p><a id="4.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.13 &nbsp;WOODS MAPBOARD:</span> Any S? placed in a woods whole/half hex on a Woods mapboard (marked with the &quot;w&quot; prefix on Table A9), for any of cases <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1</a> b, c, d, or e remain on the board following a subsequent dr ≤ 3 (roll for each S? placement Location separately) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if placed in a VPO Location, no dr is needed]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="4.14"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.14 &nbsp;S? IN CREST STATUS:</span> A S? setting up in a Depression Location is placed in Crest status (<a href="chb_chb20.htm#20.9" class="topiclink">B20.9</a>) so that the unit's LOS toward the FBE crosses as many crest hexsides as possible.</p>

If the determined entry hex is illegal/NA, repeat the procedure for that S?. </p>
<p><a id="4.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.21 S? ENTRY ALONG THE LENGTH OF A MAPBOARD:</span> Draw one Letter Chit for each Advance Attitude S? scheduled to enter along the length (i.e., the 22&quot; side) of a mapboard. The ID of the Letter Chit determines the hexrow along that edge the S? will enter. Set up the entering S? in the RPh just offboard, next to that hexrow <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Overstacked (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.11" class="topiclink">3.11</a>), or Prohibited (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.323" class="topiclink">3.323</a>), pick a new Letter Chit]</span>. Return each Letter Chit to the cup after placing its determined S?, before the next chit is drawn.</p>
<p><img src="s421.jpg" width="257" height="189" alt="s421" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">EX: Seven S? are scheduled to enter on the EBE of the board configuration shown at left. The player now randomly draws one Letter Chit from the opaque cup for the first S? to be placed. Since this Letter Chit has the ID letter &quot;G&quot; he sets up the first S? just off the east edge opposite hex 16G10, then returns the Letter Chit to the cup. He repeats this process six more times, once for each S? scheduled to enter on that turn. It is possible to have &gt; one S? enter along the same (Alternate) Hex Grain.</span></p>
<p><a id="4.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.22 S? ENTRY ALONG THE WIDTH OF A MAPBOARD(S):</span> For each Advance Attitude S? scheduled to enter along the width of ≥ two mapboard(s) (depending upon the number of mapboards presently in the mapboard configuration or as per special entry instructions, if any) the player makes a DR in the RPh of the turn of entry. (If the S? are eligible to enter only along the width of a single mapboard, only a dr is necessary.) Disallow any river mapboard from the selection process. The colored dr (of the DR) is used to randomly determine the mapboard (of a multi-mapboard configuration) that the S? will enter. The player mentally assigns each eligible mapboard a number(s) from 1 to 6 so that each eligible mapboard of the configuration has equal odds of being selected (e.g., if two mapboards are eligible S? entry maps, one mapboard is assigned the numbers 1, 2 and 3 while the other is assigned the numbers 4, 5 and 6). The white dr (of the DR), modified by +2, determines the hex coordinate number of the mapboard that the S? will enter. Place each S? just offboard, adjacent to the hex it is to enter <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Overstacked (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.11" class="topiclink">3.11</a>), or Prohibited Location (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.323" class="topiclink">3.323</a>), make a new placement DR]</span>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: Using the mapboard configuration pictured in the 4.21 EX, the player is to enter five S? in a &quot;flank attack&quot; along the north edge of the configuration. All mapboards are eligible entry boards. The player assigns the numbers one and two to board 3, three and four to board 2 and five and six to board 16. His first DR is a red 5 and a white 2. Therefore, he places a S? next to hex 16GG4, just off the north edge. The next DR is a red 2 and a white 6. The player places the next S? adjacent to hex 3A8 just off the north edge. This process is repeated until all S? scheduled to enter that turn are placed.</span></p>
<p><a id="4.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.3 SASL HUMAN WAVE S?:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chs_chsfootnotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">3</a></span> A Human Wave may occur due to a RE, or as a standard part of a Mission (e.g. Mission 14). All ASL Human Wave rules (<a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.23" class="topiclink">A25.23-.235</a>) apply except as amended below. Each SASL Human Wave S? should be a different color from all non-Human Wave S? since a SASL Human Wave S? (even if not currently part of a Human Wave) always uses the Human Wave Generation table {x10} when rolling for generation. Each unit engaging in a SASL Human Wave receives the ML increase regardless of the Player Turn. Each Human Wave S? is considered as two squads for stacking/VP purposes.</p>
<p><a id="4.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.31 ENTRY:</span> Each turn a SASL Human Wave is to enter, randomly determine two hexes along the EBE. Use either <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.21" class="topiclink">4.21</a> or <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.22" class="topiclink">4.22</a> to determine the hexes, depending on the edge being entered. Each of the two hexes thusly determined, and each hex between them, is an entrance hex for one SASL Human Wave S? <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: repeat the procedure if the two determined hexes have ≤ 2 hexes, or ≥ 11 hexes, between them]</span>. Place a HW Direction counter (<a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.231" class="topiclink">A25.231</a>) on the EBE on a hexrow corresponding to an entrance hex.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A SASL Human Wave is to enter along the length of board 19. Using the method stated in <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.21" class="topiclink">4.21</a>, the player draws two Letter Chits from their opaque container, resulting in hexrows &quot;B&quot; and &quot;E&quot; being specified. However, this would not be legal, as &quot;the two determined hexes have ≤ 2 hexes between them&quot;. Therefore, the two chits are returned to the cup, and the player repeats the process. This time chits &quot;F' and &quot;T&quot; are drawn. Unfortunately, this is also not legal, as hexrows F and T have thirteen other hexrows between them. Therefore, these Letter Chits are also returned to the cup, and two more chits are selected. The third draw results in chits &quot;N&quot; and &quot;X&quot;. This is legal since hexrows N and X have nine hexrows between them.</span></p>
<p><a id="4.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.32 ACTIONS: </span>Each Activated ENEMY unit that is part of a SASL Human Wave automatically has a Move Action (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.305" class="topiclink">6.305</a>) and is never subject to Panic during its Player Turn <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Leader; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.317" class="topiclink">6.317</a>]</span>. A SASL Human Wave unit always moves/advances toward the FBE. During movement, however, Human Wave units should attempt to Control any FRIENDLY Controlled VPO when such is possible during their movement toward the FBE. See also <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.323" class="topiclink">4.323</a>.</p>
<p><a id="4.321"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.321 MPh:</span> SASL Human Wave units move as per <a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.231" class="topiclink">A25.231-.234</a> except that LOS to a FRIENDLY unit within eight hexes is not required (indeed, when entering from offboard such LOS is not possible), nor is it necessary to have a leader present in the Human Wave. A SASL Human Wave unit has 8 MF and moves before all other non-Human Wave units <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Berserk; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.301" class="topiclink">6.301</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="4.322"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.322 APh:</span> The APh should be used to close any gaps (or as many as possible) occurring in a SASL Human Wave (due to FRIENDLY defensive fire or movement around obstacles). If all such gaps cannot be closed, the player should instead attempt to close as many as possible in order to have the most units eligible to use Human Wave movement subsequently. If gaps do not need to be closed, SASL Human Wave units advance toward the nearest Target(s), and in so doing strive to avoid creating gaps.</p>
<p><a id="4.323"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.323 SUBSEQUENT TURNS:</span> Each ENEMY unit in a SASL Human Wave continues Human Wave movement in subsequent turns until it has entered a Location occupied by a Known opposing unit(s), is broken, eliminated, has exited off the FBE, or has been released from Human Wave movement due to obstacle interference (<a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.33" class="topiclink">4.33</a>). In order for an ENEMY unit to use Human Wave movement on a subsequent turn there must still be ENEMY MMC/S? in a chain of ≥ 3 contiguous hexes with an average of ≥ 2 such MMC per hex (<a href="cha_cha25.htm#25.23" class="topiclink">A25.23</a>); however, the presence of an ENEMY leader is not necessary. Other Activated ENEMY Infantry units must be added to the Human Wave <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if possessing functioning SW]</span>, provided such is in proper position at the start of its MPh.</p>
<p><a id="4.324"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.324 &nbsp;MULTIPLE WAVES &nbsp;PRESENT:</span> &nbsp;If multiple (on/offboard) Human Waves are present, the wave with the unit that is closest to the FBE moves first.</p>

Such S? no longer able to continue Human Wave movement maintain Advance Attitude and use Table {xlO} for Activation. However, such already-Activated former Human Wave units unable to continue in the formation assume the Prevailing Attitude.</p>
<p><a id="4.34"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.34 GENERATION:</span> Whenever a SASL Human Wave S? is Activated (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.32" class="topiclink">3.32</a>), make a dr on the &quot;Human Wave Unit Generation&quot; table {x10} to determine the units generated. No AC dr (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>) is required for Activation of a Human Wave S? (even if that S? is no longer using Human Wave movement). A Human Wave S? can never be a dummy. SASL Human Wave units (only) may continue movement after Activation, MF permitting.</p>
