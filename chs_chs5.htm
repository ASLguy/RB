Panic is not possible for such a just-Activated unit. If the FRIENDLY unit(s) is a Target for only one (or some) ENEMY unit(s)/Weapon(s) in a Location with multiple ENEMY units/weapons, only that unit(s)/Weapon(s) fires; each non-firing unit remains concealed. If the Activated unit has &gt; one Weapon that can be fired at the Target, the player should fire such in the relative order of effectiveness vs that Target, or as a FG (player's discretion). If the moving Target expended ≥ 2 MF/MP to enter the Location Subsequent-FF/ROF attacks are conducted as possible until that Target loses its Good Order status (or is eliminated if berserk). See also <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.31" class="topiclink">5.31-.32</a> and <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.13" class="topiclink">8.13</a>. Please see the Example.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><img src="s53ex.gif" width="471" height="330" alt="s53ex" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Example">5.3 EX: In the illustration it is the German MPh in an East Front, August 1941 Mission with clear weather; the Russian side is the ENEMY. The current ENEMY AC# is 3 (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>). German squad V uses Assault Movement to enter K6, making both S? in O6 eligible for Activation (case C of table {R1}: range = four; Final IFT DRM = 0). The player must first make the AC for the S? most likely to Activate. Since the Russian S? on the first level has a -1 AC drm (-1 per level above the hex's Base Level) its AC is rolled first. Rolling an Original dr of 5 {R1}, modified to 4, nothing is Activated (as four is not ≤ 3, the current AC#) and the S? on the first level of O6 is removed (it was a dummy). The player then makes an AC dr {R1) for the S? at ground level in O6. Rolling an Original dr of 2 (no drm apply) results in a successful AC. The player then makes a DR {A1} to determine what unit(s), if any, are Activated. Unless the Final DR is a 7 (which would result in a dummy) the Activated unit(s) will First Fire (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">5.3</a>) at the Target causing its AC (squad V, in this case).</span></p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">Next, squad W uses Assault Movement to enter O9. The S? in P8 and on the first level in P6 are both eligible for Activation (the former because the opposing unit is ADJACENT, case F of table R1; the latter because an opposing Infantry unit is at a range of ≤ 4 hexes with a Final IFT DRM of ≤ 0, table R1's case C). Again, the S? in the upper level must have its AC performed first. An Original AC dr of 6 {A1} results in no Activation (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>). The player then makes an AC for the S? in P8, rolling an Original dr of 1 {A1}, resulting in an automatic Activation. He then makes a DR {A1} to determine the unit(s) Activated, if any. Each unit Activated in the FRIENDLY MPh fires at the unit causing its AC if such a unit is a Target for it.</span></p>
<p><a id="5.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.31 CONTINUING ATTACKS:</span> If an attack (as per <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">5.3</a>) fails to cause the opposing moving unit(s) to lose its Good Order status (or eliminate a berserk unit) the next eligible S? must be checked for Activation, and so on, until either the opposing unit(s) loses its Good Order status (eliminated if berserk) or all S? eligible for Activation by that moving unit in its current Location have been checked for Activation.</p>
<p><a id="5.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.32 LONG RANGE ACTIVATION: </span>A S? is eligible for Activation during the FRIENDLY MPh as soon as all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;the moving unit(s) is non-vehicular,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;if fired upon from the S?'s Location, the moving unit(s) would have a Final IFT DRM of &lt; -2, and</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• &nbsp;the S? is ≤ 16 hexes from the moving unit(s), but is otherwise ineligible for Activation due to it being beyond the range listed in case A of the ENEMY'S AC table {x1}.</p>
<p>When a S? so qualifies, make a DR. An Original DR of &quot;2&quot; results in the S? automatically Activating; if the Activation DR is ≥ 3 no Activation occurs but (unlike normal Activation, <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>) the S? is not removed.</p>
<p>Each S? Activating due to Long Range Activation automatically generates one squad {x2} possessing a HMG <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: .50 cal HMG on Subsequent dr of 1 if such is available for the ENEMY nationality]</span> (any HMG Activated due to Long Range AC is never dm) and one leader {x3; a special -1 Cumulative DRM applies; reroll until a leader is determined}; if the S?'s Attitude was HOLD a dr {A5} is also made for possible fortification. Only one such Long Range Activation DR can be made per moving unit/stack regardless of the number of Locations traversed by the unit(s). Furthermore, only one such S? can be Activated per moving unit/stack. Activate the closest eligible S? to the moving unit(s) if &gt; one S? qualifies; otherwise determine the S? Activated by a Random dr. The just-generated squad must First Fire the HMG (using the leader's direction and its own FR if applicable) at the moving Target(s) as per <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">5.3</a> and <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.13" class="topiclink">8.13</a>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The FRIENDLY side is the German; the Russians are the ENEMY. The player wishes to move his FRIENDLY 4-6-8 Infantry squad and a 9-2 leader from 33B5 into the woods in 33E2, via hexes B4, B3, C3 and D2. There are no ENEMY units with LOS to the Locations the FRIENDLY units will enter except for a S? in 33N9 and another S? in 33O9. However, since both of these S? are beyond the longest range given in Table R1 (i.e., case A's 8-hex range), the player decides to chance the maneuver, knowing that the only danger to the units would be due to Long Range Activation. Feeling confident, the squad and leader use non-Assault Movement to enter the woods in B4, and then the OG in B3. At this point, the player must make a Long Range Activation DR as both S? are eligible for Long Range Activation. The player's worst fears are realized, however, as the DR is an Original &quot;2&quot; resulting in the closest eligible S? (in N9) Activating. The player thus makes a DR {R2} for squad type, and generates a 4-5-8. His DR for leader generation is equally ominous, resulting in a 9-2 leader. A subsequent dr for HMG type must also be made, since a Russian .50 cal HMG is possible. Fortunately, this dr is a &quot;4&quot;, and a standard &quot;6-12&quot; HMG is generated. These just-generated ENEMY units must now conduct First Fire vs their Targets in B3. The player cringes as he rolls the dice for the &quot;6 minus 4&quot; attack. To his wild delight, however, a 12 is rolled, breaking the HMG! The FRIENDLY squad and leader can now proceed to E2 safely, since only one S? may be Activated due to Long Range Activation per moving unit/stack. Assume now, however, that another FRIENDLY squad (also starting its MPh in 33B5) follows in the tracks of the previous German units. When this unit enters OG hex B3 (and survives the Residual FP attack) the remaining S? in 33O9 now checks for Long Range Activation. This time the Long Range AC DR is a &quot;9&quot;. The S? does not Activate and the German squad continues on its way toward E2. Note that the S? in O9 is not removed, and can again be checked for (Long Range) Activation should yet another FRIENDLY unit(s) move.</span></p>
<p><a id="5.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.4 &nbsp;CA SELECTION:</span> Whenever an ENEMY AFV/Gun/fortification (that must have its CA determined) is Activated a CA must be selected for it (MA if armed vehicle) that includes the FRIENDLY unit causing its AC, and as many other Targets as possible.</p>
<p><a id="5.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.5 &nbsp;ACTIVATION BY FRIENDLY DEFENSIVE FIRE:</span> &nbsp; An ENEMY unit Activated by FRIENDLY Defensive fire will use its AFPh to fire. Perform an Action DR (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.2" class="topiclink">6.2</a>) during the ENEMY AFPh for each such ENEMY unit. Barring Panic, each such unit with a Target automatically receives a Fire Command {A3}.</p>
<p><a id="5.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">5.6 &nbsp;ACTIVATION PROCEDURE:</span> Each successful AC (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>) requires a subsequent DR on the ENEMY Activation Table {A1} <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.32" class="topiclink">5.32</a>].</span> Apply DRM as necessary, depending on the Mission being played (see MSR). The Final DR on this Table indicates the type of ENEMY unit(s) being Activated <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a Final DR of seven results in nothing being Activated]</span>. A non-dummy result occurs if an AFV, squad (S), half squad (HS), leader (L), fortification (F), support weapon (SW) and/or Gun is Activated.</p>
<p>Further DR (or dr, as necessary) are then necessary to determine the specific unit(s)/Weapon(s)/fortification Activated. Each such Activated item is generated in the order presented in the table A1 result. Generation tables are found on the ENEMY nationality's &quot;Generation Tables&quot; card <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: fortifications {A5}]</span>. See the following list for explanations of the various abbreviations used in table A1 and what subsequent generation table(s) is/are necessary to determine each unit Activated.

The additional TEM of a just-Activated fortification might render the PTC (causing the Activation) ineffective or reduce the effect of other IFT results, or even turn a hit into a miss.

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A Russian S? has had a successful AC (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>). The player now consults table {A1}, rolling an Original DR of 4. Because he is playing the &quot;ENEMY Offensive&quot; Mission there is a -1 DRM, giving a Final DR of 3, resulting in &quot;S, S, L, F, SW&quot;. The player now performs two separate DR {R2} to determine the two squad types. He rolls Original DR of 2 and 9, both of which are modified by +2 since the date is August 1941. Thus a 4-5-8 elite squad and a 4-2-6 Conscript squad are Activated (Final DR of 4 and 11, respectively). Because a leader may also be Activated (the &quot;L&quot; in the A1 Table result) the player makes another DR {R3}. An Original DR of 6 results in a Final DR of 6 (as the +1 date DRM and the -1 DRM for &quot;Any accompanying MMC is elite&quot; cancel out), resulting in an 8-0 leader being Activated. However, since the date is prior to 10/42, it is possible the 8-0 leader is replaced by a 9-0 Commissar. The player rolls a subsequent dr of 4, resulting in the 8-0 being received after all. The &quot;F&quot; result (for Fortification) is ignored since the Activated unit has no Smoke making ability (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.74" class="topiclink">5.74</a>). Lastly, since a SW may be Activated with one of the MMC (the &quot;SW&quot; in the result), the player makes a DR {R4} using the appropriate (i.e., &quot;1941&quot;) column (no DRM apply). His DR of 3 results in a dm light mortar being Activated (dm because the Russian is in Advance Attitude; <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.752" class="topiclink">5.752</a>), and possessed by the MMC with the highest BPV in the Location (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.751" class="topiclink">5.751</a>), in this case the 4-5-8 squad. Thus an 8-0 leader, a 4-5-8 squad possessing a dm light mortar, and a 4-2-6 squad are Activated.</span></p>

<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: The player controls the Germans in an August 1941 &quot;Bunker Busting&quot; Mission on the Eastern Front. FRIENDLY units have just fired on a S? on the first level of a Two Story House, achieving a NMC. The AC dr is successful, requiring a subsequent DR on table {A1} (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>). The Original DR is a 12 (a +2 DRM applies since the Mission is &quot;Bunker Busting&quot;) resulting in a Final DR of 14. The {A1} result is &quot;S, F, Gun&quot;. First the ENEMY MMC is determined {R2}. Next, an Original dr of 4 is made {A5}, modified to a Final dr of 3 due to MSR drm, resulting in a successful fortification Activation. Since the fortification is occurring in a building, the Location (as well as the ground-level Location beneath the Activation Location) is automatically Fortified (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.742" class="topiclink">5.742</a>). Finally, a DR is made {R5} using the 1941 &quot;Inside&quot; column (since the Gun is being generated in a building Location). The {R5} DR is a 5 (no DRM apply), resulting in the generation of a 45L AT Gun with a manning 2-2-8 (Infantry) crew (5.76), which must now undergo a PTC.</span></p>
