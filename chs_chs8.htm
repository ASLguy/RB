<p class="p_Strong"><a id="8.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.1 FIRE COMMAND:</span> Most ENEMY attacks are determined by the Fire Command randomly assigned to the ENEMY unit(s) eligible to fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: automatic Fire Command (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.306" class="topiclink">6.306</a>; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.311" class="topiclink">6.311</a>; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.314" class="topiclink">6.314-.3142</a>); ENEMY First Fire (<a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.61" class="topiclink">8.61-.612</a>); ENEMY artillery strike (<a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.7" class="topiclink">8.7</a>); ENEMY sniper attack (<a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.8" class="topiclink">8.8</a>)]</span>. Only an unbroken Activated ENEMY unit with a Target may be given a Fire Command. When such a unit is to have its Fire Command determined (as per <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.23" class="topiclink">6.23</a>) the player makes a DR on the applicable ENEMY Attack Table {A3a-d} (<a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.11" class="topiclink">8.11</a>) to determine the Fire Command. Once determined, that unit's Fire Command must be performed before another unit's Action occurs <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: FG possible; <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.5" class="topiclink">8.5</a>]</span>. See also <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.13" class="topiclink">8.13</a>.</p>
<p><a id="8.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.11 ENEMY ATTACK TABLES:</span> The specific ENEMY Attack Table {A3a-d} used to determine an ENEMY unit's Fire Command depends on the unit/Weapon firing and the available Target(s). The title of each ENEMY Attack Table indicates the type of attack it is used for; i.e., Ordnance firing at a vehicular Target uses table {A3c}; IFT attacks vs Infantry/PRC use table {A3a), etc.</p>
<p><a id="8.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.12 PRIORITY LIST:</span> Each Fire Command is given in the form of a Priority List in order to determine the Target(s) when &gt; one exists. The player consults the Fire Command's Priority List to select the Target. If the Target is still undetermined by the end of the Priority List the player should make a Random dr (from among the Targets the Fire Command has narrowed it down to thus far) to determine the Target.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">SAMPLE FIRE COMMAND:</span> The following is a Fire Command (#10) from the &quot;IFT ATTACKS vs INFANTRY/PRC&quot; {A3a) table:</p>
<p>10 Fire Inherent FP at closest Known target; most Known targets; least TEM; most Good Order targets; most Weapons; most Target SMC. If no Known targets exist fire at concealed Target with the same priorities.</p>
<p>SW: Fire SW at target in least TEM; closest; Location with the most targets; most target SMC. Combine with Inherent FP if necessary.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: It is the ENEMY PFPh and an ENEMY squad with a functioning LMG has been assigned the above Fire Command. It is instructed to fire its &quot;Inherent FP at closest Known Target&quot;. If there are ≥ two such Target Locations the player then reads the second listing which, in this case, instructs the unit to fire at the Location with &quot;most Known Targets&quot;. If ≥ two such Locations still exist the player proceeds to the next listing (in this case the Location with the &quot;least TEM&quot;), and so on until a Target Location for the unit's Inherent FP attack is determined. Since this Fire Command has a separate &quot;SW&quot; listing (and since the firing unit in this case possesses a functioning SW) the player uses the SW Priority List to determine the LMG's Target. In this case, the LMG is to fire at the 'Target in least TEM&quot;; if &gt; one such Target exists the SW fires at the closest Target in the least TEM: if &gt; one such equidistant Target in least TEM exists the LMG fires at the Location (from among the previously determined ones) that contains the most Targets, etc.</span></p>
<p><a id="8.13"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.13 ROF:</span> An ENEMY Weapon maintaining its ROF continues attacking its Target until that Target loses its Good Order status (eliminated if berserk), at which point a new Target is determined using a new Fire Command. See also <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">5.3</a> and <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.61" class="topiclink">8.61</a>.</p>

<p><a id="8.23"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.23 ENEMY PANZERFAUST:</span> A Good Order ENEMY unit with Inherent PF capability will attempt to fire such (<a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.31" class="topiclink">C13.31-.34</a>) at a FRIENDLY AFV Target within range for that type and year of PF, provided the Final To Hit roll needed is ≥ 4. The player need not keep track (<a href="chc_chc13.htm#13.31" class="topiclink">C13.31</a>) of ENEMY PF usage (as the number of ENEMY squads is not known).</p>
<p><a id="8.24"></a><img src="immobile.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="IMMOBILE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8.24 DELIBERATE IMMOBILIZATION ATTEMPT:</span> An ENEMY Ordnance Weapon will attempt Deliberate Immobilization vs a FRIENDLY AFV (if qualified; <a href="chc_chc5.htm#5.71" class="topiclink">C5.71</a>) providing that AFV can only be affected by a Final TK DR of ≤ 4.</p>
<p><a id="8.25"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.25 SPECIAL AMMUNITION:</span> ENEMY use of special ammo types (APCR/APDS/HEAT/SMOKE), Canister, Smoke Dispensers, and API HE Limited Stowage ammo types (<a href="chc_chc8.htm#8.8" class="topiclink">C8.8</a>) is best left to the player's discretion. Use such special ammo/capabilities to the best advantage of the ENEMY. Such ammo depletes normally (<a href="chc_chc8.htm" class="topiclink">C8.</a>).</p>
<p><a id="8.3"></a><img src="9-2russian.gif" width="57" height="59" alt="9-2russian" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8.3 LEADER DIRECTION:</span> The best Good Order ENEMY leader (even if heroic) in the same Location as a firing ENEMY unit(s) will direct that fire if he has no other Automatic Action to perform (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.317" class="topiclink">6.317</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Leader direction is not used if the Final leader direction DRM would be positive; e.g., due to the cumulative effects of wound/heroic/personal DRM]</span>. Leader direction of a non-Indirect-fire SW (with the SW with the highest ROF taking priority) takes precedence over direction of an Indirect-fire SW.</p>

If he is in the same Location as ≥ one same side Infantry MMC capable of utilizing his FP/Heroic DRM he will perform Actions with that unit(s). If with a stack of moving Infantry the hero will move with the largest (in US#); best-class; with HW; with other (longest range) SW. When possible, an ENEMY hero should attempt to stack with Good Order ENEMY MMC.</p>
<p><a id="8.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.5 &nbsp;ENEMY FIRE GROUPS:</span> ENEMY units fire as a FG as follows.</p>
<p><a id="8.51"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.51 &nbsp;PFPh:</span> Each Good Order ENEMY Infantry unit in the same Location that has a Fire Action must fire in its PFPh as a FG if possible<span class="f_EXC"> [EXC: if Ordnance]</span>. The player makes one DR on the applicable ENEMY Attack Table {A3a} to determine the Target. If all FP of the FG cannot be concentrated vs that Target (e.g., due to range limitations) any unused FP should be used vs another Target(s), using the Priority List of that same Fire Command. Otherwise reroll for a new Fire Command for any still unused FP.</p>
<p><a id="8.52"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.52 AFPh:</span> A Multi-Location FG should be formed in the ENEMY AFPh so to maximize FP. Make a DR {A3} for each such FG to determine the Target (no Action DR is necessary as such was made for the unit[s] during the PFPh). If necessary, use your discretion to limit the size of the FG or to determine its Target. &nbsp;See <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.36" class="topiclink">4.36</a> for Human Wave FG.</p>
<p><a id="8.53"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.53 DEFENSIVE FIRE:</span> Only same Location FG are allowed during any type of ENEMY defensive fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Human Wave FG; <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.36" class="topiclink">4.36</a>]</span>. Such a FG fires as per <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.51" class="topiclink">8.51</a>.</p>
<p><a id="8.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.6 ENEMY DEFENSIVE FIRE:</span> ENEMY units conduct Defensive (First) Fire as follows.</p>
<p><a id="8.61"></a><img src="firstfire.gif" width="58" height="58" alt="FIRSTFIRE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">8.61 FIRST FIRE VS NON-VEHICULAR TARGETS:</span> Each Good Order Activated ENEMY unit/Weapon conducts defensive fire at a moving non-vehicular FRIENDLY Target during the FRIENDLY MPh if the movement of such a Target would cause a hypothetical S? in the Activated unit's Location to be checked for Activation (<a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">5.1</a>) (i.e., apply the AC dim of the ENEMY'S table {x1} as if the Activated ENEMY unit were still a S?; no AC dr is required, as the ENEMY unit is already Activated) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.611" class="topiclink">8.611</a>]</span>. The ENEMY unit must First/Subsequent First/Final Protective Fire (as appropriate) at the moving non-vehicular Target if an AC dr would otherwise be necessary <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.613" class="topiclink">8.613</a>; also, if the ENEMY unit is a ⅝&quot; Ordnance with an Acquired Target that would have to change its CA]</span>. ENEMY leadership DRM, if any, apply. An Action DR {A2} must still be made for each firing unit(s) (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.12" class="topiclink">6.12-.2</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.3" class="topiclink">5.3</a>]</span>; however, barring Panic, that unit(s) will conduct immediate Defensive Fire at the moving Target.</p>
<p>If a S? is also eligible for Activation (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.31" class="topiclink">3.31b/e</a>), the AC for such is made {x1} only after the fire resolution of any/all already Activated unit(s) eligible to fire, and then only if the Target is still eligible (as per <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.31" class="topiclink">5.31</a>).</p>
<p>If the moving Target(s) expended ≥ 2 MF/MP in the Location, subsequent attacks are conducted by that/other eligible unit(s) until the Target loses its Good Order status (eliminated if berserk) or such attacks are no longer possible.</p>
<p><a id="8.611"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.611 &nbsp;LONG RANGE HW FIRST FIRE:</span> A Good Order activated ENEMY unit possessing &nbsp;a functioning &nbsp;(and assembled) &nbsp;HW must First/Subsequent First Fire that Weapon at a Known moving Target that has a net IFT/TH DRM of ≤ 0 within the Weapon's (long) range.</p>
<p><a id="8.612"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.612 FIRST FIRE VS VEHICLE:</span> During First Fire an ENEMY Ordnance Weapon should fire, at the player's discretion, before a moving vehicular Target has a chance to leave the Weapon's LOS; otherwise it should wait for the best possible shot (depending on range/Target facing). See also <a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.2" class="topiclink">8.2-.25</a>. ENEMY Infantry will attempt (CC) Reaction Fire or Street Fighting whenever possible.</p>
<p><a id="8.613"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.613 FINAL PROTECTIVE FIRE:</span> An ENEMY unit eligible for FPF vs an ADJACENT Target uses such only if it passes a NTC, using the Target's TEM and any FFMO/FFNAM modifiers as TC DRM <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Panicked; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.212" class="topiclink">6.212</a>]</span>.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: A FRIENDLY non-berserk squad uses non-Assault Movement to enter a wooden building Location ADJACENT to an ENEMY squad marked with CX and First Fire markers. The ENEMY squad must conduct Final Fire at the FRIENDLY squad (<a href="chs_chs8.htm#8.61" class="topiclink">8.61</a>). If this attack fails to cause the FRIENDLY unit to lose its Good Order status the ENEMY squad then takes a TC in order to make a FPF attack (since the Target used two MF to enter the ADJACENT building Location), with a +1 DRM to its TC (+2 building TEM; -1 FFNAM; the +1 for CX does not apply as it is not a TEM). Failure of the FPF TC has no effect other than to disallow the FPF attack by that ENEMY unit vs that specific Target.</span></p>

<p>If &gt; one FFE is received on the same turn, place each subsequent FFE on the next applicable stack (respectively) (e.g., if three ENEMY FFEs are received on the same Player Turn the third FFE placed would be on the FRIENDLY stack third-closest to the EBE with a minimum US# of three). After initial placement of each FFE, perform a Correction DR for each (identical to the <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.31" class="topiclink">C1.31</a> &quot;Direction/Extent of Error DR&quot;); no DRM apply.</p>
<p><a id="8.711"></a><span class="f_Strong">8.711 INELIGIBLE UNITS:</span> A FRIENDLY subterranean/aerial/HIP unit is never considered for ENEMY OBA FFE placement or continuation.</p>
