<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="9.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.1 ORDER OF MOVEMENT:</span> Each ENEMY berserk unit (if any; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.301" class="topiclink">6.301</a>) moves before any other ENEMY unit, then Human Wave units (<a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.321" class="topiclink">4.321</a>). Thereafter, carry out Move Commands, and move Advance Attitude S? (<a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.321" class="topiclink">3.321</a>), in the same order as given in <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1</a> (including each on or offboard unit). If a Location contains multiple ENEMY units that must have separate Move Actions performed use a Random dr to determine which moves first (e.g., a leader/vehicle moving separately from same-Location MMC). If movement for a vehicle is not possible consult footnote 2 {A2} for an alternate Action.</p>
<p><a id="9.2"></a><img src="move.gif" width="56" height="56" alt="MOVE" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">9.2 MOVE COMMAND:</span> In SASL, the movement of an Activated non-Immobile ENEMY unit is determined by the Move Command assigned to it <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if an Automatic (Move) Action applies (e.g., <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.301" class="topiclink">6.301-.309</a>, <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.317" class="topiclink">6.317</a>)]</span>. Only a Good Order Activated non-Immobile ENEMY unit may be given a Move Command and only during the ENEMY MPh when that unit is ready to move. All such Infantry units in Advance Attitude use the same Move Command {A4b} (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>). If in Hold Attitude, all Infantry starling the MPh in odd-numbered hexes have a Move Command {A4a} (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>) determined for them, and all Infantry in even-numbered hexes have another Move Command {A4a} (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>) DR made for them (the same Move Command could possibly be used for all). Regardless of Attitude, each ENEMY non-Immobile vehicle has a Move Command {A4c} (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">9.21</a>) determined for it individually <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: all vehicles of the same AFV platoon (<a href="chd_chd14.htm" class="topiclink">D14.</a>) use the same Move Command]</span>. ENEMY Infantry should move in stacks at player's discretion (usually if such movement is relatively free from FRIENDLY Defensive Fire). Remove the Move counter from each unit when its movement is completed.</p>
<p>When a Move Command seems ambiguous, given the moving ENEMY unit and its map position, use your discretion in moving the unit. Attempt to do what is in the best interest of the moving unit considering the Move Command received. When a choice exists, the unit should usually take the safest route available, rather than the most direct. An Infantry unit that is unable to perform its Move Command is instead marked with an Opportunity Fire marker.</p>
<p>Each ENEMY Infantry Movement Table {A4a-b} has a &quot;hex rosette&quot; specific to it (found in the upper portion of each table) used to determine the hex entered by a moving unit. Throughout the play of a Mission the player will use either the right or the left (never both) rosette pictured. Use the rosette whose hex configuration aligns with the mapboard's hexgrid.</p>
<p class="p_Example"><span class="f_Example">EX: In the <a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.23" class="topiclink">9.23</a> illustration north is to the left. In SASL the FBE is always considered the west edge, which the player should situate closest to him (see FBE definition; <a href="chs_chsintro.htm#.1" class="topiclink">S.1</a>); the illustration reflects this by having the west edge aligned toward the bottom, or &quot;closest&quot; to the player. With the map aligned thusly, the player would then use the hex rosette on the far right of each Infantry Movement Table (the one not &quot;X'ed out&quot; in the inset above the <a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.23" class="topiclink">9.23</a> illustration). Consider the unit to be moved as being in the hex with the black square; hexes eligible for the unit to enter from its current Location are illustrated with a series of numbers in them which can be used with a dr to determine a unit's move randomly (see <a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.23" class="topiclink">9.23-.24</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="9.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.21 ENEMY MOVEMENT TABLES:</span> The specific ENEMY Movement Table {A4a-c} used to determine an ENEMY unit's Move Command depends on the type of unit moving and its current Attitude. The title of each ENEMY Movement Table indicates the type of unit that uses it; e.g., &quot;Hold Attitude ENEMY Infantry Movement Table&quot; {A4a}.</p>
<p><a id="9.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.22 PRIORITY LIST:</span> Most Move Commands are given in the form of a Priority List which provides some &quot;choices&quot; for the unit's move. The player consults that Priority List and selects the first Move Command priority that can be fulfilled. As usual, subsequent instructions of the Priority List can be used to help further define the Move Command, as necessary.</p>
<p><span class="f_Strong">SAMPLE MOVE COMMAND:</span> The following is Move Command (#5) from &quot;{A4a} HOLD ATTITUDE ENEMY Infantry Movement Table&quot;:</p>
<p>5 Assault Move into Location with TEM &gt; TEM of current Location; into Location with any positive inherent/hexside TEM with Target available therefrom; into any Location with positive TEM; random direction.</p>

The Hold Attitude ENEMY squad at ground level in the 4O6 wooden building has just been given Move Command 5 (DR of &quot;5&quot; using Table {A4a}; see above). Since it cannot Assault Move into a Location that has TEM greater than the TEM of its current Location, the next part of that Move Command's Priority List is checked. This instructs the unit to Assault Move into a &quot;Location with any positive inherent/hexside TEM with Target available therefrom&quot;. Using the instructions the player notes that the unit could Assault Move either behind the wall into 4O7, into the woods in 4N5, or up into the first level of its current hex—as from all of these Locations the Russian squad would have a LOS to the FRIENDLY Targets in 4M8 and 4N9. The player decides to move the 4-4-7 into the first level of 4O6 as it has better inherent TEM than the woods, and provides an unhindered view over the N8 Grain field.</span></p>

The Advance Attitude ENEMY vehicle in 33Q9 is to move according to Move Command &quot;≤ 4&quot; of the {A4c) ENEMY Vehicle Movement Table. Since the AFV in Q9 is on a road and no Known Target exists (FRIENDLY squad M, in LOS, is not a Known Target), it enters Q8 along the road (since it is not already CE it does not have to CE now). When it enters Q8, however, a Known Target will exist for it—the FRIENDLY squad in O8—and the vehicle now Stops. However, before expending a final MP to stop, the AFV changes its VCA to enclose hexes P7/P8, thus bringing its MA to bear on its only Known Target (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.34" class="topiclink">9.34</a>).</span></p>
<p><a id="9.23"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.23 RAS (Roll At Start):</span> Make a dr at the start of the Activated unit's MPh to determine its movement direction.

The unit moves along the determined Hex Grain throughout the MPh until either Pinned, no longer in Good Order, instructed to stop by its Move Command or further movement in the specified direction is no longer possible (e.g., due to lack of MF/MR Prohibited Location (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.26" class="topiclink">9.26</a>), board edge (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">9.4</a>), or FRIENDLY unit in the next Location to be entered).</p>

The Advance Attitude ENEMY squads in 4L5 and 4O5 have move Actions assigned {A2a}, and have just been given Move Command 10 {A4b} (since they are both in Advance Attitude, they both use the same Move Command; 9.2). The 5-2-7 moves first (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.1" class="topiclink">9.1</a>; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1</a>). Since ≥ one Known Target exists, the 5-2-7 must &quot;Assault Move into Location with best TEM. Being in Advance Attitude, the only eligible Locations are K6, L6 and M6, all of which have the same TEM of 0. The 5-2-7 cannot enter M5 and receive the +1 TEM of the AFV as that hex is not enterable by an Advance Attitude Infantry unit. Therefore, the 5-2-7 Assault Moves into the Grain in K6; there's no -1 for moving in OG, and it's toward the FBE. The player declines any First Fire at the moving unit, so it is now time for the 4-4-7's move. Since the 4-4-7 has no Known Target from its current Location, it must &quot;move full MF, RAS; stop upon entering building Location if Known target exists therefrom&quot;. First, the player makes a &quot;RAS&quot; dr to determine its general direction of movement. Consulting the hex rosette that matches the mapboard's hex configuration, a RAS dr of &quot;4&quot; has the 4-4-7 entering building Location 06. At this point the 4-4-7 stops moving since it is now in a building Location and has LOS to a Target (the FRIENDLY squad in P8). Note that even though the Russian 4-4-7 could have expended its &quot;full MF' (as per its Move Command), it is considered to have used Assault Movement (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.221" class="topiclink">6.221</a>).</span></p>

Continue to make a REH dr for the unit until it is either Pinned, no longer Good Order, or is instructed to stop by its Move Command or by the mapboard edge (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.4" class="topiclink">9.4</a>).</p>

Grain is in season. The Advance Attitude ENEMY squads in 24AA6 and 24CC5 have Move Actions assigned {A2a}, and have just been given Move Command 8 (&quot;Move full MF REH; stop upon entering a building Location if Target exists therefrom&quot;; {A4b}). The 5-2-7 moves first (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.1" class="topiclink">9.1</a>; <a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.1" class="topiclink">6.1</a>), and the player makes a &quot;REH&quot; dr of &quot;2&quot;; thus the Russian squad moves into AA7 (1 MF). The next move dr for the 5-2-7 is a &quot;1&quot;, so it enters woods hex Z7 (3 MF expended), where it must end its MPh, as none of the other Locations eligible for entry (Y8, Z8 or AA8) cost &lt; 1 MF. The 4-4-7 in CC5 moves next. Its first &quot;REH&quot; dr is a &quot;6&quot;; thus it moves into the building in DD5. The player notes that even though the unit has entered a building, it has no Target from this vantage point, thus must continue moving. Its next move dr is a &quot;3&quot; and it moves into the road in DD6, having now expended 3 MF. Even though the Russian squad has only 1 MF remaining (it was not instructed to use Double Time movement), it could conceivably enter CC7 on a move dr of &quot;1&quot;. Therefore the player makes another &quot;REH&quot; dr. Another &quot;3&quot; is rolled however, instructing the unit to enter hex DD7, but, as this would require the unit to expend &gt; 4 MF the 4-4-7 ends its MPh in DD6.</span></p>

Due to the complicated and varied nature of vehicular movement/fire options in ASL, here (perhaps more than anywhere else in SASL) the player may sometimes have to use his &quot;best judgment&quot; in carrying out a dictated action.<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chs_chsfootnotes.htm#5" class="topiclink">5</a></span></p>
<p><a id="9.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.31 CE/BU:</span> A CE ENEMY vehicle will BU as soon as possible after it has a LOS to a Known Target within twelve hexes, or whenever it is within the normal range of a Known, fully manned FRIENDLY possessed MMG/HMG. Some vehicular Move Commands provide further instructions on when to BU or become CE. Otherwise, a player may always choose to BU/CE an ENEMY AFV if such an action seems in the vehicle's best interest.</p>
<p><a id="9.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.32 MAPBOARD ENTRY:</span> Each ENEMY vehicle entering the map-board due to RE does so on the EBE road hex that has a contiguous path of connected road hexes toward the FBE. If ≥ two such road networks exist the vehicle follows the road with the most direct path (in number of MP; then number of hexes) to the EBE. If no such complete road network exists it enters on the road hex whose road network extends the farthest toward the FBE, and from there takes the path with the least number of bog/obstacle hexes toward that edge after leaving the road (possibly regaining another road later). On its turn of entry each ENEMY vehicle/platoon must attempt to use as many MP as possible without using ESB/becoming Overstacked and is not subject to Panic. When &gt; one vehicle is to enter at the same Location on the same turn, determine their order of entry randomly.</p>
<p><a id="9.321"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.321 ATTITUDE:</span> Each entering ENEMY vehicle maintains Advance Attitude until it (or a member of its platoon) has a Target, at which point it (the platoon) assumes the Prevailing Attitude.</p>
<p><a id="9.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.33 ENEMY PLATOON MOVEMENT:</span> Each ENEMY vehicle of the same type (only) entering on the same turn must do so using platoon movement (<a href="chd_chd14.htm#14.2" class="topiclink">D14.2</a>; regardless of the actual presence or absence of radio) and continue such movement until so released (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.331" class="topiclink">9.331</a>). When the lead vehicle of a moving ENEMY platoon ends an impulse with a Target in LOS it must stop (ESB if necessary). Each remaining vehicle of the platoon must continue to expend MP (if such remain available), using the restrictions of platoon movement, in an attempt to bring ≥ one Target into its LOS <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: such a vehicle will not enter a Location already occupied by ≥ one Good Order ENEMY vehicle; it will only enter a Bog Location if that is its only choice]</span>. The Delay MP expended by the stopped unit should be used for it to Bounding First Fire if possible.</p>
<p><a id="9.331"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.331 PLATOON RELAXATION:</span> Once an ENEMY vehicle platoon begins its MPh with ≥ one Target in its LOS the platoon movement restrictions for those vehicles are relaxed for the duration of the Mission <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if normally required to use platoon movement due to being radioless, in which case such vehicles must continue to use platoon movement as long as possible]</span>.</p>

<p><a id="9.34"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.34 &nbsp;CA DETERMINATION: </span> Upon stopping/ending its MPh an ENEMY vehicle will bring all possible functioning armament to bear on a Known Target(s), or on a Concealed Target(s) if no Known Target exists.

In no case will the vehicle/platoon enter the hex just exited.</p>
<p><a id="9.36"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.36 BOG HEX ENTRY:</span> An ENEMY vehicle will only enter a bog hex (any Location requiring a Bog DR to enter/exit it) if it has no alternative non-bog hex that it can enter from its present Location without reentering the hex last exited <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Mud (<a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.361" class="topiclink">9.361</a>); or if a Move Command instructs the vehicle to enter such a hex; e.g., in order to OVR]</span>.</p>
<p><a id="9.361"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.361 SECRET BOG DR:</span> If Mud or Deep Snow is in effect (<a href="chd_chd8.htm#8.23" class="topiclink">D8.23</a>) any path not blocked by woods or obstacle hexes is legal, though any paved road/runway hexes should be used as much as possible. Unless another player is available, the (normally Secret) Bog DR/dr is made at the conclusion of any (FRIENDLY or ENEMY) vehicle's movement. If the vehicle Bogs return it to the appropriate Location (if its exact VCA cannot be recalled make a Random dr among the possibilities). Any Defensive OVR/Bounding (First) Fire (or Sniper attacks caused by such) vs that vehicle occurring after the Bog Location is nullified (and considered, for all purposes, not to have occurred). </p>
<p><a id="9.37"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.37 BYPASS: </span>An ENEMY vehicle should use Bypass movement to avoid a potential Bog or Prohibited Location in order to complete its Move Command.</p>
<p><a id="9.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.4 ENEMY EXIT: </span>An ENEMY unit may only exit off the FBE <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a S? in Advance Attitude moves toward (and attempts to exit off) the opposite board edge from the edge it entered; if the unit's specific RE/MSR instructions dictate otherwise; Unarmed MMC (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.302" class="topiclink">6.302</a>); ENEMY Guard (<a href="chs_chs6.htm#6.303" class="topiclink">6.303</a>)]</span>. If an ENEMY unit's Move Command instructs it to exit off an ineligible edge, its move is halted in the last playable (half) hex entered.</p>
<p><a id="9.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">9.41 EXIT VP: </span>Each ENEMY unit exited off the FBE is awarded as normal Exit VP (<a href="cha_cha26.htm#26.23" class="topiclink">A26.23</a>) to the ENEMY side. Each exited S? counts as two Exit VP <span class="f_EXC">[EXC; 4VP if in Human Wave; <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.323" class="topiclink">4.323</a>]</span>.</p>
