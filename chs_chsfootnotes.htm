<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1.  <a href="chs_chs2.htm#2.11" class="topiclink">2.11 MARKING THE RE NUMBERS:</a></span> When playing a SASL Mission, it is intended that the Chapter J/K divider's &quot;Scenario Aid Card&quot; be used in conjunction with the Chapter S divider. Place the Chapter K divider so that the &quot;ASL Scenario Aid Card&quot; covers the top portion of the Chapter S divider, being careful to keep the RE and AC# tracks (as well as the boxes labeled &quot;RETAINED&quot; and &quot;ELIMINATED&quot; for storage of SASL CG Directly Attached units) visible.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2. <a href="chs_chs3.htm#3.3" class="topiclink">3.3 S? CONDUCT &amp; ACTIVATION:</a></span> As each FRIENDLY unit changes Locations (or expends MF/MP within the same Location), it is critical that you, the player, be aware of each S? with a LOS (even if potential; see S.2) to that moving/advancing FRIENDLY unit. It is important to the SASL system that a S? is checked for Activation as soon as it is eligible, but especially so due to the movement/advance of a FRIENDLY unit. Remember, you are also the &quot;eyes&quot; of the ENEMY. However, being human, it is almost inevitable that you will miss a chance for a S? to check for Activation (just consider it one of those fortunate times that your opponent was not paying full attention).. .just don't let it happen too often.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3. <a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">4.3 S? ENTRY IN HUMAN WAVE:</a></span> The SASL Human Wave rules (<a href="chs_chs4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">4.3-.37</a>) have been printed on a grey background color as they have limited applicability and need only be read when such a need occurs.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4. <a href="chs_chs5.htm#5.754" class="topiclink">5.754 BZK/PSK BACKBLAST:</a></span> Any Weapon that can cause a Backblast (including a PF) should rarely be used from a building/bunker Location where its usage could cause harm to ENEMY unit(s) therein.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5. <a href="chs_chs9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">9.3 ENEMY VEHICLES:</a></span> If a problem arises concerning an ENEMY vehicle's Move Command the player should improvise (as necessary) to the best advantage of the moving vehicle. However, in doing so, you should still try to carry through with the &quot;intent&quot; of the Move Command.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6. <a href="chs_chs12.htm#12.2" class="topiclink">12.2 MISSION SELECTION:</a></span> For a more historical game, you are invited to do some research to find out what the selected FRIENDLY nationality (or perhaps the specific unit that your FRIENDLY force is simulating) was historically doing on the selected Front during the current time period. Unit histories of various military formations, available in many public libraries, will prove most useful. Too, new SASL Missions may become available in future MMP publications.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7. <a href="chs_chs13.htm#13.22" class="topiclink">13.22 DETERMINE MAPBOARD:</a></span> Keep on the lookout for periodic updates of Table {A9} and {A10a) in the ASL Journal as new ASL mapboards become available.</p>
<p><a id="8"></a><span class="f_Strong">8. <a href="chs_chs13.htm#13.6" class="topiclink">13.6 RIVER BOARD:</a></span> Table (A9a} will require updating if additional river/canal mapboards become available.</p>
<p><a id="9"></a><span class="f_Strong">9. <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.31" class="topiclink">16.31 DRM:</a></span> Various Infantry MMC are given a special -1 drm to offset their lower morale rating.</p>
<p><a id="10"></a><span class="f_Strong">10. <a href="chs_chs16.htm#16.31" class="topiclink">16.31 DRM:</a></span> Japanese Leaders receive a -1 modifier to their CMD DR to represent the less likelyhood of panic in combat. The &quot;Code of Bushido&quot; instilled in the Japanese soldier was even more apparent in the officer core of the Imperial Army, where most officers opted for suicide, or &quot;hara-kiri&quot;, rather than surrender, or &quot;lose face&quot; to the enemy.</p>
<p><a id="11"></a><span class="f_Strong">11.  <a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.131" class="topiclink">17.131 DIRECTLY ATTACHED:</a></span> You may wish to make photocopies of the SASL Campaign Roster (found on the Chapter S divider), as it is intended that one will be used for each CG Mission played. In this way you can easily record all FRIENDLY Directly Attached units/Weapons that you begin and end each Mission with, in addition to any replacements received between CG Missions. Instead of recording ID numbers of units, one could alternatively use low lettered (or single lettered) units for Directly Attached units, and high lettered (double lettered) units for Temporarily Attached units (as long as several letters between the two types are not used.</p>
<p><a id="12"></a><span class="f_Strong">12.  <a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.1321" class="topiclink">17.1321 VP VALUE:</a> </span>Non-Russian/-Chinese Temporarily Attached units/weapons are given enhanced Casualty VP value so the player does not consider such as unnecessarily &quot;expendable&quot;, since they will not return to the company OB even upon survival of the Mission. Conversely, the value of Russian/Chinese Temporarily Attached units/Weapons are not increased due to the Russian philosophy of regarding such units as &quot;expendable&quot; and the Chinese lack of training resulting in such units being treated as &quot;expendable&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="13"></a><span class="f_Strong">13. <a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.14" class="topiclink">17.14 SW TEAM:</a></span> A SW team represents a pair (or more) of men who have received special training in operating one of the specified types of SW.</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="14"></a><span class="f_Strong">14. <a href="chs_chs17.htm#17.9" class="topiclink">17.9 REST &amp; REFIT:</a></span> Your company is needed to fight every day. Each time it is withdrawn to Rest and Refit, however temporarily, it taxes the resources of your parent division, forcing a reserve unit to take your company's place, or (worse yet) a neighboring unit to spread itself thinner in order to cover your sector.</p>
<p class="p_Strong"><a id="15"></a><span class="f_Strong">15. <a href="chs_chs18.htm#18.5" class="topiclink">18.5 X/Y FORCE COMPANY: </a></span>The United States provided many of the munitions and supplies used by China in World War II. Of particular note are two Chinese operational forces that received specific U.S. training: X-force which consisted of Chinese divisions trained in India and used to fight the Japanese in India and western Burma and Y-force consisting of Chinese divisions in the Chinese province of Yunnan fighting the Japanese in southern China and northern Burma. These were the forces nominally under command of General Joseph &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; W. Stilwell.</p>
<p><a id="16"></a><span class="f_Strong">16.<a href="chs_chs18.htm#18.59" class="topiclink">18.59 COMMANDO:</a> </span>Commandos were organized into 'Troops&quot; of roughly half-company strength. The Campaign &quot;Company&quot; for SASL is two such troops. Commando organization varied wildly by date and by locale so this formation may be modified as indicated by individual research. The player may choose to use the Airborne version of the 2&quot; mortar if desired.</p>
