<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="4.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.1</span> Palm trees are represented on the BRT map by 2-4 leafy symbols in a hex (EX: hex R10). &nbsp; The rules for palm trees (<a href="chg_chg4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">G4.1</a>) are modified as follows. A palm tree hex is treated as out of season (<a href="chb_chb14.htm#14.2" class="topiclink">B14.2</a>) vs aerial LOS/LOF/Sighting-TC. During a Tarawa Naval Bombardment, an affected palm tree hex, including palm-debris-palm (<a href="cht_cht4.htm#4.23" class="topiclink">4.23</a>), must take a NMC with a Morale Level of 8 <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Building-Palm, which takes a normal building NMC (<a href="cht_cht4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">4.3</a>)]</span>. Failure of the Naval Bombardment MC (as well as any event during play that would ordinarily result in placement of a shellhole counter; <a href="chb_chb2.htm#2.1" class="topiclink">B2.1</a> &amp; <a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.823" class="topiclink">C1.823</a>) causes debris; place a Palm Debris counter in the hex. Palm trees (including palm-debris) are not burnable terrain.</p>
<p><a id="4.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.2 PALM DEBRIS: </span>Palm debris (EX: S35) is Inherent Terrain (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.6" class="topiclink">B.6</a>) and Concealment Terrain (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">A12.12</a>). It has a +1 TEM and is a half-level LOS Hindrance. Palm-Debris provides a +1 DRM vs a Sighting TC (<a href="che_che7.htm#7.32" class="topiclink">E7.32</a>).</p>
<p><a id="4.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.21 MF/MP:</span> Infantry must expend one MF +COT (including Sand) to enter a palm debris Location. Only a fully-tracked AFV may enter palm debris and does so by expending ¼ (FRU) of its MP allotment and taking a Bog Check with an additional +1 DRM. Dash (<a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.63" class="topiclink">A4.63</a>), road bonus (<a href="chb_chb3.htm#3.4" class="topiclink">B3.4</a>), and the ½-MP road rate are NA in a road hex covered by palm debris, except via a TB.</p>
<p><a id="4.22"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.22 FORTIFICATIONS:</span> Placement of a Palm Debris counter removes all Entrenchment counters in that hex (although not necessarily their contents) after resolving all attacks against their occupants; otherwise, a Fortification may exist in a palm debris Location unless other terrain/Fortification(s) therein prohibit it. Palm debris may be Cleared as if the Location were Fallen rubble (<a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.71" class="topiclink">B24.71</a>).</p>
<p><a id="4.23"></a><img src="t423.jpg" width="483" height="150" alt="t423" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4.23 PALM-DEBRIS-PALM:</span> Some hexes contain palm debris with both the palm and debris depictions (EX: hex J12). A palm-debris-palm hex is a full-level LOS Hindrance. Placement of a Palm Debris counter in such a hex changes it to a normal palm debris hex.</p>
<p><a id="4.3"></a><img src="t43.jpg" width="493" height="150" alt="t43" style="float:left;margin:1px 1px 1px 1px; border:none" /><span class="f_Strong">4.3 BUILDING-PALM: </span>A hex containing both building and palm tree depictions is a Building-Palm hex (EX: hex Q10).</p>
<p><a id="4.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.31</span> &nbsp;In Building-Palm hexes, the terrain effects of both terrain types are cumulative as per <a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.1" class="topiclink">B.1</a>. That is, the entry COT (prior to any further modification) for Infantry is 3 MF and that for vehicles is 1 MP plus normal building COT.</p>
<p><a id="4.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.32</span> &nbsp;Units may bypass the building obstacle (unless otherwise prohibited; <a href="cha_cha4.htm#4.3" class="topiclink">A4.3</a>, <a href="chd_chd2.htm#2.3" class="topiclink">D2.3-.31</a>) by moving through the palm tree portion of the Building-Palm hex and in such case would be treated as if moving through a Palm location (<a href="cht_cht4.htm#4.1" class="topiclink">4.1</a>).</p>
<p><a id="4.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.33</span> &nbsp;A LOS through a Building-Palm hex (i.e., a LOS that is not blocked by the building) is subject to the normal palm tree LOS rules.</p>
<p><a id="4.34"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.34</span> &nbsp;The TEM of a Building-Palm hex is +2 or +3 according to the type of building (wooden or stone).</p>
<p><a id="4.35"></a><span class="f_Strong">4.35</span> &nbsp;The Kindling Number of a Building-Palm hex is that of the building.</p>
