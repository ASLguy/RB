<p><a id="6.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.1 COMMAND BUNKER:</span> A Command Bunker is a special type of Single-Story Stone Building and is represented on the BRT map as a stone building enclosed by two-toned brown contour lines (with the darker contour lines on the inside) (EX: hex Q38). A Command Bunker is treated as a Fortified Building and the contour lines are part of the building for LOS purposes. All Japanese Personnel units in a Command Bunker hex are considered Fanatic (<a href="cha_cha10.htm#10.8" class="topiclink">A10.8</a>) <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: such Fanatic status expires immediately at the end of a CG scenario]</span>, A unit entering from outside the Command Bunker hex becomes Fanatic immediately prior to all Defensive First Fire against it. A Japanese unit already Fanatic receives no further benefit. All fire from a Command Bunker is resolved as Area Fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: from the Rooftop Location (see <a href="cht_cht6.htm#6.12" class="topiclink">6.12</a>) or by a non-Captured Japanese MG]</span>. No Gun or vehicle may enter/set-up-in any Location of a Command Bunker. A Command Bunker is not burnable terrain and has a Morale Level of &quot;12&quot; for Bombardment purposes (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.8" class="topiclink">C1.8</a>).</p>
<p><a id="6.12"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.12 COMMAND BUNKER ROOFTOP: </span>A Command Bunker contains a Rooftop Location (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.8" class="topiclink">B23.8</a>) at Level 1 with a +2 TEM vs Direct Fire. A Command Bunker Rooftop Location is Concealment Terrain for setup purposes only. Once the first RPh has been completed, <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.82" class="topiclink">B23.82</a> comes into effect. A Command Bunker Rooftop Location is not considered a building Location for rout or Victory Condition purposes. Infantry units may directly enter a Rooftop location from an adjacent hex <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: across hexside L44-M45 as indicated by the lack of dark contour facing that hexside]</span> at a cost of 4 MF for Marines and 3 MF for Japanese.</p>
<p><a id="6.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.2 &nbsp;ISLAND COMMAND BUNKER:</span> Hex M45 contains the Island Command Bunker (ICB) which is a Command Bunker with a +5 TEM. &nbsp;FT attacks against this building must add the TEM to the attack unless the FT fires from within the same hex. The ICB may not be destroyed/rubbled in any way (including Bombardment).</p>
<p><a id="6.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.21 UNDERGROUND:</span> An underground location exists beneath the ICB as if it were a lower level of a building <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: this location is NA for building control purposes]</span>. The normal stacking capacity of an ICB underground location is two squad-equivalents. The ICB underground location is accessible (via an inherent stairwell) only from the ground level of the ICB and LOS to/from the ICB underground location is limited to the ground level of the ICB. The ICB underground location has a +4 TEM. Only Infantry/SW may set-up-in/enter the ICB underground location, and their presence therein is indicated by placing them beneath the ICB underground counter. As per <a href="cht_cht6.htm#6.32" class="topiclink">6.32</a>, any trench adjacent to an ICB is considered to connect to the ground level only (i.e. not the ICB underground location); however, a Passage (<a href="cht_cht6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">6.4</a>) can connect to the ICB underground location.</p>
<p><a id="6.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.3 BRT PILLBOXES:</span> Both HIP and &quot;free&quot; tunnels (<a href="chg_chg1.htm#1.632" class="topiclink">G1.632</a>) are NA for pillboxes on Betio.</p>
<p><a id="6.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.31 1+4+6 PILLBOX:</span> Use Cave counters to represent 1+4+6 pillboxes; treat these as pillboxes in all respects.</p>
<p><a id="6.32"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.32 &nbsp;BUNKERS:</span> The Japanese player automatically receives one Trench counter or Passage (<a href="cht_cht6.htm#6.4" class="topiclink">6.4</a>) for every two OB-given/purchased pillboxes (FRU). These trench counters must be used to create Bunkers (<a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.8" class="topiclink">B30.8</a>) and are restricted to setting up in the same setup area as that of the pillbox(es) they come with.</p>
<p><a id="6.33"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.33</span> &nbsp;All trenches are considered to &quot;connect&quot; (as per <a href="chb_chb30.htm#30.8" class="topiclink">B30.8</a>) to (but not through) all ADJACENT building Locations. Infantry entering such a building Location need not pay an extra MF to leave the trench in that location, but must still pay applicable building COT. Infantry leaving such a building Location need not pay an extra MF to enter a &quot;connecting&quot; trench. Infantry may not enter such a trench while using Bypass Movement; nor may they use Bypass Movement while in such a trench; nor may they exit such a trench to directly use Bypass Movement. A unit entering/leaving a building Location via a &quot;connecting&quot; trench is not subject to Snap Shots as it does so. A vehicle must pay the appropriate MP-costs/penalty to cross such a trench while using VBM; hence those vehicle types not allowed to cross a trench may not do so while using VBM. Infantry may enter a Fortified Building Location as if that Location were not fortified provided they enter it from a trench that is &quot;connected&quot; to that building Location.</p>
<p><a id="6.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.4 PASSAGE:</span> A Passage is a Fortification counter treated as a one-hex Tunnel (<a href="chb_chb8.htm#8.6" class="topiclink">B8.6</a>) and is obtained in lieu of a Trench counter. &nbsp;Its entrance/exit must be in a building, Pillbox, Bombproof, or Command Bunker Location. A Passage counter is eliminated when either of its entrance/exit Locations is eliminated or rubbled or per <a href="chb_chb8.htm#8.61" class="topiclink">B8.61</a>.</p>
<p><a id="6.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.5 BOMBPROOF:</span><span class="f_Exponent"><a href="cht_chtfootnotes.htm#2" class="topiclink">2</a></span> A bombproof is a Fortification counter that cannot set up in/adjacent to a Beach hex. Except as otherwise stated, a bombproof is treated as a pillbox with normal (<a href="cha_cha5.htm" class="topiclink">A5.</a>) Location stacking limits that does not have a CA.</p>
<p><a id="6.51"></a><span class="f_Strong">6.51 TEM/ATTACKS:</span> A bombproof has a +4 TEM and a Morale level of 10 vs Bombardment (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.822" class="topiclink">C1.822</a>). All fire from a bombproof is halved as Area Fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: non-Captured Japanese MG.]</span></p>
