<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="7.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.1</span> &nbsp;Towers represent tall, narrow building-like structures that contain an upper level Location with no ground level Tower Location (although the hex contains a Location at ground level), and are represented on the BRT map by an obviously square, single-hex brown structure containing a large white center dot (EX: F7, P9 and L49).<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="cht_chtfootnotes.htm#3" class="topiclink">3</a></span> A Tower (but not the ground level Location of its hex) is treated as a wooden building unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><a id="7.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.2</span> A BRT Tower is a 2½ Level LOS hindrance. Each Tower contains only a single Tower location at level 2. All Towers are subject to a -2 drm on any Rubble Creation dr (<a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.11" class="topiclink">B24.11</a>), and any result that would cause placement of rubble instead causes it to Collapse, eliminating all units in the Tower Location (see <a href="cht_cht7.htm#7.41" class="topiclink">7.41</a>) Place a Collapsed counter (<a href="chg_chg5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">G5.5</a>) on such a tower, after which <a href="chg_chg5.htm#5.51" class="topiclink">G5.51</a> applies. Every unit occupying the ground level Location of a Tower when it Collapses is subject to the appropriate <a href="chg_chg5.htm#5.5" class="topiclink">G5.5</a> PTC.</p>
<p><a id="7.21"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.21 STACKING: </span>The stacking capacity of a Tower hex's ground level Location is unaffected by the presence of the Tower. A Tower Location has a normal stacking limit (<a href="cha_cha5.htm#5.1" class="topiclink">A5.1</a>) of one HS-equivalent and 5PP. Towers have no Rooftop Locations and may never be Fortified.</p>
<p><a id="7.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.3 TEM:</span> A unit at the ground-level Location of a Tower hex is considered to be occupying the other terrain in that hex and so uses the TEM of that other terrain. A Tower Location has a TEM of 0, although units therein are eligible for the +1 Height Advantage TEM. Units entering a Tower hex/Location are not subject to FFMO, even if fired on from the same or higher elevation.</p>
<p><a id="7.4"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.4 MOVEMENT &amp; TEM:</span> The ground-level Location of a BRT Tower is Soft Sand (<a href="cht_cht3.htm" class="topiclink">3.</a>). A Gun may neither set up in nor enter, nor may a dm Gun be assembled in, a Tower hex/Location.</p>
<p><a id="7.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.41</span> Vehicles must use VBM to enter a Tower hex. Fully-Tracked, BU, CT, AFV may also enter the Tower obstacle as per <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.41" class="topiclink">B23.41</a> <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: a Tower has no cellar and adds an extra -1 drm to the colored dr of the AFV's Bog Check as though the tower was a single-story building, but see <a href="cht_cht7.htm#7.2" class="topiclink">7.2</a> if the AFV rolls a final colored dr ≤ 0.]</span></p>
<p><a id="7.42"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.42</span> Infantry may move to/from a Tower Location via the Tower's stairwell at a cost of 1 MF per level changed. A unit may never end it's MPh in an intermediate stairwell Location (i.e., it must end its MPh either in the Tower Location or in the Tower Hex's ground-level Location).</p>
<p><a id="7.43"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.43 </span> Infantry moving to/from a Tower Location via the Tower's stairwell may be attacked at ground level (if descending) and/or the Tower Location (if ascending) in the normal manner. They may also be attacked at the first-level &quot;quasi-Location&quot; of that hex by a unit that has a LOS to that quasi-Location. Such a quasi-Location is not considered Open Ground, but such an attack vs it receives no TEM. The target is assumed to expend one MF per level changed; if pinned or broken while at that quasi-Location it reverts to the level it was attempting to leave (and may be attacked by any Residual FP at that level as it re-enters it). The Residual FP left by an attack vs such a quasi-Location remains at that level (place the Residual FP counter on the appropriate Level counter) to attack each unit subsequently entering that level in that hex during the same MPh.</p>
<p><a id="7.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.5 &nbsp;CONCEALMENT:</span> The other terrain in a Tower hex determines whether or not the ground-level Location of that hex is Concealment Terrain. A Tower Location is treated like a building Rooftop (<a href="cho_chointro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">O.5</a>; <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.82" class="topiclink">B23.82</a>) for HIP/concealment purposes (only).</p>
<p><a id="7.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.6 &nbsp;ROUT:</span> A Tower hex/Location is not considered a building for rout purposes.</p>
<p><a id="7.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.7</span> &nbsp;The ground-level Location of a Tower hex is not considered a building Location for Victory purposes, but the Tower Location is.</p>
<p><a id="7.8"></a><span class="f_Strong">7.8</span> &nbsp;Towers have a Morale Level of 7 for Bombardment (<a href="chc_chc1.htm#1.8" class="topiclink">C1.8</a>) purposes. A Japanese unit in a Tower may act as a Spotter (<a href="chc_chc9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">C9.3</a>) for any mortar, 120L AA, 140L ART, or 8-in. Gun that is within three hexes of it as if such weapon was an adjacent mortar <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: the minimum range for any non-mortar, non-Type 92 Inf Gun (including the 8-in. Guns) is 7 hexes for Spotted Fire]</span>. Otherwise, normal minimum ranges apply. Spotted fire is treated as Indirect Fire.</p>
