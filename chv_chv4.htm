Each Rail Car depiction is a 1 Level LOS Obstacle <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Wrecked (<a href="chv_chv4.htm#4.7" class="topiclink">4.7</a>) or Gutted (<a href="chv_chv4.htm#4.8" class="topiclink">4.8</a>)]</span>. A Rail Car hex has a +2 TEM and is Concealment Terrain (<a href="cha_cha12.htm#12.12" class="topiclink">A12.12</a>). Rail Car hexes may be Kindled <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: if Gutted]</span> and have Kindling/Spread numbers of 8/9 respectively. Rail Car hexes are considered directly attached (<a href="chb_chb25.htm#25.62" class="topiclink">B25.62</a>) if one or more Rail Car depictions straddles the adjoining hexside (for an example see the <a href="chv_chv4.htm#4.2" class="topiclink">4.2</a> illustration).</p>

Bypass Movement would be possible in hex D29 along the D29-D28 hexside and also in hex D31 along the D31-D32 hexside.
