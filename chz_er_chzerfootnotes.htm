<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1. &nbsp; <a href="chz_er_chzerssr.htm#1" class="topiclink">SSR ER1 JUNGLE:</a></span> Historical mapsheets are able to display both Light Jungle and Dense Jungle at the same time by using different artwork for each, an option not readily available with standard geomorphic mapboards.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2. &nbsp; <a href="chz_er_chzerssr.htm#6" class="topiclink">ER6 ENTRENCHMENTS:</a></span> The Marines in general, and the Raiders and Paramarines in particular, were short on shovels and entrenching tools. &nbsp;Additionally, the ridge itself was exceptionally rocky. &nbsp;Both of these facts made it difficult for the Marines on Edson's Ridge to entrench and led to the trenches they constructed not being especially deep. Nonetheless, many accounts testify both to the importance in combat of these entrenchments, and to the reluctance of the Marines to abandon them. This, combined with the need for game units to have rally points available on the ridge, led to the rout bonus provided to Trenches and the Rally bonus provided to Foxholes.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3. <a href="chz_er_chzerssr.htm#7" class="topiclink">ER7 &amp; ER8 RAIDERS AND PARAMARINES:</a></span> U.S.M.C. Raiders and Paramarines play a prominent role on Edson's Ridge. Rather than rely on the standard 5-5-8 counter and SSRs for Marine Raiders and Paramarines, separate counters are being provided. This serves both to distinguish them from the standard 5-5-8 U.S.M.C. BAR squads that are also in use (minus the Assault Fire bonus that both &quot;elite&quot; units get), and to distinguish themselves from each other—an important feature in light of the high value that night combat in jungle places on Stealth. Besides using these counters when Edson's Ridge SSRs are in effect, players can also use them in other scenarios as appropriate, e.g., HS3 Tasimboko Raid and HS8 Bailey's Demise.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4. <a href="chz_er_chzercg.htm#cg15" class="topiclink">CG15 PRE-GAME BOMBARDMENT:</a></span> The standard bombardment area consisting of one geomorphic mapboard is obviously not suitable for use on a historical mapsheet, but we kept as close as possible to the standard concept in developing &nbsp;these &nbsp;rules, including sparing entire hexrows. Although plotting the bombardment area on the historical mapsheet is slightly more complicated, we felt that this procedure most accurately reflected the nature of bombardments on Guadalcanal. We considered using the round pattern from Kampfgruppe Pieper—a simpler mechanic—but we felt it delivers an attack that is too concentrated. However, players who wish to simplify ER bombardment plotting might wish to use the KGP method.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5. <a href="chz_er_chzercg.htm#cg17" class="topiclink">CG17 WIRE:</a></span> Wire played an important role in the defense of Edson's Ridge, but there was not much available. When utilized, it was strung out sparsely, thus making it easier to move through, on average, than a normal Wire counter.</p>
<p><a id="6"></a><span class="f_Strong">6. <a href="chz_er_chzercg.htm#cg18" class="topiclink">CG18 FPF BARRAGE:</a></span> The most effective OBA attacks for stopping an assault are Final Protective Fires—called here FPF Barrages. A FPF Barrage is a barrier of artillery fire laid down approximately 50 to 200 meters in front of the defensive position in an attempt to break up an enemy's final or most threatening assault. It is normally placed across the most dangerous infantry avenue of approach to the defensive lines, and as close to the entrenchment line as possible—no further than 200 meters away. Most FPF Barrages fired until the weapons ran out of ammunition. Machine-gun &quot;final protective lines&quot; (firelanes laid in front of the battle position) would also open up on the same signal, and were planned together with the FPF Barrage. Owing to the &quot;danger close&quot; nature of FPF Barrages, each artillery piece was individually registered for maximum possible accuracy. This careful and time-consuming process was readily noticed by nearby enemy, as reflected in the open designation of the Blast Area prior to setup. Sometimes the enemy would try to interfere with this registration process by firing occasional &quot;spotting rounds&quot; of his own, so as to confuse the opposing registration observer. Although FPF Barrages were standard practice of most powers by this time in the 20th Century, their use was relatively uncommon due to the time required for registration, the ammunition required for delivery, and the potentially ruinous effect on weapons used to deliver such sustained attacks.</p>
<p><a id="7"></a><span class="f_Strong">7. <a href="chz_er_chzercg.htm#1.41" class="topiclink">1.41 CG VICTORY CONDITIONS:</a></span> Victory Points are awarded to the Japanese for capturing hill hexes early, for exiting towards Henderson Airfield, and for having troops in the northern area at the end of the game (threatening Henderson). The Marines provide the Japanese with VP by calling on American assets that would be useful elsewhere. Additionally, the Japanese lose VP for using important assets that would be valuable elsewhere in the campaign and for using the Lost Battalion. (The Japanese expected that battalion to strike north toward Henderson Airfield while the rest of Kawaguchi's brigade attacked the ridge, but, owing to command failure, it never did. Historically, the Americans did commit troops in the area to protect their flank against the possible appearance of these Japanese troops.) This introduces a strategic element to purchasing reinforcements, requiring some tough decisions by both players.</p>
