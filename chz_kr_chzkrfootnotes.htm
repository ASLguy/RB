<p><a id="1"></a><span class="f_Strong">1. <a href="chz_kr_chzkrcg.htm#2" class="topiclink">KR 2. THE GORGE:</a></span> The Japanese believed the Gorge to be impassable to vehicular traffic. However, the American armor was indeed able to utilize it while covering the advancing infantry elements. The sheer sides, however, especially where they ran alongside Kakazu Ridge, proved particularly treacherous to vehicles attempting to exit onto higher ground.</p>
<p><a id="2"></a><span class="f_Strong">2. <a href="chz_kr_chzkrcg.htm#3" class="topiclink">KR 3. DEBRIS:</a> </span>The Debris on the Kakazu Ridge map represents the blasted vegetation that littered the top and slopes of Kakazu Ridge. The American shelling in the preceding days had stripped the trees on the hill of most of their branches and covered the ground to a depth of several feet with broken branches and blasted trees and rock. It was virtually impassable to armor and offered the Japanese perfect concealment for their underground defenses.</p>
<p><a id="3"></a><span class="f_Strong">3. <a href="chz_kr_chzkrcg.htm#4" class="topiclink">KR 4. CAVES:</a></span> The density of the Japanese fortifications on and around Kakazu Ridge was extremely high, even when compared to prepared defenses previously encountered by the Allies. These rules allow the Japanese player to concentrate his defenses more than is the norm in ASL terms, albeit at the risk of placing too many eggs in one basket, while still remaining true to the spirit of the cave rules.</p>
<p><a id="4"></a><span class="f_Strong">4. <a href="chz_kr_chzkrcg.htm#5" class="topiclink">KR 5. SPIGOT MORTAR CAVES:</a></span> &nbsp;The Japanese had several large caliber spigot mortars available for the defense of the ridge. These were mainly of the 320mm type and had been adapted for mounting on low ore carts for mobility. In order to fire these mortars, the crew had to actually wheel the piece out of the mouth of the cave to gain enough clearance. Consequently, the crew was extremely vulnerable to fire while doing so. The crews had arranged for crude grid coordinates allowing a semblance of directed fire. Though seldom accurate, these guns did provide a rude surprise to American troops concentrating for an assault. The Americans quickly learned to recognize caves housing these weapons (the tracks were usually visible) and went to great lengths to silence them once discovered.</p>
<p><a id="5"></a><span class="f_Strong">5. <a href="chz_kr_chzkrcg.htm#6" class="topiclink">KR 6. CAVE COMPLEXES:</a></span> The Japanese position in and around Kakazu Ridge had been prepared with a massive engineering effort. The entire ridge was honeycombed with tunnels and caves offering sanctuary from American air and artillery bombardment and prepared positions from which to interdict the attack. The Americans had some familiarity with this type of defense from their battles on other Pacific islands. They were not, however, initially prepared to find such an extensive network of fortifications in such an unassuming little hill as Kakazu. The use of predesignated complexes allows the Japanese to place caves and pillboxes anywhere on Kakazu Ridge and operates as a built-in mechanic to regulate underground movement within the ridge itself. The use of &quot;extra&quot; complexes allows the Japanese to place interconnected caves off of the ridge itself and lends the Japanese player some hidden cave placement in front of and behind the ridge.</p>
