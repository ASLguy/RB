<p><a id="11.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.1</span> All single-hex, stone buildings depicted on the RR map contain a Cellar<span class="f_Exponent"><a href="chz_rr_chzrrfootnotes.htm#6" class="topiclink">6</a></span> Location beneath their ground-level Location (i.e., at building Level -1). A Cellar Location is considered the equivalent of another non-rooftop building Location in that hex (even for falling rubble [<a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.12" class="topiclink">B24.12</a>] and Control purposes) except as specified otherwise. The Cellar Level is ignored when determining the Base Level of a building hex.</p>
<p><a id="11.11"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.11 TEM:</span> Cellar Locations have a TEM of +3. Cellar Locations may be Fortified. Cellar Locations are ignored for the purposes of <a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.912" class="topiclink">B23.912</a> (i.e., the Cellar need not be fortified to fortify the ground-level Location).</p>
<p><a id="11.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.2 ENTRY:</span> Only Infantry/SW may set-up-in/enter a Cellar, and their presence therein is indicated by placing them beneath a Cellar counter. Infantry may enter/exit the cellar level only from the building's ground-level Location.</p>
<p><a id="11.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.3 LOS:</span> Infantry in a Cellar tracing LOS outside of their building to a non-ADJACENT Location do so as if entrenched at ground level (<a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>), and trace LOS to an ADJACENT Location in the normal manner (<a href="chb_chb23.htm#23.25" class="topiclink">B23.25</a>). For the purposes of Height Advantage TEM (<a href="chb_chb10.htm#10.31" class="topiclink">B10.31</a>) and Night LV (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.7" class="topiclink">E1.7</a>) applicability, Cellar Locations are considered to be at the Base Level of the hex.</p>

Otherwise, a Cellar Location has no effect on the use of SW/Inherent-FP other than those normally caused by being fired from within a building. A DC may be Thrown from a Cellar Location only to an ADJACENT Location.</p>
<p><a id="11.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.41 SMOKE:</span> SMOKE at ground level in a Cellar hex affects different-level fire to/from the Cellar Location normally. The extra +1 Hindrance for outgoing fire (<a href="cha_cha24.htm#24.8" class="topiclink">A24.8</a>) is NA and fire between ADJACENT Cellar Locations is unaffected.</p>
<p><a id="11.5"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.5 BLAZE SPREAD:</span> A Blaze may spread to/from a Cellar Location only from/to an ADJACENT Location.</p>
<p><a id="11.6"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.6 RUBBLE:</span> A Cellar Location can be rubbled like any other building Location. If a Cellar Location is rubbled, it and all other building Locations in the hex cease to exist and the appropriate rubble counter is placed at ground level in that hex. All occupants and weapons are eliminated, as is its Fortified Building status (if any), and an AFV can no longer fall into it (<a href="chz_rr_chzrrssr.htm#11.61" class="topiclink">RR11.61</a>, <a href="chb_chb24.htm#24.4" class="topiclink">B24.4</a>).

In all cases the AFV is eliminated and leaves no wreck. Each Infantry unit in such a Cellar Location must take an immediate NMC; if it fails this NMC a dr (</span>∆<span class="f_EXC">) must then be made for each SW it possesses; a 6 eliminates that SW and a 4-5 malfunctions it]</span>. The removal of an AFV for falling into a cellar (e.g., in a single-hex wooden building) does not create a Cellar Location in that hex.</p>
<p><a id="11.7"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR11.7 ENCIRCLEMENT:</span> The principles of <a href="cha_cha7.htm#7.72" class="topiclink">A7.72</a> (Upper Level Encirclement) do not apply to Cellar Locations; i.e., a unit in a Cellar is not Encircled merely by having no exit to ground level.  </p>

<p><a id="12.1"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR12.1</span> A slope hexside represents an undulation in the terrain substantial enough to give an Up-Slope (<a href="chz_rr_chzrrssr.htm#12.2" class="topiclink">RR12.2</a>) unit a LOS advantage. On the RR map a slope hexside is represented by brown hash-marks along that hexside (EX: RRP6-P7). The entire hexside (inclusive of vertices) marked by a slope, but not the slope artwork itself, is considered part of that slope hexside.</p>
<p><a id="12.2"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR12.2 UP-SLOPE/DOWN-SLOPE:</span> A Location whose hex contains ≥ one slope hexside is either Up-Slope or Down-Slope to LOS drawn across that hexside to or from that hex. If the slope lines are in the Location's hex, the Location is defined as being Down-Slope across that hexside; if the lines are in an adjacent hex along the hexside common to both hexes, the Location is Up-Slope across that hexside. A Location can be both Up- and Down-Slope across two different slope hexsides.</p>
<p><a id="12.3"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR12.3 LOS:</span> Slopes are neither obstacles nor Hindrances. Being Up-Slope affects LOS only in that an Up-Slope Location is treated as being ¾ of a level higher than normal to LOS that begins or ends in that Location and crosses an Up-Slope hexside of that Location. Thus, barring other obstructions to LOS, an Up-Slope unit—even if not in a hill Crest-Line hex—can trace a LOS across an Up-Slope hexside of its hex to a lower elevation (i.e., across a hill Crest Line) and/or over (<a href="chb_chbintro.htm#.4" class="topiclink">B.4</a>) obstacles and Hindrances whose topmost obstacle/Hindrance height is &lt; the Up-Slope elevation of the viewing unit <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: entrenched LOS restrictions would still apply as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.21" class="topiclink">B9.21</a>, as would wall/hedge TEM as per <a href="chb_chb9.htm#9.3" class="topiclink">B9.3</a>]</span>. Otherwise, being Up-Slope or Down-Slope itself has no effect on LOS (e.g., slopes are ignored if the LOS goes through their hex or along their hexside, and also when calculating an <a href="cha_cha6.htm#6.41" class="topiclink">A6.41-.43</a> increase or decrease in the number of Blind Hexes caused by an intervening obstacle). Being Up-Slope itself can neither grant HA nor allow an Up-Slope unit to make a HD attempt. The presence of ≥ one slope hexside does not change the elevation of that hex's Base Level.</p>
<p><a id="12.31"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR12.31 FIRE LANE:</span> For the purposes of Fire Lane LOS/LOF drawn across ≥ one slope hexside, assume that the term &quot;same-level&quot; means &quot;same-Base-Level&quot;.

<p><a id="12.41"></a><span class="f_Strong">RR12.41 DIRECT-FIRE TEM:</span> Ground-level Infantry in a hex containing ≥ three (or two non-contiguous) Down-Slope hexsides may claim a +1 slope TEM vs Direct Fire <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: FT]</span>, provided the attack originates from a non-adjacent firer whose elevation advantage (if any) over that of the target is &lt; the range of the attack and the attacker's LOS crosses ≥ one of the target hex's Down-Slope hexsides. (<a href="cha_chaintro.htm#.5" class="topiclink">A.5</a> applies to a FG attack.) Slope TEM is cumulative with no other +TEM <span class="f_EXC">[EXC: Mud/Deep-Snow TEM]</span>. Being Up-Slope itself provides no TEM, does not negate the FFMO/FFNAM DRM, and does not affect Wall Advantage rules.</p>

Squad E can claim slope TEM if fired on by squad A or D, but not if fired on by squad B (whose LOS does not cross a Down-Slope hexside of DD13). Likewise, squad C could fire on adjacent squad E with no slope TEM and could claim the -1 FFMO if otherwise applicable, as could squad B.

If squad A places a Fire Lane counter in E15, all moving Infantry in CC13 (or DD12) can be attacked by that Fire Lane with no slope DRM (since those hexes are adjacent to the firer) but moving Infantry in DD14 and EE15 would receive the slope DRM, while moving Infantry in DD13 would receive both the slope DRM and slope TEM (<a href="chz_rr_chzrrssr.htm#12.41" class="topiclink">RR12.41</a>). Moving Infantry in EE14 (assuming there is a LOS) would not receive the slope DRM because CC12 is not Up-Slope to EE14, nor (for the same reason) would the slope DRM apply to Infantry attacked by a Fire Lane Snap Shot at hexside DD14-EE14.</span></p>
