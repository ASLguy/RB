<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">H Escape From Velikiye Luki</span></p>
<p>Scenario H - Escape from Velikiye Luki (PDF version), SSR1, the sentence “The Majority Squad type of both sides is Normal” is conflicting with the next sentence “All German units are Stealthy while all Russian units are Lax.” Should the first sentence be deleted?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A. </span>No. Majority Squad type is used for ?/cloaked stacks with regards to straying, Stealthy and Lax for all other purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">79 Bridge Of The Seven Planets </span></p>
<p>Playing scenario 79 Bridge Of The Seven Planets. An offboard Crew attempts to push their Gun onboard, but rolls &gt; the M#. Do they sit there waiting to try again in their next MPh, or are they lost? If they are lost, are they counted as eliminated for VP purposes?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> They sit there until the end of their turn and are then eliminated. Yes. {2}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">110 North Bank</span></p>
<p>What is the effect of Ammo Shortage on the British 57L AT Gun?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> It has a circled B11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Article “When Bad Things Happen to Good Weapons” [General 30.5] states that a Gun with an original B11 will during Ammo Shortage have an X11 (i.e., disable on an 11 or 12) and a Low Ammo number (LA#) of 10. However there has been recent errata in Journal 5 stating “A19.131: line 10 replace “all B#” with “all SW Original B#/X# [EXC: DC]” The Index definition of a SW is any weapon depicted on a half inch counter, so a Gun is not a SW. With this errata it would seem to be that a Gun with an original B11 will, when Ammo Shortage is in play, have a B11 (i.e., malfunctions, not disables on 11 or 12) and a LA# of 10. Likewise a Gun such as the British 57L AT with an Original B12 will malfunction on a 12 and have a LA# of 11 when Ammo Shortage is in effect. Is the above correct or am I missing something?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A. </span>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also would seem that with the J5 errata to A19.131 that vehicular MGs are not affected by Ammo Shortage unless the MG is the vehicle’s MA.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This conflicts with the previous (unofficial) Q&amp;A A19.131 Does Low Ammo apply to AFV MG?</p>
<p>A. No (unless MA), but Ammunition Shortage would (e.g., B# would be decreased by one, with original B# becoming X#).</p>
<p>A. That has been superseded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to clarify the recent A19.131 errata in J5, the British 57L AT Gun normally has B12. When Ammo Shortage is in effect it has a circled B11, meaning that the Gun will disable (not malfunction) on an Original TH DR of 12 and have a Low Ammo counter placed on an Original TH Dr of 11. Correct?</p>
<p>A. Correct. {2}</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">Shall the +2 for TK# with MOL in the AFPh be used in these scenarios or not? (It is a contradiction with the rules but the “note” suggests that the designer have just misread the rules and clarifies something that should not be used but I would like your ruling for it.)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Play them as the SSR says to.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">The Russian is the Scenario Attacker (despite setting up onboard), and the German is the Scenario Defender. Does this mean the Russian can use Cloaking?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A. </span>Yes, because the Russian is declared the Scenario Attacker, he can use Cloaking.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PB2 Howards Men</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">Does the mention in SSR 3 of PB2 that the British are Scenario Defender mean that the Germans are Scenario Attacker and therefore allowed Cloaking? (as would be the case in the equivalent CG Scenario of CG I) Or is there only a Scenario Defender for this scenario since a Scenario Attacker is not designated?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> No. Correct.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PB2 Howard’s Men</span></p>
<p>Does the mentioning in SSR 3 that the British is Scenario Defender mean that the Germans are Scenario Attacker and therefore is allowed Cloaking?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> No.</p>
<p>Or should it be interpreted that the British may use the rules for being Scenario Defender [EXC: Freedom of Movement] even though they are not Scenario Defender as per definition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Yes. {2}</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HS11 The Sand Spit</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">The scenario card for HS11 The Sand Spit seems to contradict rule E1.22 in that it assigns the U.S.M.C. an ELR of 5 but by E1.22 it would seem that the U.S.M.C. ELR should be 4. Is the card correct?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> The Marine ELR should be 4.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HS18 To The Matter Born</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">I presume that the British may deploy <span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Arial';">&ge;</span> 3 squads, so as to have all his infantry loaded as passengers in the Ram Kangaroos (as the setup instructions require)?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Correct.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A18 Sbeitla Probe</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">The Americans are the Scenario Defender in this night scenario; however, part of their initial OoB is required to set up In Motion. May these units be considered to already have Freedom Of Movement at scenario start?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> No.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">If I set up 5/8” dummies using the OB granted ? counters, are they required to take an NTC per the last sentence of SSR4?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Yes, but such 5/8” Dummy stacks need not be specified as to exactly which 5/8” stack is taking a NTC.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">J22 Oh Joy!</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">The Russians earn VP for the Trenches which in my view don’t count in the 10 (C)VP &gt; the German requirement. Say the Russians cause 17 CVP and take one &gt; trench for 20 VP. The Germans cause 10 CVP casualties back. Did the Russians win? The Russians only have 7 CVP more than the Germans and the requirement is 10 CVP more than the German total.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Russians did not win.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">There is an SSR (2) that states all German infantry take a NMC with their terrain TEM as a negative DRM. Does this cause loss of concealment?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> NMC does not cause “?” loss.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">Additionally, the Germans have dummies. Since dummies are not infantry, they shouldn’t take the NMC which makes sense. However, the NMC is not specified as being secret, so by announcing the hexes getting attacked, the German is revealing the number of units therein and by not declaring attacks vs dummies, he essentially is revealing which hexes have dummies. How should this be played?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Apply A12.14: “A Dummy stack out of the LOS of all enemy ground units uses a Morale Level of 7 when attacked, or when taking a PAATC (12.41), or a Bombardment MC (C1.82). Any K/KIA result eliminates the stack. Otherwise, the owner declares how many DRs (at least one) he will make; any failed MC or Pin result eliminates the entire stack.”</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">J54 Showtime</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">SSR 4 seems to present a difficulty. If the German player chooses chit #3, he will NEVER play with the additional forces listed (Pz VIE or Squad + 9-2 ldr + MMG)! If Russian chooses a lesser numbered chit, German wins the privilege of moving first, without receiving chit #3 forces. If Russian chooses chit #3 (i.e. a tie), the same result occurs...</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Good thing, too. The Germans would kick butt with another Tiger. But at least they get to move first if they really want to.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">The VC say “The Germans win at game end by Controlling all four board 38 buildings and....”</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">What happens if one side or the other rubbles one or more of the four single-story wooden buildings? Does it (a) give the Russian an automatic win, (b) decrease the number of buildings the German must control, or (c) mean that the German must control the remaining buildings plus any rubbled location?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> (b)</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">2nd part of the Victory Conditions… “.... Otherwise, the Germans win at game end if they have ≥ 13 CVP (from the 35th Infantry Division only) west of the river.” Does this mean that the 35th Infantry Division had to be responsible for causing ≥ 13 CVP on Partisan units west of the river?, or does it mean that the 35th Infantry Division had to move ≥ 13 CVP of its units/equipment across the river to the west side.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> This is not correct. This is correct.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">J92 Your Turn Now</span></p>
<p>Are the values for the Filipino LMG in “Your Turn Now” correct? If not, what should they be?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A. </span>No, they should be the 1PP, 2-6 values on the American LMG in Gung Ho! {2}</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">J99 On To Florence</span></p>
<p>What is the cost of a Staghound Armored Car moving from one road hex to another road hex through a road hexside, assuming otherwise clear terrain and no elevation change? Is it 3 MP or 1 MP?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> 3 MP. {2}</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">The SSR allows American units to setup on board 54. Can the gun and/or SW also setup with HIP units on board 54? Fortifications?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Guns and SW can set up on 54 but not fortifications.</p>
