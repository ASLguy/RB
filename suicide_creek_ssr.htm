Trip Wires do not provide Illumination, though they may be set up in the same Location as Trip Flares. Separate drs are required for any Location that has both Trip Wires and Trip Flares. A Trip Wire that has been set off is equivalent to a fired Starshell for the purpose of allowing Fire Lanes vs Bore Sighted hexes (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.71" class="topiclink">E1.71</a>) and the subsequent usage of Starshells/IR (<a href="che_che1.htm#1.9" class="topiclink">E1.9</a>).</p>
